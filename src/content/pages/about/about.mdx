Hi! We're Eugene and Anna, ages 38 and 37 respectively. 
We're based in Lisbon, Portugal.

**Between us, we've raised three children**: Eugene's two younger sisters, Sofia and Diana (now 19 and 20), and our daughter Alexandra, who's six. We’re both from tech industry. And we've both spent years trying to answer one question:

> **How do you raise a kid well when you didn't exactly get the manual yourself?**

For Eugene, that question showed up early. He was a teenager, watching his parents fight and eventually divorce. They weren't too bad, but the family had issues that left marks. He remembers sitting there thinking, **I'm not going to be like that.** He started studying psychology. Life took him through doing science, then into tech and business. But the question kept nagging at him. How do you raise kids without passing down the damage?

For Anna, it hit a few years before Alexandra was born. She was deep in work with her therapist, excavating her own childhood. They'd trace a character trait back to something her parents did (or didn't do), and she'd think: **That's where that came from.** It made her realize she didn't want to parent on autopilot and hope for the best. She wanted to give her daughter what she actually needed, on purpose.

So when Alexandra came along, we had a lot of theory. Psychology research. Developmental science. Strong opinions. What we didn’t have is a system we can just use instead digging through all our knowledge and figuring it out on the go.

That was about four years ago. We decided to stop just collecting knowledge and start building something we could actually apply. Something that worked in real life, not just in textbooks.

We started with storybooks.

We wrote stories for Alexandra, ones that modeled what healthy family dynamics actually look like. Parents who handle conflict well. Kids who struggle with real things and find their way through. Not preachy. Just... how we wished more families operated.

Because we're both tech people, we couldn't help ourselves. The storytelling turned into a system. The system had rules, developmental principles the stories should follow, with the science behind them and notes on how to adapt them to real life.

We gave the stories to friends. Their kids loved them. Then the friends started asking questions. Not just "can we have more stories?" but "why do you write the parents like that in the books?"

We started explaining. Then we started teaching. Then, well, you can see where this is going. Check out the main page for the latest thing we made :)
