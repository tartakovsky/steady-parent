# Welcome

This blog is for parents who want **calm, firm boundaries** without turning the house into a courtroom.

## What you’ll find here

- Simple scripts you can say out loud
- Short “what to do next” sequences
- Research summaries, translated into real-life actions

## Example table

| Situation | What you say | What you do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Refusing bedtime | “I won’t argue. It’s bedtime.” | Walk to the room, stay present, repeat once |
| Backtalk | “You can be upset. You can’t be rude.” | Pause, set boundary, offer repair later |
