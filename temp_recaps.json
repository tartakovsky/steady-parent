  "peacefulparenthappykids/elementary-schoolers": "The articles talks about key issues: shifting alliances and the directive parenting trap. It explains them as: elementary schoolers requiring adult scaffolding for social lives they cannot yet manage, but direct instructions making them feel incompetent. Proposing solutions: active facilitation of peer play, using \"wondering language\" to encourage perspective-taking, and the \"stuffed animal technique\" to model social scripts. Explaining why they work: empathic reflection helps children move past hurt to clearer problem-solving; expressive needs (I-statements) prevent defensive character judgments; and emotional distance allows kids to practice social mastery in a low-stakes context.",
  "peacefulparenthappykids/emotional-health": "The articles talks about key issues: the neuroscience of intimacy and the dissipation principle. It explains them as: empathy being a physical event in the right brain's insula that wires a child for structural emotional health, whereas repressed feelings pop out later as unmodulated behaviors or tics. Proposing solutions: \"feeling\" from the child's perspective, avoiding the \"dismissal trap,\" and providing emotional first aid for bruised feelings. Explaining why they work: felt understanding is the fastest way for emotions to evaporate; empathy doesn't make children dependent but gives them the strength to face reality; and unconditional acceptance of \"yucky\" feelings builds unshakeable self-esteem.",
  "peacefulparenthappykids/emotional-intelligence-social-skills-siblings": "The articles talks about key issues: the laboratory of sibling conflict and hero framing. It explains them as: social-emotional skills being developed through repeated practice and reflection rather than lectures or punishment, which only breeds resentment. Proposing solutions: the \"coaching question sequence,\" scripting exact turn-taking words, and a family policy of mandatory \"repair\" before bedtime. Explaining why they work: reflection builds the judgment needed for future choices; \"I\" statements shift communication from attack to expression; and empowering children to make things better (repair) strengthens relationships more than extracting forced, hollow apologies.",
  "peacefulparenthappykids/endorphins-for-childbirth-pain": "The articles talks about key issues: natural pain management and the \"cascade of intervention.\" It explains them as: endorphins being nature's intended painkillers triggered by empowerment, while epidurals significantly slow labor and increase risks for C-sections and long-term back pain. Proposing solutions: managing fear through birth stories (like \"Spiritual Midwifery\"), maintaining mobility/walking during labor, and trusting the relief of the pushing phase. Explaining why they work: emotional states directly influence endorphin effectiveness; the moment of greatest doubt often occurs just before full dilation; and evidence-based birth accounts provide the reassurance needed to allow nature's biological process to unfold.",
  "peacefulparenthappykids/engagement": "The articles talks about key issues: the pursuit of passion and the boredom of affluence. It explains them as: happiness coming from the engaged pursuit of goals (dopamine release) rather than attainment, while easy gratification from computer games can override developing interests. Proposing solutions: breaking big goals into small achievable steps, guarding against \"glittering emptiness,\" and rewarding effort as well as results. Explaining why they work: passion naturally develops self-discipline and creative stamina; full engagement inoculates children against destructive temptations; and acknowledging that every small positive action matters (the Starfish Story) prevents the hopelessness of large world problems.",
  "peacefulparenthappykids/escape-artist-child-leaving-house-plays-in-car": "The articles talks about key issues: unsupervised car play and the development of limit-testing. It explains them as: children not being \"bad\" but developmentally mapping their autonomy, while supervised car play isn't an error but requires a hard boundary regarding parent presence. Proposing solutions: installing high-mounted exterior locks immediately, using logical consequences for routine tasks, and sharing progress with skeptical partners. Explaining why they work: physical barriers are mandatory when stakes are life and death; reframing behavior as limit-testing reduces parental anger; and demonstrating results first is the most effective way to gain partner support for peaceful methods.",
  "peacefulparenthappykids/every-parents-number-one-responsibility": "The articles talks about key issues: parental emotional regulation and the \"inner voice\" effect. It explains them as: a parent's primary job after safety/feeding being to control their own state, because children inevitably act childishly and will learn relationship management by observing parent behavior. Proposing solutions: prioritizing self-regulation over child-control, using a calm tone to shape the child's lifelong inner monologue, and practicing perspective-taking exercises. Explaining why they work: parents cannot teach regulation they do not model; the tone of daily interaction becomes the voice in the child's head; and imagining being on the receiving end of one's own yelling builds the empathy required for change.",
  "peacefulparenthappykids/explaining-death-to-children": "The articles talks about key issues: the abandonment fear and the \"shell vs. spirit\" distinction. It explains them as: toddlers being unable to grasp finality, often interpreting loss as personal rejection or a lack of love, which can cause lasting psychological harm. Proposing solutions: concrete physical explanations (bodies as homes), maintaining an internal relationship through head-talk, and explicit permission to feel joy while grieving. Explaining why they work: naming the body as a cast-off \"shell\" reduces viewing trauma; telling children they don't need to take care of grieving adults prevents role-reversal; and continuing the connection internalizes the love, countering abandonment fears.",
  "peacefulparenthappykids/explaining-death": "The articles talks about key issues: the universality of loss and the \"unprepared parent\" problem. It explains them as: death being a mystery most people avoid discussing until they are in the throes of depleted emotional resources, making it harder to guide children effectively. Proposing solutions: using books as tools for normalizing grief and allowing repetitive reading of the same narratives. Explaining why they work: seeing others' loss reduces isolation; repetition is an active coping mechanism for passive emotional processing; and familiar stories allow children to work through complex themes at their own pace, whether through tears or silent feeling.",
  "peacefulparenthappykids/eye-contact-while-baby-is-nursing": "The articles talks about key issues: individual sensory regulation and the \"intimacy analogy.\" It explains them as: some babies closing eyes or looking away during nursing to manage sensory input and focus on physical pleasure, which is a normal form of baby self-regulation. Proposing solutions: trusting the baby's communication of their needs and not forcing eye contact when it's not sought. Explaining why they work: baby behaviors are phase-dependent and rarely predict permanent traits; contentment without eye contact is a sign of secure attachment; and forcing interaction during an intimate experience (like nursing) can be counterproductive to the baby's natural bonding process."
