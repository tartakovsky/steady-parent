# Restructure admin sidebar into two-level navigation tree

**Date:** 2026-02-09 17:14
**Scope:** landing/src/components/admin/admin-sidebar.tsx, landing/src/app/admin/spec/page.tsx

## Summary
Replaced flat sidebar with two-level tree: Dashboard, Spec (Taxonomy/Page Types/Cross-Linking/CTAs/Mailing Tags), Validation (Articles/Quizzes/Plan vs Reality/Kit Tags), Link Graph. Spec tab bar removed — tab selection driven by URL query param via sidebar links.

## Context & Problem
The admin sidebar was a flat list of 7 items. The Spec page had internal tabs. It was unclear what's a spec definition vs a validation result. User requested explicit grouping with tree-style indented navigation.

## Decisions Made

### Spec stays as one page, tabs driven by query param
- **Chose:** Sidebar links to `/admin/spec?tab=taxonomy` etc., page reads `useSearchParams()` instead of `useState`
- **Why:** Single API call, no route splitting needed, minimal change
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - Separate routes per spec tab — rejected because it's the same data from one API, would add complexity for no benefit

### Groups always expanded, no collapse toggle
- **Chose:** Static tree, always open
- **Why:** Small nav (12 items total), collapsing adds complexity with no benefit

### Group headers are non-clickable
- **Chose:** SPEC and VALIDATION are visual labels (uppercase, muted), not links
- **Why:** They don't map to any page — they're organizational grouping only

## Key Files for Context
- `landing/src/components/admin/admin-sidebar.tsx` — sidebar with tree navigation
- `landing/src/app/admin/spec/page.tsx` — spec page (reads tab from query param)
