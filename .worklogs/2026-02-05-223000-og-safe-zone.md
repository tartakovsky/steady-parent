# OG Image Safe Zone Redesign

## Changes

### Centered layout for cross-platform compatibility
- All critical content (score ring, headline, subheadline, domain bars) centered within the 800x500 safe zone
- Brand bar and CTA button placed in sacrificial outer area that may be cropped on WhatsApp/iMessage
- Score ring and headline stacked vertically and centered instead of side-by-side at edges
- Domain bars constrained to 700px max width, centered
- Generic quiz card also redesigned with same centered approach

## Why
OG images are 1200x630 but WhatsApp and iMessage crop to a squarer aspect ratio from the center. The previous layout had the score ring on the far left and domain bars extending to the far right — both would be cropped on mobile messengers.
