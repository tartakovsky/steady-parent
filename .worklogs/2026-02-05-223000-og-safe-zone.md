# OG Image Safe Zone Redesign

## Changes

### Hero-style layout matching result page, all within safe zone
- 200px left/right padding keeps everything within the 800px safe zone
- Score ring on LEFT, headline + subheadline on RIGHT (mirrors the actual result page hero)
- Domain bars stacked vertically as rows (name → bar → percentage) for readability
- Brand line centered at top inside safe zone
- No content in corners or edges that could be cropped
- Generic quiz card also uses same 200px padding approach

## Why
OG images are 1200x630 but WhatsApp and iMessage crop to a squarer aspect ratio from the center. The previous layout had the score ring on the far left and domain bars extending to the far right — both would be cropped on mobile messengers.
