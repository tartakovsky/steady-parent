# OG Image: Fix Font Weights with Inter from Google Fonts

## Changes

### Load Inter font at multiple weights for Satori
- Satori (the engine behind Next.js `ImageResponse`) doesn't use system fonts
- Without explicit font data, `fontWeight: 800` is silently ignored — all text renders at the same default weight
- Added `loadGoogleFont()` helper that fetches font CSS from Google Fonts API, extracts the font file URL, and returns the ArrayBuffer
- Loads Inter at weights 400, 600, 700, 800 in parallel
- In-memory cache so fonts are only fetched once per server instance
- Passed `fonts` array to both result and generic `ImageResponse` calls

## Why
The OG image was rendering all text at the same weight (regular), making titles, numbers, and buttons look thin/unbolded compared to the HTML preview. This was the main visual difference between the preview and the actual OG output.
