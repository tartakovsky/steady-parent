## Mapping to “What You Get”
You can bullet each lesson as a promise (“You will…”) and pair with the problem (“If you’re dealing with…”) so it feels practical and immediate.

Example:
- **If you’re tired of yelling** → Lesson 1 + 2  
- **If they ignore you** → Lesson 4  
- **If boundaries collapse** → Lesson 3  
- **If they lie or talk back** → Lesson 5  
- **If big emotions run the house** → Lesson 6  
- **If you feel guilty after snapping** → Lesson 9  
- **If you want resilience and self‑motivation** → Lesson 8 + 10
