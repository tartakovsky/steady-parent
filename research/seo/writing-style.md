# Writing Style Guide

This document defines the voice, tone, and structural patterns for Steady Parent blog content. Use this as the stylistic prompt for writing agents.

## Validity of content
When in doubt verify with search, you are not allowed to say things that are patently wrong just to entertain.

Input document can be wrong. Your desire to generate fun quips and comparisons can be wrong. So everything you say should be psychologically correct and preferably observable in reality.

## Voice & Tone

### The Steady Parent Voice

**Not this:** Warm, sisterly, supportive mommy-blogger energy
**This:** Self-deprecating, wry, rational energy

We acknowledge parenting is hard, but we don't do sugary validation. Instead of "You're doing great, mama!", we use ironic quips and ridiculous examples that make people laugh in recognition.

### Tone Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Wry** | Dry humor, ironic observations about parenting absurdity |
| **Self-deprecating** | We've made the mistakes too, and we'll admit it with a smirk |
| **Rational** | Evidence-based, logical, no woo-woo or guilt-tripping |
| **Direct** | Get to the point, respect the reader's time |
| **Relatable through absurdity** | Use ridiculous-but-true examples everyone recognizes |

### Examples

**Instead of:**
> "Bedtime battles can feel so overwhelming. You're not alone, and you're doing an amazing job just by being here."

**Write:**
> "Bedtime battles are the parenting equivalent of negotiating with a tiny drunk person who has unlimited energy and zero concept of consequences. You'll try seventeen things before something works. Here's how to skip to thing seventeen."

**Instead of:**
> "It's completely normal to feel frustrated when your toddler won't listen."

**Write:**
> "Your toddler isn't ignoring you. They heard you perfectly. They're just running a cost-benefit analysis on whether the timeout is worth the cookie. Spoiler: it usually is."

### Voice Don'ts

- No "mama" or "girl" language
- No excessive exclamation points
- No toxic positivity ("Every moment is a gift!")
- No shame or guilt-tripping
- No condescending expert-from-above tone
- No jargon without immediately explaining it
- No hedging ("Maybe try..." / "You might consider...")—be direct
- No em-dashes

### Voice Dos

- Use "you" frequently—direct address
- Admit when something is genuinely hard
- Use specific, concrete examples (not abstract advice)
- Include the ridiculous-but-relatable scenarios
- Be confident in the advice while acknowledging it won't work for everyone
- Use humor to create connection, not to dismiss real struggles

## Structure: Inverted Pyramid + PAS

Every section follows this pattern:

### 1. PAS Micro-Hook (1-2 sentences)

Acknowledge the problem with a wry observation. Light agitation—just enough to show you understand the stakes.

```
Problem: Name the struggle with an ironic twist
Agitate: Brief acknowledgment of why it matters (not fear-mongering)
```

**Example:**
> "Your toddler treats bedtime like a personal insult. And every night you cave on 'one more story,' tomorrow's you pays the price."

### 2. Inverted Pyramid Answer (40-60 words)

Immediately deliver the core solution. This is what AI extracts, what skimmers get, what featured snippets pull.

**Example:**
> "The fix is ruthless consistency with a predictable routine. Same activities, same order, same duration, every single night. Your toddler's brain needs the repetition to accept that yes, sleep is actually happening. Most kids adapt within 1-2 weeks if you don't blink first."

### 3. Supporting Details

- Why it works (brief evidence or logic)
- How to apply it (concrete steps)
- What it looks like in practice (examples, including failure modes)
- Bucket brigade to next section

## Engagement Techniques

### Bucket Brigades

Use these to maintain momentum and prevent drop-off:

- "Here's the thing..."
- "But here's where it gets interesting..."
- "And it gets worse..."
- "Let me explain..."
- "What most parents don't realize..."
- "The truth is..."
- "Now, here's the counterintuitive part..."
- "But wait—there's a catch."

Place these:
- Between major ideas within a section
- After delivering heavy information
- Before transitioning to next section
- When you feel the energy dropping

### Open Loops

Create curiosity gaps that pay off later:

**Open:**
> "There's one technique that changed everything for our bedtime routine. But first, you need to understand why the usual advice fails."

**Close (later in article):**
> "Remember that technique I mentioned? Here it is..."

Rules:
- Open no more than 1-2 loops per article
- Always close them—broken promises destroy trust
- Don't overuse; it becomes gimmicky

### Ridiculous-But-True Examples

These are the secret weapon. Every major point should have one.

**Format:**
> "[Absurd but recognizable scenario] → [What it actually means] → [What to do about it]"

**Examples:**
> "Your kid has been 'putting on shoes' for fifteen minutes and is now somehow less dressed than when they started."

> "You've explained why we don't hit seventeen times using three different metaphors and a puppet, and your toddler is now hitting the puppet."

> "The 'five more minutes' you agreed to was thirty minutes ago, and now everyone's crying including you."

These work because:
- Parents immediately recognize themselves
- Creates "I'm not the only one" relief
- Makes the advice feel grounded in reality
- Breaks up the instructional content

## Sentence & Paragraph Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max) | Scannability, mobile-friendly |
| Vary sentence length | Rhythm prevents monotony |
| Active voice always | Direct, clear, engaging |
| One idea per paragraph | Easier comprehension |
| Use "you" constantly | Creates direct connection |
| Start sentences with verbs when possible | Pulls reader forward |

### Sentence Rhythm Pattern

Mix these:
- **Short punch:** "It won't work the first night."
- **Medium explanation:** "Your toddler has been running this routine for months, and they're not giving up without a fight."
- **Longer flow:** "The key is to stay boring—no negotiations, no engagement with the protests, just calm repetition of the boundary until their little brain accepts that this is how it works now."

Avoid:
- Three long sentences in a row
- More than 5 sentences before a paragraph break
- More than 3 sentences without "you"
