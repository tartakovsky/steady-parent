---

## Validated Instruments Found

### 1. Readiness for Weaning Scale (RWS)
- **Citation:** Turkmen, H. (2024). Readiness for Weaning Scale: Development and psychometric measurement study. *Infant and Child Development*, e2471.
- **What it measures:** Mother-and-baby readiness for weaning (transition away from breastfeeding / introduction of complementary foods).
- **Items:** 19 items, 5-point Likert (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Score range 19-95.
- **Factors (4):**
  1. Weaning intention (mother's plan/timeline)
  2. Infant's readiness (developmental/behavioral signs the baby can handle transition)
  3. Weaning techniques (knowledge of how to wean)
  4. Mother's readiness (emotional/practical preparedness)
- **Psychometrics:** Cronbach's alpha = 0.793; KMO = 0.802; 4 factors explain 60% of variance.
- **Population:** 265 mothers with infants 18+ months (Turkey).
- **Relevance:** The "Infant's readiness" subscale directly maps to what we need. However, items are not publicly available in English, and the scale is oriented toward weaning FROM breastmilk rather than readiness FOR solids. The 4-factor structure (parent intention, baby signs, technique knowledge, parent readiness) is a useful conceptual model.

### 2. Behaviors of Transition to Complementary Feeding Scale (BTCF-S)
- **Citation:** Kurtuncu, M. & Arslan, N. (2024). Behaviors of Transition to Complementary Feeding Scale: A Scale Development Study. *Cyprus Journal of Medical Sciences*.
- **What it measures:** Infant behavioral responses during the complementary feeding transition (6-24 months).
- **Items:** 28 items, 5-point Likert (1 = never to 5 = always). 16 items reverse-scored. Score range 28-140.
- **Factors (5):**
  1. Positive nutrition time
  2. Willingness to be fed
  3. Negative nutrition time
  4. Unwillingness to be fed
  5. Refusal to be fed
- **Psychometrics:** Cronbach's alpha = 0.95 overall; subscales 0.75-0.95; R2 = 64.56%.
- **Relevance:** Measures feeding DURING transition, not readiness BEFORE it. Useful for understanding what "interest signals" and "willingness" look like behaviorally, but not directly applicable as a readiness screener.

### 3. Child Oral and Motor Proficiency Scale (ChOMPS)
- **Citation:** Pados, B.F., Thoyre, S.M., et al. (2019). Development and Content Validation of the Child Oral and Motor Proficiency Scale. *Topics in Early Childhood Special Education*.
- **What it measures:** Eating, drinking, and related oral-motor skills in children 6 months to 7 years.
- **Items:** 63 items, 3-point scale (Yes / Sometimes / Not Yet). Parent-report.
- **Subscales (4):**
  1. Basic Movement Patterns (mastered by ~24 months for 95% of children)
  2. Fundamental Oral-Motor Skills (mastered by ~4 years)
  3. Oral-Motor Coordination (mastered by ~5 years)
  4. Complex Movement Patterns (latest to develop)
- **Norm data:** Age-based normative reference values published (Sanchez et al., 2018).
- **Relevance:** Highly relevant for oral-motor domain. The "Basic Movement Patterns" subscale covers exactly the skills needed for initial solid food consumption (tongue movement, chewing initiation, swallowing coordination). Parent-report Yes/Sometimes/Not Yet format is close to our 3-option approach.

### 4. Preterm Oral Feeding Readiness Assessment Scale (POFRAS)
- **Citation:** Fujinaga, C.I. et al. (2013, validated Taiwan 2021, Turkey 2020). Clinical validation of the Preterm Oral Feeding Readiness Assessment Scale.
- **What it measures:** Whether preterm infants are ready to transition from tube to oral feeding.
- **Items:** 18 items, scored 0-2 each. Total range 0-36; cut-off score = 30.
- **Domains (5):**
  1. Corrected gestational age
  2. Behavioral organization (state of consciousness, posture, overall tone)
  3. Oral posture (lip and tongue posture)
  4. Oral reflexes (search, suction, bite, gag)
  5. Non-nutritive sucking (tongue movement, mandible movement, suction rhythm)
- **Relevance:** Designed for preterm infants in NICU, not for term infants starting solids. However, the domain structure (behavioral state, oral posture, reflexes, sucking patterns) provides a clinically-validated framework for thinking about oral-motor readiness dimensions.

### 5. Infant and Child Feeding Questionnaire (ICFQ)
- **Citation:** Feeding Matters (2020). Psychometric properties validated by Pados et al. (2020) in *Journal of Pediatrics*.
- **What it measures:** Screening for pediatric feeding disorder (PFD) in children 0-4 years. Parent-report.
- **Items:** Age-specific versions (up to 36 months). 6-item screener achieves 73% sensitivity, 93% specificity.
- **Domains (4):** Medical, nutrition, feeding skill, psychosocial.
- **Relevance:** Clinical screening tool for feeding PROBLEMS, not readiness assessment. But the 4-domain PFD framework (medical, nutritional, skill-based, psychosocial) is analogous to our multi-domain approach.

### 6. Feeding Practices and Structure Questionnaire — Infant Version (FPSQ-I)
- **Citation:** Jansen, E. et al. (2021). Development and validation of age appropriate versions for infants and toddlers. *International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity*.
- **What it measures:** Parental feeding practices (responsiveness, structure) during milk and solid feeding.
- **Items:** Milk version: 18 items (4 factors); Solid version: 21 items (4 factors) + 19 items for 12+ months (2 additional factors).
- **Factors (solid version):** Feeding on demand vs. routine, using food to calm, persuasive feeding, parent-led feeding.
- **Relevance:** Measures HOW parents feed, not whether baby is READY. Not directly applicable but informs the "parent readiness" angle.

## Domains/Factors Identified

Synthesizing across instruments, guidelines (WHO 2023, AAP, ESPGHAN 2017), and clinical literature, the research identifies these dimensions of solid food readiness:

### Domain 1: Gross Motor / Postural Readiness
- **What it covers:** Head control, trunk stability, sitting ability
- **Evidence strength:** STRONG. WHO 2023 guideline specifically cites sitting without support as associated with GI, renal, and immunological maturation. AAP and ESPGHAN both list this as a primary criterion.
- **Observable signs:**
  - Can hold head upright and steady while seated (~15 min)
  - Can sit in a high chair with minimal support without slumping
  - Trunk stability sufficient to use both hands while seated

### Domain 2: Oral-Motor Readiness
- **What it covers:** Tongue movement, loss of extrusion reflex, emerging chewing pattern, swallowing coordination
- **Evidence strength:** STRONG. ChOMPS Basic Movement Patterns subscale validates this dimension. POFRAS oral posture/reflexes domains clinically validate the constructs. AAP and clinical SLPs identify tongue-thrust reflex diminishment as key.
- **Observable signs:**
  - Tongue-thrust (extrusion) reflex has diminished — food placed on tongue is not automatically pushed out
  - Emerging "munching" pattern (up-down jaw movement)
  - Can move food from front of mouth toward back for swallowing
  - Opens mouth when spoon approaches

### Domain 3: Interest & Behavioral Signals
- **What it covers:** Food curiosity, reaching behaviors, mealtime engagement, hunger cues beyond milk
- **Evidence strength:** MODERATE-STRONG. BTCF-S "willingness to be fed" factor validates this as a measurable construct. AAP, WHO, and all clinical guidelines list interest in food as a readiness sign. Qualitative research confirms parents use these cues as primary decision input.
- **Observable signs:**
  - Watches others eat intently
  - Reaches for food on your plate
  - Opens mouth when food approaches (anticipatory behavior)
  - Mimics chewing motions while watching others eat
  - Leans forward toward food

### Domain 4: Fine Motor / Self-Feeding Coordination
- **What it covers:** Hand-to-mouth coordination, grasping ability, object manipulation
- **Evidence strength:** MODERATE. ChOMPS measures this. AAP lists hand-to-mouth coordination. BLW literature emphasizes this for finger foods specifically. Less relevant for spoon-fed purees.
- **Observable signs:**
  - Brings hands and toys to mouth consistently
  - Can grasp objects (raking grasp sufficient initially)
  - Developing hand-eye-mouth coordination

### Domain 5: Physiological / Digestive Maturity (NOT directly parent-observable)
- **What it covers:** GI tract maturation, enzyme production, kidney function, immune readiness
- **Evidence strength:** STRONG in literature but NOT PARENT-OBSERVABLE. Salivary amylase increases around 3-4 months. GI maturation associated with sitting ability (WHO 2023). Pancreatic amylase not fully functional until ~28 months.
- **Key insight:** This cannot be directly assessed via parent questionnaire. The WHO guideline uses sitting without support as a PROXY for physiological maturation. Our quiz should NOT include a "digestive readiness" domain with direct questions — instead, age and sitting ability serve as proxies.

### Domain 6: Parent Readiness / Contextual Factors
- **What it covers:** Parent knowledge, confidence, practical setup, timing context
- **Evidence strength:** MODERATE. RWS validates "mother's readiness" and "weaning intention" as distinct factors. Qualitative research shows parent confusion about guidelines is a major factor in early/late introduction.
- **Observable signs:**
  - Has a high chair or appropriate feeding seat
  - Understands what foods to start with
  - Baby is around 6 months of age (timing factor)
  - No major transitions or stressors happening (similar to potty training readiness)

## Item Types & Response Formats

### How validated instruments ask questions:

**ChOMPS (closest to our use case):**
- Format: "Can your child [specific observable behavior]?"
- Response: Yes / Sometimes / Not Yet
- Example pattern: Direct observation of a specific motor skill
- Parent fills out based on what they've observed

**RWS:**
- Format: Attitude/belief statements rated on agreement scale
- Response: Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree (5-point Likert)
- Mixes baby-observation items with parent-attitude items

**BTCF-S:**
- Format: Frequency of observed behaviors
- Response: Never / Rarely / Sometimes / Often / Always (5-point Likert)
- Focuses on mealtime behaviors during feeding

**POFRAS (clinician-administered):**
- Format: Clinician observes and rates specific behaviors during assessment
- Response: 0-2 scale per item
- Not applicable for parent self-report

**Potty training quiz (our existing model):**
- Format: "Does your child [observable behavior]?" or "Can your child [specific skill]?"
- Response: 3 options with varied point values (e.g., "Yes, regularly" = 3, "Sometimes" = 1, "No" = 0)
- Each question has explanatory subtext
- Each question cites a specific source

## Key Items We Can Adapt

Based on validated instruments and clinical guidelines, here are specific question types organized by domain:

### Gross Motor / Postural (3-4 questions)
1. **Sitting stability:** "Can your baby sit upright in a high chair without slumping to the side?" (AAP, WHO 2023)
2. **Head control:** "Does your baby hold their head steady and upright while seated?" (AAP, ESPGHAN)
3. **Trunk support:** "How much support does your baby need to sit upright?" (ChOMPS basic movement patterns)

### Oral-Motor Readiness (2-3 questions)
4. **Tongue-thrust reflex:** "When you touch a spoon to your baby's lips, do they push it out with their tongue?" (AAP, clinical SLP consensus) — reverse-scored
5. **Mouth opening:** "Does your baby open their mouth when a spoon or food approaches?" (AAP, BTCF-S willingness factor)
6. **Food movement:** "If your baby gets a small taste of puree, can they move it toward the back of their mouth to swallow?" (ChOMPS, POFRAS oral motor domains)

### Interest & Behavioral Signals (2-3 questions)
7. **Watching others eat:** "Does your baby watch intently when you or others eat?" (AAP, WHO, universal clinical criterion)
8. **Reaching for food:** "Does your baby reach for food on your plate or try to grab what you're eating?" (AAP, BLW readiness literature)
9. **Mealtime eagerness:** "When seated at the table during family meals, does your baby lean forward or get excited?" (BTCF-S positive nutrition time factor)

### Fine Motor / Coordination (1-2 questions)
10. **Hand-to-mouth:** "Does your baby bring toys or hands to their mouth regularly?" (AAP, ChOMPS)
11. **Grasping:** "Can your baby pick up objects and hold onto them?" (ChOMPS basic movement, BLW readiness)

### Age & Context (1 question, non-scored or weighted)
12. **Age check:** "How old is your baby?" with ranges (under 4 months / 4-5 months / around 6 months / 7+ months) — This serves as guardrail, not primary scoring.

## Gaps

### What quiz-ideas.md proposes vs. what research supports:

| quiz-ideas.md Domain | Research Support | Gap/Issue |
|---|---|---|
| **Oral motor skills** | STRONG — validated by ChOMPS, POFRAS, AAP, clinical SLP consensus | Well-supported. Keep. |
| **Interest signals** | MODERATE-STRONG — BTCF-S validates as factor; all guidelines list it; qualitative research confirms parents rely on it | Well-supported. Keep. |
| **Digestive readiness** | NOT PARENT-OBSERVABLE — GI maturation is real but happens internally. No validated parent-report items exist for this. WHO uses sitting as proxy. | **Rename or replace.** Parents cannot observe enzyme production. We should either (a) drop this as a separate domain and let age + sitting serve as proxies, or (b) rename to "Age & Developmental Timing" with items about age range and weight doubling. |
| **Sitting stability** | STRONG — WHO 2023 #1 criterion, AAP primary sign, ESPGHAN includes it | Well-supported but should be expanded to "Gross Motor / Postural Readiness" to include head control and trunk stability. |

### Additional gap: Fine motor coordination
- ChOMPS and BLW literature validate hand-to-mouth coordination as a distinct readiness indicator
- quiz-ideas.md doesn't list this as a domain
- Could be folded into "oral motor" or added as its own domain

### Missing from quiz-ideas.md but validated in research:
- **Loss of tongue-thrust reflex** — one of the most clinically important signs, not explicitly called out as a domain
- **Age guardrail** — ESPGHAN says not before 17 weeks, not after 26 weeks; our quiz should include age as a contextual factor
- **False readiness signals** — research shows parents misinterpret night waking, increased hunger, watching food as definitive signs when they may not be (KellyMom, clinical literature)

## Recommended Approach

### Domain Structure (revised from quiz-ideas.md)

Replace the 4 proposed domains with 3 evidence-based domains plus an age/context factor:

1. **Gross Motor Readiness** (replaces "sitting stability" — expanded)
   - Head control, sitting stability, trunk support
   - 3 questions, max ~7-9 points
   - This is the strongest single predictor (WHO 2023 uses it as proxy for physiological maturation)

2. **Oral-Motor Readiness** (kept, refined)
   - Tongue-thrust reflex diminishment, mouth opening, food movement
   - 2-3 questions, max ~6-7 points
   - Directly maps to ChOMPS Basic Movement Patterns

3. **Interest & Feeding Cues** (replaces "interest signals" + absorbs "digestive readiness")
   - Watching others eat, reaching for food, mealtime eagerness, hand-to-mouth behavior
   - 3 questions, max ~7-9 points
   - Combines BTCF-S "willingness" factor with AAP behavioral criteria

4. **Age factor** (non-domain, but used as guardrail/context)
   - Single question about baby's age
   - Under 4 months = strong "not yet" signal regardless of other scores
   - 4-5 months = proceed with caution messaging
   - 6+ months = age-appropriate timing

### Drop "Digestive Readiness" as a domain
- No validated parent-report items exist for internal physiological maturation
- WHO explicitly links sitting ability to GI/renal/immune maturation — sitting IS the observable proxy
- Trying to ask parents about digestive readiness would produce unreliable, anxiety-inducing questions ("Has your baby's pancreatic amylase matured?" is not a thing)

### Question Format
- Follow existing potty-training quiz pattern: 3 options per question with point values (high/some/none)
- Include subtext explaining what to look for (e.g., "Try touching a small spoon to their lips and watch what their tongue does")
- Cite sources per question
- 8-10 questions total (3 gross motor + 2-3 oral motor + 3 interest/cues + 1 age)

### Result Tiers
- **Green Light / "Your Baby Shows Strong Readiness Signs"** — most signs present across all domains
- **Yellow Light / "Getting Close — A Few More Weeks"** — some signs present, some developing
- **Red Light / "Not Quite Yet — And That's Perfectly Normal"** — most signs not yet present

### Critical Messaging Notes
- Emphasize that readiness is about developmental milestones, NOT a strict age cutoff
- Include disclaimer: "This quiz is not a substitute for your pediatrician's guidance"
- Address common false signals: night waking, increased hunger, and watching food do NOT alone mean readiness
- All results should be warm and non-judgmental — "not ready yet" is framed as "your baby is developing at their own pace"
- Include a note about premature babies (use adjusted age)

### Age Range
- Target: parents of babies 4-8 months
- Below 4 months: immediate "too early" result with explanation
- Above 8 months and not yet started: encourage pediatrician consultation
