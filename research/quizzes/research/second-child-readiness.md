## Validated Instruments Found

### 1. Parenting Stress Index, 4th Edition — Short Form (PSI-4-SF)
- **What it measures:** Parental stress across three domains: Parental Distress (PD), Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction (P-CDI), Difficult Child (DC), plus Total Stress
- **Items:** 36 items (12 per subscale)
- **Format:** 5-point Likert scale + direct response; ~10 min administration
- **Reliability:** alpha .78-.88 for subscales; .96+ for domain/total scores
- **Relevance:** Directly measures whether a parent is already at capacity. High PSI scores = red flag for expanding family without intervention.

### 2. Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC / PSOC-R)
- **What it measures:** Two factors: Satisfaction (affective — frustration, anxiety, motivation) and Efficacy (instrumental — competence, problem-solving, capability)
- **Items:** 17 items original; 16 items revised (PSOC-R: 10 efficacy + 6 satisfaction)
- **Format:** 6-point Likert (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
- **Reliability:** Rated "A — Psychometrics Well-Demonstrated" by CEBC; good invariance across samples
- **Relevance:** Parents who feel competent and satisfied with child #1 have more bandwidth for child #2. Low efficacy = practical skills gap to address first.
- **Source:** Gibaud-Wallston & Wandersman (1978); Gilmore et al. (2024) revision

### 3. Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA)
- **What it measures:** Four dimensions: exhaustion in parental role, contrast with previous parental self, feelings of being fed up, emotional distancing from children
- **Items:** 23 items
- **Format:** Frequency-based (how often do you experience...)
- **Reliability:** Good validity; factorial invariance across gender and languages (N=901)
- **Relevance:** Burnout is the clearest contraindication for adding a child. Burned-out parents adding more load = risk factor for the whole family.
- **Source:** Roskam, Mikolajczak et al. (2018), Frontiers in Psychology

### 4. Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS / DAS-4)
- **What it measures:** Relationship quality across four subscales: Dyadic Consensus (agreement), Dyadic Satisfaction, Dyadic Cohesion (shared activities), Affectional Expression
- **Items:** 32 items (full); 4 items (DAS-4 brief version)
- **Format:** Mixed — most items 0-5 Likert; some 0-4; range 0-151
- **Reliability:** alpha .70 (Affectional Expression) to .95 (Total); DAS-4 as effective as DAS-32 at predicting couple dissolution
- **Relevance:** Relationship quality is the single strongest predictor of family adjustment after second birth. The DAS-4 is particularly useful for quiz-length adaptation.
- **Source:** Spanier (1976); Sabourin et al. DAS-4 brief version

### 5. Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS)
- **What it measures:** Global relationship satisfaction
- **Items:** 7 items
- **Format:** 5-point Likert (1=low satisfaction to 5=high satisfaction); items 4 and 7 reverse-scored
- **Reliability:** alpha .86-.90 across studies; high convergent validity with DAS
- **Relevance:** Even briefer than DAS-4. Good for quick-screen relationship health. Validated across dating, cohabiting, and married couples.
- **Source:** Hendrick (1988); Hendrick, Dicke & Hendrick (1998)

### 6. Dyadic Coping Inventory (DCI)
- **What it measures:** How couples cope with stress together — stress communication, supportive coping, delegated coping, negative coping, common coping
- **Items:** 37 items
- **Format:** 5-point scale (1=very rarely to 5=very often)
- **Reliability:** Confirmed convergent/discriminant validity; measurement invariance across gender and culture
- **Relevance:** Adding a child is a major stressor. Couples who cope well under stress adapt better. This measures the mechanism, not just the state.
- **Source:** Bodenmann et al. (2008)

### 7. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)
- **What it measures:** General perceived stress — how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded one's life feels
- **Items:** 10 items (superior psychometrics to PSS-14 and PSS-4)
- **Format:** 5-point frequency scale (0=never to 4=very often); 4 reverse-scored items; range 0-40
- **Reliability:** alpha >.70 in all 12 validation studies; test-retest >.70 in all 4 studies
- **Relevance:** Baseline stress load. If life already feels uncontrollable, adding a baby amplifies that. General rather than parenting-specific, which captures work/life/financial stress too.
- **Source:** Cohen, Kamarck & Mermelstein (1983); Lee (2012) review

### 8. Confusion, Hubbub and Order Scale (CHAOS)
- **What it measures:** Household chaos — noise, clutter, disorganization, frenetic activity, lack of routine
- **Items:** 15 items (long form); 6 items (short form)
- **Format:** True/False (yes/no); higher score = more chaos
- **Reliability:** alpha .79; test-retest r=.74 at 12 months
- **Relevance:** Household chaos is a concrete, practical indicator. If your home is already chaotic with one child, adding another has real implications. This is the "logistical readiness" proxy.
- **Source:** Matheny et al. (1995); short form evaluated by Coldwell et al.

### 9. Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)
- **What it measures:** Perceived support from three sources: Significant Other, Family, Friends
- **Items:** 12 items (4 per subscale)
- **Format:** 7-point Likert (1=very strongly disagree to 7=very strongly agree)
- **Reliability:** Good internal and test-retest reliability; robust three-factor structure confirmed via CFA
- **Relevance:** Social support is a critical buffer for the transition. Parents without support networks struggle more with two children. Negative correlation with parenting stress confirmed in Chinese parenting samples.
- **Source:** Zimet et al. (1988)

### 10. McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD)
- **What it measures:** Family functioning across 6 dimensions: Problem Solving, Communication, Roles, Affective Responsiveness, Affective Involvement, Behavioral Control, plus General Functioning
- **Items:** 60 items (full); 12-item General Functioning subscale available
- **Format:** 4-point scale (1-4); higher scores = worse functioning
- **Cut-offs:** Problem Solving (2.2), Communication (2.2), Roles (2.3), Affective Responsiveness (2.2), Affective Involvement (2.1), Behavioral Control (1.9), General Functioning (2.0)
- **Relevance:** The General Functioning subscale is a validated 12-item screener for overall family health. Families already struggling with communication and roles will find those issues amplified.
- **Source:** Epstein, Baldwin & Bishop (1983)

### 11. Childbearing Questionnaire / Childbearing Motivations Scale (CBQ / CMS)
- **What it measures:** Positive and negative motivations for having children
- **CBQ subscales (positive):** satisfaction of child rearing, feeling needed/connected, instrumental values, traditional parenthood, joys of pregnancy/birth/infancy
- **CBQ subscales (negative):** discomforts of pregnancy, fears/worries of parenthood, negatives of child care, parental stress
- **Items:** CBQ = multi-scale instrument; CMS = 47 items (26 positive + 21 negative); CBQ-SF = brief version validated on N=939 adults
- **Relevance:** Measures the "why" behind wanting another child. Ambivalent or primarily negative motivations are an important signal.
- **Source:** Miller (1995); Guedes et al. (2013) CMS; CBQ-SF Polish validation (2022)

### 12. Work-Family Conflict Scale (Carlson et al.)
- **What it measures:** Six dimensions: time-based, strain-based, and behavior-based conflict in both directions (work-to-family and family-to-work)
- **Items:** 18 items (3 per dimension)
- **Format:** Likert scale
- **Reliability:** Strong internal consistency; 6-factor structure stable across samples and gender
- **Relevance:** Work-life balance is a major practical concern. Parents already experiencing high work-to-family conflict will have that intensified by child #2.
- **Source:** Carlson, Kacmar & Williams (2000)

### 13. Tool to Measure Parenting Self-Efficacy (TOPSE)
- **What it measures:** Parenting self-efficacy across 8 domains: emotion/affection, play/enjoyment, empathy/understanding, control, discipline/boundaries, pressures of parenting, self-acceptance, learning/knowledge
- **Items:** 48 items (6 per domain)
- **Format:** 11-point Likert (0=completely disagree to 10=completely agree)
- **Reliability:** Subscale alpha .78-.90; overall .91
- **Target:** Parents of children 0-6 years
- **Relevance:** Granular self-efficacy data. A parent confident in emotion/affection but struggling with discipline/boundaries gets different advice than the reverse.
- **Source:** Kendall & Bloomfield (2005)

## Domains/Factors Identified

Synthesizing across the instruments and the transition-to-siblinghood literature (particularly Volling 2012, 2017), seven core domains emerge:

### 1. Emotional Bandwidth & Stress Load
- Current parental stress (PSI-4-SF)
- General life stress (PSS-10)
- Parental burnout symptoms (PBA)
- **Key question:** Do you have emotional reserves, or are you running on fumes?

### 2. Parenting Competence & Confidence
- Self-efficacy as a parent (PSOC, TOPSE)
- Sense of mastery vs. overwhelm with child #1
- **Key question:** Do you feel like you've "figured out" parenting enough to divide attention?

### 3. Relationship Quality & Partner Teamwork
- Relationship satisfaction (RAS, DAS-4)
- Dyadic coping under stress (DCI)
- Agreement on major decisions (DAS Consensus subscale)
- **Key question:** Is your relationship strong enough to survive the stress amplification of two kids?

### 4. Practical/Logistical Readiness
- Household chaos (CHAOS)
- Work-family conflict (Carlson WFC)
- Financial strain indicators
- Childcare and housing logistics
- **Key question:** Can your current household absorb another person, practically?

### 5. Social Support Infrastructure
- Perceived support from family, friends, partner (MSPSS)
- Availability of practical help (childcare backup, emergency support)
- **Key question:** Who will help you during the hardest months?

### 6. First Child Readiness & Developmental Factors
- First child's temperament and current adjustment (PSI Difficult Child subscale)
- Age/developmental stage of first child
- First child's attachment security
- **Key question:** Is your first child in a stable-enough phase to handle the disruption?
- **Research note:** Volling's work shows temperament, attachment security, and coparenting quality are the top pre-birth predictors of firstborn adjustment

### 7. Motivation & Values Alignment
- Positive vs. negative childbearing motivations (CBQ/CMS)
- Partner alignment on family size
- Clarity of desire vs. external pressure
- **Key question:** Is this want coming from YOU, or from timelines, grandparents, or social comparison?

## Item Types & Response Formats

Across the validated instruments, the most common formats:

| Format | Used by | Typical range |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Likert agreement (Strongly Disagree → Strongly Agree) | PSOC, MSPSS, TOPSE | 5-7 points |
| Likert frequency (Never → Very Often) | PSS-10, PBA, DCI | 5 points |
| Likert satisfaction (Low → High) | RAS, DAS | 5 points |
| True/False | CHAOS | Binary |
| Mixed formats | PSI-4-SF, DAS, FAD | Varies |

**For a quiz context:** 5-point Likert frequency or agreement scales are the most versatile and user-friendly. The CHAOS true/false format works for concrete logistical items. Avoid mixing too many formats.

## Key Items We Can Adapt

These are specific constructs (not copyrighted verbatim items) that map well to a second-child readiness quiz:

### From PSI-4-SF (Parental Distress domain)
- Feeling trapped by parenting responsibilities
- Loss of identity since becoming a parent
- Conflict between parenting and other life roles
- Feeling isolated or unsupported

### From PSOC (Efficacy subscale)
- Confidence in handling parenting problems
- Feeling like "I've got this" vs. constant doubt
- Ability to generate solutions when things go wrong

### From PBA (Exhaustion dimension)
- Feeling emotionally drained by parenting at end of day
- Contrast between current self and "the parent I thought I'd be"
- Feeling "on autopilot" with current child

### From RAS / DAS-4 (Relationship)
- Overall satisfaction with relationship
- Frequency of considering separation
- Degree of agreement on important decisions
- How much time spent doing things together

### From DCI (Dyadic Coping)
- When stressed, I tell my partner openly how I feel
- My partner helps me see stressful situations differently
- We cope with stress as a team

### From CHAOS (Household)
- Home feels like a zoo (noise, commotion)
- Can't find things when needed
- No regular routine / everything is last-minute
- Constant rushing

### From PSS-10 (General Stress)
- Feeling unable to control important things
- Feeling things are going your way (reverse)
- Difficulties piling up so high you can't overcome them

### From MSPSS (Support)
- There is a special person available when I need them
- My family is willing to help me make decisions
- I can count on my friends when things go wrong

### From CBQ (Motivations)
- Desire to experience pregnancy/infancy again
- Fear of parenting stress increasing
- Feeling of family being "complete" vs. "something missing"
- External pressure from family or social expectations

### From Carlson WFC (Work-Life)
- Work demands making it hard to be present at home
- Parenting stress spilling into work performance
- Not enough hours in the day for both roles

### First Child Factors (from Volling research)
- First child's general temperament (easy vs. challenging)
- First child's current sleep stability
- First child's ability to tolerate parental attention being divided (e.g., reactions when parent holds another baby)
- Age/developmental milestones of first child

## Gaps

### No dedicated "second child readiness" instrument exists
The literature search confirmed that no validated, published psychometric instrument specifically measures readiness to have a second child. This is a composite construct that must be assembled from adjacent domains.

### Under-measured constructs
1. **Financial readiness for family expansion** — no validated self-report scale. Research confirms financial stability is a top concern (especially for fathers), but measurement relies on objective indicators (income, savings) or single-item self-reports.
2. **Physical/health readiness** — medical literature focuses on interpregnancy interval (WHO recommends 24+ months between pregnancies, 33+ months between births) but no self-report psychometric for physical recovery readiness.
3. **First child's specific readiness** — Volling's research identifies predictors (temperament, attachment, coparenting) but these are assessed via clinical observation or parent-report behavioral checklists (CBCL), not brief self-screening items.
4. **Career/identity readiness** — work-family conflict scales exist but don't capture the specific "I just got back on track professionally" concern that many parents considering #2 report.
5. **Grief/loss processing** — no instrument addresses readiness after previous pregnancy loss, which changes the emotional calculus substantially.
6. **Age-of-first-child optimal window** — research suggests 2-3 year spacing is ideal, but this is a demographic variable, not a psychometric one.

## Recommended Approach

### Architecture: Composite assessment across 6-7 adapted domains

Since no single instrument exists, build a composite quiz drawing from the strongest, most relevant validated constructs. Recommended structure:

**Domain 1: Emotional Reserves (adapt from PSI-4-SF Parental Distress + PBA)**
- 3-4 items measuring current stress/burnout level
- Red flag: already burned out = strong "not yet" signal

**Domain 2: Parenting Confidence (adapt from PSOC Efficacy)**
- 2-3 items measuring mastery with current child
- Signal: "I feel like I know what I'm doing" vs. "I'm still figuring it out"

**Domain 3: Relationship Strength (adapt from RAS + DCI)**
- 3-4 items measuring satisfaction + stress-coping teamwork
- Red flag: relationship already strained = amplification risk

**Domain 4: Practical Capacity (adapt from CHAOS + Carlson WFC)**
- 3-4 items measuring household order + work-life balance
- Concrete, less emotional — "can your life absorb this logistically?"

**Domain 5: Support Network (adapt from MSPSS)**
- 2-3 items measuring available help from partner, family, friends
- Especially important: who will help in months 0-6?

**Domain 6: First Child Factors (adapt from Volling research + PSI Difficult Child)**
- 2-3 items on first child's temperament, age, current stability
- Research-informed: temperament is stronger predictor than age spacing

**Domain 7: Motivation Clarity (adapt from CBQ)**
- 2-3 items on why you want another child
- Internal desire vs. external pressure vs. timeline anxiety

### Total: ~20-25 items

This is enough to generate meaningful, domain-specific feedback while staying within a 5-7 minute completion window. Each domain gets its own "signal" (green/yellow/red) plus overall readiness profile.

### Scoring approach
- **Not a pass/fail** — this is a reflection tool, not a diagnostic
- **Domain-level feedback** — "Your relationship looks solid, but your stress levels suggest waiting until you have more support in place"
- **Weighted signals** — emotional bandwidth and relationship quality should carry more weight than logistics (you can buy help for logistics; you can't buy emotional reserves)
- Research suggests burnout (PBA) and relationship quality (DAS/RAS) are the two strongest predictors of post-second-birth family functioning

### Response format
- 5-point Likert agreement for most items (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
- True/False for concrete logistical items (CHAOS-style)
- Consider one open-ended prompt: "What's the main thing holding you back?" (not scored, but valuable for personalized feedback)
