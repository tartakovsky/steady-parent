# Child Emotional Intelligence -- Instrument Research

## Validated Instruments Found

### 1. EQ-i:YV (Emotional Quotient Inventory: Youth Version)
- **Author:** Bar-On & Parker (2000)
- **What it measures:** Overall emotional-social intelligence across five dimensions: Intrapersonal (self-awareness, emotional self-expression), Interpersonal (empathy, social responsibility, relationships), Stress Management (impulse control, flexibility under pressure), Adaptability (reality testing, problem-solving, flexibility), General Mood (optimism, happiness)
- **Items:** 60 items (full form); 30 items (short form EQ-i:YV[S])
- **Age range:** 7-18 years
- **Format:** Self-report; 4-point Likert ("very seldom true of me" to "very often true of me")
- **Notes:** Commercially licensed through MHS. Short form psychometrics are weaker -- confirmatory factor analysis shows the intended structure but limited predictive utility for mental health outcomes. Full form has robust five-factor structure and good internal consistency.

### 2. BRIEF-2 (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Second Edition)
- **Author:** Gioia, Isquith, Guy, & Kenworthy
- **What it measures:** Executive function including an Emotion Regulation Index comprising two subscales: Emotional Control (8 items -- ability to modulate emotional responses appropriately) and Shift (cognitive flexibility, transitioning between activities/mindsets)
- **Items:** 63 items total on Parent/Teacher forms; 55 items on Self-Report form. Emotion-relevant subscales are a subset.
- **Age range:** 5-18 years (parent/teacher forms); 11-18 years (self-report)
- **Format:** Parent-report, teacher-report, or self-report; frequency rating scale
- **Notes:** Commercially licensed through PAR. The Emotional Control subscale specifically targets emotion regulation in context of executive function. Not a pure EI measure but captures the self-regulation dimension well.

### 3. SDQ (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire)
- **Author:** Goodman (1997)
- **What it measures:** Five subscales: Emotional Symptoms (worry, fearfulness, somatic complaints, unhappiness, clinginess), Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity/Inattention, Peer Relationship Problems, and Prosocial Behavior (considerateness, sharing, helpfulness, kindness, volunteering)
- **Items:** 25 items total; 5 per subscale. Emotional Symptoms and Prosocial Behavior subscales (10 items combined) are EI-relevant.
- **Age range:** 4-17 years (parent/teacher versions); 11-17 years (self-report)
- **Format:** 3-point scale ("Not true," "Somewhat true," "Certainly true")
- **Notes:** Free to use, widely translated (80+ languages), massive normative base. Emotional Symptoms subscale validated specifically for depression/anxiety screening across development. Prosocial subscale captures empathy-in-action. Internal consistency for emotional symptoms alpha = 0.63-0.78; prosocial alpha = 0.59-0.87.

### 4. ACES (Assessment of Children's Emotion Skills)
- **Author:** Schultz, Izard, & Bear (2004)
- **What it measures:** Emotion recognition across three modalities: facial expressions (photos of happy, sad, mad, scared, neutral faces), behavioral descriptions (written scenarios depicting prototypical emotions), and situational vignettes (ambiguous situations, particularly sad/angry blends). Also detects anger attribution bias in aggressive children.
- **Items:** ~40 items across three subtests (facial expressions, behavioral descriptions, situational vignettes). Three items each for happiness, sadness, anger, fear plus ambiguous/mixed items.
- **Age range:** Elementary school, approximately grades 3-5 (ages 8-11 based on validation samples)
- **Format:** Direct child assessment (not self-report); PowerPoint-based facial expressions, read-aloud vignettes
- **Notes:** Free to download from UMBC Social Development Lab. Performance-based rather than self-report, which avoids social desirability bias. Cross-culturally validated (Korean, Spanish versions). Good for assessing emotion recognition specifically.

### 5. ERC (Emotion Regulation Checklist)
- **Author:** Shields & Cicchetti (1997)
- **What it measures:** Two subscales: Emotion Regulation (8 items -- emotional self-awareness, empathy, situationally appropriate displays) and Lability/Negativity (15 items -- reactivity, mood swings, inflexibility, irritability, dysregulated negative affect)
- **Items:** 24 items total
- **Age range:** Preschool through early school age (primarily validated 3-12)
- **Format:** Parent/teacher report; 4-point Likert ("never" to "almost always")
- **Notes:** Widely used in developmental research. Strong internal consistency (alpha 0.80-0.90 for both subscales). Sample items: "Is empathic toward others," "Can say when s/he is feeling sad, angry, or mad, fearful or afraid," "Exhibits wide mood swings," "Is prone to angry outbursts." Excellent for capturing the regulation dimension.

### 6. ERQ-CA (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents)
- **Author:** Gullone & Taffe (2012)
- **What it measures:** Two emotion regulation strategies: Cognitive Reappraisal (6 items -- changing how you think about a situation) and Expressive Suppression (4 items -- inhibiting outward emotional expression)
- **Items:** 10 items total
- **Age range:** 9-18 years (validated down to age 9)
- **Format:** Self-report; 5-point Likert
- **Notes:** Very brief. Good internal consistency (alpha = 0.76 for reappraisal, 0.77 for suppression). Stable over 12 months. Adapted from adult ERQ with simplified wording.
- **Source:** https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10862-025-10220-0

### 7. EmQue (Empathy Questionnaire)
- **Author:** Rieffe, Ketelaar, & Wiefferink (2010)
- **What it measures:** Three components of early empathy: Emotion Contagion (catching others' emotions), Attention to Others' Feelings, and Prosocial Actions
- **Items:** 16 items across three subscales
- **Age range:** 3-6 years (preschool)
- **Format:** Parent report
- **Notes:** Recently validated in German (2025) and Chinese (2024) versions. Three-factor structure confirmed. Internal consistency: EC alpha = 0.64, AOF alpha = 0.74, PA alpha = 0.78. Specifically designed for the youngest age group where self-report is not feasible.
- **Source:** https://db.arabpsychology.com/scales/empathy-questionnaire-emque/

### 8. ECIC (Emotional Competence in Children Scale)
- **Author:** Voltmer & von Salisch (2022)
- **What it measures:** Four components of emotional competence: Emotion Reasoning, Emotion Stability, Emotion Regulation, and Empathy
- **Items:** Not confirmed (likely 40-50 range based on four-factor structure)
- **Age range:** 3-12 years
- **Format:** Parent report
- **Notes:** Validated with N=695 caregivers. Grounded in a unifying framework of emotional competence rather than a single-construct model. Relatively new instrument.
- **Source:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362064771

### 9. ATEM 3-9 (Adaptive Test of Emotion Knowledge)
- **Author:** Voltmer et al. (German norming)
- **What it measures:** Seven components of emotion knowledge in young children, using adaptive testing (skip/dropout rules adjust to child's level)
- **Items:** Adaptive (varies per child)
- **Age range:** 3-9 years
- **Format:** Direct child assessment (performance-based)
- **Notes:** Normed on N=882 German children. Adaptive format is efficient and avoids floor/ceiling effects. Acceptable to good internal consistency across dimensions.
- **Source:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9304981/

### 10. Distress Tolerance / Frustration Tolerance Measures
- **DTS (Distress Tolerance Scale):** Self-report, validated for children with emotional disorders, sensitive to therapeutic change.
- **FISS (Frustration Intolerance Scale for Students):** Eight-plus-one factor model, specifically developed for children/adolescents. Confirmatory factor analysis validated.
- **DII-Y (Distress Intolerance Index for Youth):** Has both self-report (DII-Y) and parent-report (DII-Y-P) versions. Good-to-excellent internal consistency.
- **Source:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10814728/

### 11. KAIR (Kusche Affective Interview -- Revised)
- **Author:** Kusche (used in PATHS curriculum research)
- **What it measures:** Emotion vocabulary and emotion understanding at experiential and metacognitive levels. Children name all feeling words they know, then provide examples of experiencing 10 different emotions (5 basic: happy, sad, mad, scared, love; 5 advanced: proud, guilty, jealous, nervous, lonely).
- **Format:** Semi-structured interview; direct child assessment
- **Notes:** Qualitative/interview-based rather than scaled questionnaire. Assesses both breadth of emotion vocabulary and depth of emotional understanding. Used extensively in PATHS curriculum evaluation research.

## Domains/Factors Identified

Across all instruments, five core domains emerge consistently:

### 1. Emotion Recognition / Emotion Knowledge
- Identifying emotions in faces, body language, situations (ACES, ATEM)
- Understanding what causes emotions and what emotions mean (KAIR, ATEM)
- Distinguishing between similar emotions (e.g., sad vs. angry) (ACES ambiguous items)

### 2. Emotion Vocabulary / Emotional Awareness
- Labeling one's own emotions accurately (EQ-i:YV Intrapersonal, ERC, KAIR)
- Breadth of emotion words known (KAIR, CEVVT, EVER)
- Matching words to internal states (ERQ-CA awareness, DERS Clarity subscale)

### 3. Emotion Regulation / Self-Management
- Modulating emotional arousal appropriately to context (ERC Regulation subscale, BRIEF-2 Emotional Control)
- Cognitive reappraisal strategies (ERQ-CA Reappraisal)
- Impulse control under emotional arousal (EQ-i:YV Stress Management, BRIEF-2 Inhibit)
- Flexibility/adaptability when plans change (EQ-i:YV Adaptability, BRIEF-2 Shift)
- NOT suppressing emotions (ERQ-CA Suppression -- tracked as maladaptive)

### 4. Empathy / Social Awareness
- Emotion contagion (EmQue EC)
- Attention to others' feelings (EmQue AOF, EQ-i:YV Interpersonal)
- Perspective-taking (EQ-i:YV Interpersonal)
- Prosocial action in response to others' distress (SDQ Prosocial, EmQue PA, ERC empathy items)

### 5. Frustration Tolerance / Distress Tolerance
- Tolerating negative emotions without acting out (DTS, FISS, DII-Y)
- Emotional lability/negativity (ERC L/N subscale)
- Mood stability vs. wide mood swings (ECIC Emotion Stability)
- Recovery time after upset

---

## Item Types & Response Formats

### Self-Report (child completes)
- **Likert frequency/agreement:** "How often..." or "How true..." on 4-5 point scale (EQ-i:YV, ERQ-CA, DTS)
- **Best for:** Ages 9+ (literacy and self-awareness required)
- **Weakness:** Social desirability bias; young children lack metacognitive insight

### Parent/Caregiver Report
- **Likert frequency:** "Never / Sometimes / Often / Almost always" (ERC, BRIEF-2, EmQue)
- **Likert agreement:** "Not true / Somewhat true / Certainly true" (SDQ)
- **Best for:** All ages, especially under 8 where self-report is unreliable
- **Weakness:** Reflects parent's perception, not child's inner experience

### Performance-Based / Direct Assessment
- **Forced-choice emotion labeling:** Child picks emotion from options given a face/scenario (ACES, ATEM)
- **Open-ended interview:** Child generates emotion words and personal examples (KAIR)
- **Best for:** Emotion recognition and vocabulary; avoids self-report bias
- **Weakness:** Requires trained administrator; harder to scale

### Scenario/Vignette-Based
- **"What is this person feeling?"** -- child identifies emotion from behavioral description (ACES)
- **"What would you do if..."** -- hypothetical response to emotional situation
- **Best for:** Capturing applied emotional knowledge rather than abstract self-assessment

## Key Items We Can Adapt

### Emotion Vocabulary / Recognition
- "Tell me all the feeling words you know" (KAIR) -- could become: present a list of emotion words, parent rates which ones child uses spontaneously
- Scenario-based emotion identification: "A child's tower of blocks falls down right before they finish. How is the child feeling?" (adapted from ACES vignettes)
- Emotion granularity: Can child distinguish frustrated from angry? Disappointed from sad? Nervous from scared? (inspired by ACES ambiguous items and KAIR advanced emotions)

### Self-Awareness
- "My child can tell me when they are feeling sad, angry, or scared" (ERC item)
- "My child notices when their feelings change" (inspired by EQ-i:YV Intrapersonal)
- "My child knows what makes them upset" (inspired by DERS Awareness)

### Emotion Regulation
- "When my child gets upset, they can calm down without help" (adapted from ERC)
- "When something doesn't go as planned, my child can adjust" (adapted from EQ-i:YV Adaptability / BRIEF-2 Shift)
- "My child can wait for things they want without getting very upset" (adapted from BRIEF-2 Emotional Control)
- "When feeling bad, my child tries to think about it differently" (adapted from ERQ-CA Reappraisal)

### Empathy / Social Awareness
- "My child notices when someone else is sad or upset" (EmQue Attention to Others' Feelings)
- "My child tries to comfort someone who is hurt or crying" (SDQ Prosocial, EmQue Prosocial Actions)
- "My child considers how other people feel before acting" (EQ-i:YV Interpersonal)
- "My child shares with other children without being asked" (SDQ Prosocial)

### Frustration Tolerance / Emotional Lability
- "My child can handle it when things don't go their way" (adapted from DTS/FISS)
- "My child's moods change quickly" (ERC Lability/Negativity -- reverse scored)
- "My child has outbursts of anger that seem to come out of nowhere" (ERC Lability/Negativity -- reverse scored)
- "When frustrated, my child gives up easily" (adapted from BRIEF-2/FISS)

## Gaps

### 1. Age Range Fragmentation
No single instrument covers the full 3-18 range well for emotional intelligence holistically. Preschool (3-6) relies on parent report or performance tasks; school-age (7-12) can begin self-report; adolescent (13+) uses mature self-report. A quiz for a parenting blog needs to decide which age band to target or build age-branching logic.

### 2. No Standard "Child EI" Consensus Construct
Unlike adult EI (where Goleman's or Bar-On's models dominate), child EI measurement is fragmented across overlapping but distinct constructs: emotional competence, emotion knowledge, emotion regulation, social-emotional learning. There is no single gold-standard "child EI" assessment.

### 3. Self-Report Limitations Under Age 9
Most self-report EI instruments bottom out at age 7-9. For younger children, we are entirely dependent on parent observation, which measures different things (observable behavior vs. internal experience).

### 4. Cultural and Contextual Sensitivity
Most instruments were developed in Western (US/European) contexts. Emotion display rules, acceptable emotional expression, and empathy norms vary significantly across cultures. The SDQ has the broadest cross-cultural validation.

### 5. Frustration Tolerance Underdeveloped
Frustration tolerance is a dimension parents care about enormously (it maps to the "meltdown" concern), but validated child-specific measures are sparse and recent. The FISS (2025) is the most targeted but very new.

### 6. Emotion Vocabulary -- No Quick Parent-Report Version
The best emotion vocabulary measures (KAIR, ACES, ATEM) are performance-based and require direct child assessment. There is no validated short parent-report measure of "how many emotion words does your child understand and use."

### 7. Missing: Digital-Native Assessment Formats
All validated instruments use paper/interview formats. None are validated as web-based interactive quizzes, which is what we would be building. Any adaptation needs to acknowledge this gap.

## Recommended Approach

### Target: Parent-Report Quiz for Children Ages 3-12

Given that our audience is parents reading a parenting blog, the quiz should be:
- **Parent-report format** (not child self-report) -- parents are the quiz-takers
- **Brief** -- 15-25 items maximum for web completion
- **Age-branched or age-contextualized** -- item interpretation differs for a 4-year-old vs. an 11-year-old

### Proposed Domain Structure (5 domains, ~4 items each = 20 items)

1. **Emotion Vocabulary & Awareness** (~4 items)
   - Draw from: ERC self-awareness items, KAIR vocabulary concept, ECIC Emotion Reasoning
   - Example: "My child uses specific feeling words (like 'frustrated' or 'disappointed') rather than just 'bad' or 'sad'"

2. **Emotion Recognition** (~4 items)
   - Draw from: ACES concept (adapted to parent observation), EmQue Attention to Others' Feelings
   - Example: "My child can tell when I'm upset even if I haven't said anything"

3. **Emotion Regulation** (~4 items)
   - Draw from: ERC Regulation subscale, BRIEF-2 Emotional Control, ERQ-CA Reappraisal
   - Example: "When my child gets upset, they have strategies to calm themselves down"

4. **Empathy & Prosocial Behavior** (~4 items)
   - Draw from: SDQ Prosocial subscale, EmQue, EQ-i:YV Interpersonal
   - Example: "My child tries to help when someone is hurt or upset"

5. **Frustration Tolerance & Flexibility** (~4 items)
   - Draw from: ERC Lability/Negativity (reverse), BRIEF-2 Shift, DTS/FISS concepts
   - Example: "My child can handle disappointment without a major meltdown"

### Response Format
- 5-point frequency scale: "Almost never / Rarely / Sometimes / Often / Almost always"
- This matches the format used by ERC and BRIEF-2 and gives more discrimination than the SDQ's 3-point scale

### Age Contextualization
- Include a preliminary age-range selector (3-5, 6-8, 9-12)
- Scoring norms should shift by age band (a 3-year-old "sometimes" using feeling words is developmentally strong; a 10-year-old "sometimes" is a concern)
- Consider 1-2 items that swap wording based on age band

### Key Design Principles
- Items should describe observable behavior, not internal states (parent can observe "tries to comfort a friend" but cannot observe "feels empathy")
- Avoid pathologizing language -- frame as strengths/skills, not deficits
- Include both "high EI" indicators and "low EI" indicators (reverse-scored) to reduce acquiescence bias
- Keep items concrete and specific rather than abstract ("can name three feelings they had today" vs. "is emotionally intelligent")
