# Communication Safety — Instrument Research

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Purpose:** Identify validated psychometric instruments measuring parent-child communication safety and openness, to inform development of a Steady Parent quiz assessing whether a child feels safe to be honest, vulnerable, and emotionally open with their parent.

---

## Validated Instruments Found

### 1. Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale (PACS)
- **Authors:** Barnes & Olson (1985)
- **What it measures:** Quality of communication between parent and adolescent across two dimensions — openness (positive communication, empathy, trust, willingness to share) and problems (avoidance, defensiveness, verbal aggression, silent treatment)
- **Items:** 20 total (10 openness, 10 problems)
- **Format:** 5-point Likert scale; parent and child versions (identical items, different referents)
- **Reliability:** Openness alpha = .87, Problems alpha = .78; acceptable test-retest over 12 months
- **Notes:** The dominant instrument in the field — used in 75% of studies in the 2023 systematic review. Has been translated into 9+ languages. The "openness" subscale is closest to our construct of communication safety.

### 2. Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI)
- **Authors:** Parker, Tupling, & Brown (1979)
- **What it measures:** Retrospective perception of parenting received during first 16 years, along two orthogonal dimensions — Care (warmth, empathy, emotional availability) and Overprotection (restrictiveness, intrusion, discouragement of autonomy)
- **Items:** 25 (12 care, 13 overprotection)
- **Format:** 4-point Likert (0 = "very unlike" to 3 = "very like")
- **Reliability:** Care alpha = .80-.90, Overprotection alpha = .70-.85
- **Notes:** Creates four parenting quadrants (optimal, affectionate constraint, affectionless control, neglectful). The Care dimension captures emotional availability and warmth — relevant to safety. Overprotection dimension captures the control side that can undermine felt safety even with high warmth.

### 3. Revised Family Communication Patterns Instrument (RFCP)
- **Authors:** Ritchie & Fitzpatrick (1990)
- **What it measures:** Two dimensions of family communication norms — Conversation Orientation (15 items: openness to discussing diverse topics, free exchange of ideas) and Conformity Orientation (11 items: pressure to agree, defer to parental authority, maintain harmony)
- **Items:** 26 total
- **Format:** 7-point Likert (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
- **Reliability:** Conversation alpha = .93, Conformity alpha = .88
- **Notes:** Not designed to distinguish "healthy" vs "unhealthy" families — it describes communication patterns. The Conversation Orientation subscale captures the environment of openness. High-conformity/low-conversation families map to low communication safety.

### 4. Security Scale Questionnaire (SSQ)
- **Authors:** Kerns, Aspelmeier, Gentzler, & Grabill (2001)
- **What it measures:** Child's perceived attachment security — the degree to which the child believes the caregiver is responsive and available during stress (secure base and safe haven)
- **Items:** 15 (10 secure base support, 5 safe haven support); also 24-item version
- **Format:** "Harter" format — child chooses between two descriptions, then rates "sort of true" or "really true"
- **Reliability:** Test-retest r = .75 over ~14 days
- **Notes:** Validated for ages 9-12 and adolescents. Directly measures felt security — the closest existing construct to "communication safety." Predicts observed mother-adolescent interactions during conflict and social competence.

### 5. Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting Scale (IM-P)
- **Authors:** Duncan (2007); Duncan et al. (2009)
- **What it measures:** Five domains of mindful parenting: (a) Listening with Full Attention, (b) Emotional Awareness of Self and Child, (c) Self-Regulation in Parenting, (d) Non-Judgmental Acceptance of Self and Child, (e) Compassion for Self and Child
- **Items:** 31 (expanded from original 10)
- **Format:** 5-point Likert (1 = Never True to 5 = Always True); 14 items reverse coded
- **Reliability:** Dutch validation found 6-factor structure; English 5-factor structure not yet fully validated
- **Notes:** Parent self-report. The Non-Judgmental Acceptance and Listening with Full Attention subscales map directly to our construct. This is a parent-perspective measure of the behaviors that create communication safety.

### 6. Coping with Children's Negative Emotions Scale (CCNES)
- **Authors:** Fabes, Eisenberg, & Bernzweig (1990)
- **What it measures:** Parent responses to children's distress across 6 strategies — 3 supportive (Problem-Focused, Emotion-Focused, Expressive Encouragement) and 3 nonsupportive (Minimization, Punitive, Distress)
- **Items:** Scenario-based; each scenario rated on all 6 response types
- **Format:** Likert ratings per scenario; parent and child versions
- **Reliability:** Subscale alphas .69-.78; sound test-retest
- **Notes:** The Expressive Encouragement subscale (actively encouraging expression of negative emotions) and the nonsupportive subscales (dismissing, punishing, minimizing emotions) are the behavioral antecedents and antitheses of communication safety. Scenario-based format is powerful for a quiz.

### 7. Parent-Child Relationship Inventory (PCRI) — Communication Subscale
- **Authors:** Gerard (1994)
- **What it measures:** 7 dimensions of parenting including Communication — parent's perceived effectiveness of communication with child
- **Items:** 78 total; Communication subscale = 9 items
- **Format:** Self-report Likert
- **Reliability:** Communication subscale alpha .67-.74; test-retest .68
- **Notes:** Lower reliability than PACS. Primarily a parent self-report of perceived communication effectiveness, not the child's felt safety.

### 8. Perceptions of Parents Scale (POPS)
- **Authors:** Robbins (1994); based on Self-Determination Theory
- **What it measures:** Child's perception of parent on three SDT dimensions: Autonomy Support, Involvement, and Warmth — separately for mother and father
- **Items:** 42 (21 per parent)
- **Format:** Likert scale; child-report
- **Reliability:** Alpha .80-.90
- **Notes:** Autonomy support (feeling free to express oneself without controlling consequences) is a direct component of communication safety. Involvement captures "does this parent know what's going on in my life" — related to disclosure patterns.

### 9. Emotion-Related Parenting Styles Self-Test (ERPS)
- **Authors:** Gottman et al. (1997); short form by Hakim-Larson et al. (2006)
- **What it measures:** Parental meta-emotion philosophy: emotion coaching vs. emotion dismissing
- **Items:** Short form; 3-4 factors (emotion coaching, acceptance of negative emotion, rejection of negative emotion, uncertainty/ineffectiveness)
- **Format:** Likert self-report
- **Notes:** Derived from Gottman's Meta-Emotion Interview (45-90 min). The coaching vs. dismissing distinction maps directly to whether a child's emotional expression is met with acceptance or shutdown.

### 10. Child Disclosure Scale
- **Authors:** Stattin & Kerr (2000)
- **What it measures:** How often adolescents spontaneously disclose information to parents about school, friends, leisure
- **Items:** 3 (very brief)
- **Format:** Frequency-based self-report
- **Notes:** Measures the behavioral outcome of communication safety — voluntary disclosure. Short but validated. Related work differentiates autonomous vs. controlled disclosure motivation (Wuyts et al., 2018).

### 11. Parent-Child Communication Quality Scale (PCCQS)
- **Authors:** Developed in 2024, based on self psychology theory
- **What it measures:** Communication quality through children's psychological need fulfillment: Mirroring (self-esteem support), Idealization (security/comfort), Empathy, and Appropriate Response
- **Items:** 15
- **Format:** Child-report; second-order four-factor structure
- **Reliability:** Good construct/criterion validity, high internal consistency
- **Notes:** Very new (2024). Validated with Chinese urban children ages 8-12. The most theoretically aligned with communication safety as "do I feel met, understood, and safe" during parent-child communication.

### 12. Parent-Child Emotion Communication Questionnaire (PEC)
- **Authors:** Validated 2024
- **What it measures:** Extent to which parents appreciate emotions, discuss emotions with children, address impact of emotion expression on relationships
- **Items:** Short form
- **Format:** Parent self-report
- **Notes:** Recent measure focusing specifically on emotional communication — how much emotions are named, discussed, and validated in the household.

## Domains/Factors Identified

Synthesizing across all instruments, parent-child communication safety maps to these core domains:

### Domain 1: Openness & Willingness to Share
- PACS Openness subscale: trust, ease of expression, willingness to share beliefs
- RFCP Conversation Orientation: free exchange of ideas and feelings
- Child Disclosure Scale: spontaneous information sharing
- POPS Autonomy Support: feeling free to express without controlling consequences

### Domain 2: Non-Judgmental Responsiveness
- IM-P Non-Judgmental Acceptance subscale: acceptance without criticism
- CCNES Expressive Encouragement: encouraging emotional expression
- CCNES (absence of) Minimization/Punitive: not dismissing or punishing emotions
- ERPS Emotion Coaching: meeting emotions with curiosity not shutdown
- PBI Care dimension: warmth, empathy, emotional availability

### Domain 3: Emotional Safety & Felt Security
- SSQ: child believes caregiver is available and responsive during stress
- PBI Care: perception of warmth and empathy
- PCCQS Idealization factor: feeling linked to parent in a way that meets needs for security and comfort
- PCCQS Empathy factor: parent gathers information and responds appropriately

### Domain 4: Repair After Conflict
- PACS Problems subscale (reverse): avoidance, defensiveness, silent treatment
- No dedicated validated instrument exists for parent-child conflict repair specifically
- Conflict Resolution Scale (CPS) exists but measures interparental conflict, not parent-child
- This is a significant gap in the literature

### Domain 5: Absence of Communication-Killing Behaviors
- PACS Problems subscale: verbal aggression, insults, nagging
- CCNES Punitive: punishment for emotional expression
- CCNES Minimization: discounting/devaluing emotions
- RFCP Conformity Orientation: pressure to agree, suppress dissent
- PBI Overprotection: control and intrusion that suppress authentic expression

### Domain 6: Vulnerability Comfort
- SSQ: willingness to approach caregiver during distress
- Child Disclosure Scale: spontaneous sharing (behavioral indicator)
- Autonomous vs. controlled disclosure (Wuyts et al., 2018): sharing because you want to, not because you fear consequences of not sharing
- IM-P Listening with Full Attention: child feels truly heard

## Item Types & Response Formats

| Format | Example Instrument | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| Likert agreement (5-7pt) | PACS, RFCP, IM-P | Simple, fast, well-validated | Social desirability bias; abstract |
| Frequency (never-always) | Child Disclosure Scale, IM-P | Concrete, behavioral | May miss quality of interaction |
| Scenario-based | CCNES | Reduces social desirability; feels realistic | Longer; harder to score simply |
| Harter "which child are you like" | SSQ | Reduces acquiescence bias | Unusual format; harder to administer online |
| Retrospective (first 16 years) | PBI | Captures stable patterns | Not useful for current parenting assessment |

**For a quiz:** Likert frequency items ("How often...") and scenario items ("When your child comes to you upset about something at school, you typically...") are the strongest combination. Scenario items are gold for communication safety because they bypass "I'm a great communicator" self-serving bias.

## Key Items We Can Adapt

### From PACS (Openness subscale) — reframe as parent self-assessment:
- "My child can discuss beliefs with me without feeling embarrassed" --> "When my child shares an opinion I disagree with, I listen without correcting them"
- "I am a good listener" --> "My child would say I really listen when they talk to me"
- "I am very satisfied with how we talk together" --> "I feel good about how my child and I communicate about hard topics"

### From CCNES — scenario format:
- When your child is upset about something that happened with a friend, you typically: (a) help them figure out what to do, (b) comfort them, (c) say "it's not a big deal," (d) feel annoyed they're upset, (e) encourage them to tell you more about how they feel
- This maps directly to coaching vs. dismissing

### From IM-P — non-judgmental acceptance:
- "When my child does something I disapprove of, I react calmly" (self-regulation)
- "I listen carefully to my child's ideas even when I disagree" (non-judgmental listening)
- "I notice when my child's feelings change" (emotional awareness)

### From SSQ — reframe for parent:
- "My child comes to me when they're upset" (safe haven)
- "My child tells me about problems without me having to ask" (secure base → voluntary disclosure)

### From Child Disclosure research:
- "My child spontaneously tells me about their day" (autonomous disclosure)
- "My child tells me things because they want to, not because I ask" (intrinsic motivation to share)

### From RFCP — conversation orientation:
- "In our family, we talk about feelings openly"
- "I encourage my child to express their own opinions, even if they differ from mine"

### Repair items (novel — no validated source):
- "After an argument with my child, I go back and talk about what happened"
- "I apologize to my child when I've overreacted"
- "My child and I can move past disagreements without lingering tension"

## Gaps

### 1. Conflict Repair (Major Gap)
No validated parent-child instrument specifically measures repair after rupture. The Conflict Resolution Scale (CPS) focuses on interparental conflict. The concept of "repair" comes from attachment theory (Tronick's "still face" paradigm, Bowlby) and Gottman's relationship repair research, but these are primarily observational, not self-report. This is a domain we must construct novel items for.

### 2. Parent Self-Report vs. Child Report
Most validated measures are either child-report (PACS, SSQ, POPS, PCCQS) or observational (EA Scales). Our quiz is parent self-report. The IM-P and CCNES are parent-report, but most communication safety instruments assume the child is the reporter. This means we need to carefully reframe: asking parents about observable behaviors and child responses, not just their intentions.

### 3. Age Range Gaps
- SSQ validated for 9-12 and adolescents
- PACS validated for adolescents (not young children)
- PCCQS validated for 8-12
- No single instrument spans toddler-to-teen. Our quiz likely needs to be age-neutral in framing or age-branched.

### 4. Cultural Validation
Most instruments validated primarily in Western, English-speaking populations. PCCQS was validated in China. PBI has broad international validation. Communication safety norms vary significantly by culture.

### 5. Disclosure Motivation
The Child Disclosure Scale measures frequency but not the why. Wuyts et al. (2018) distinguish autonomous ("I want to share") from controlled ("I have to or I'll get in trouble") disclosure, but this is not yet a widely validated standalone measure.

### 6. Digital/Modern Communication
No instrument captures modern communication dynamics — texting, social media, screen-mediated interaction. All instruments assume face-to-face communication contexts.

## Recommended Approach

### Construct Definition
**Communication Safety:** The degree to which a child feels free to be honest, express difficult emotions, share mistakes, disagree, and be vulnerable with their parent — and trusts that doing so will be met with listening, understanding, and connection rather than judgment, dismissal, punishment, or withdrawal.

### Quiz Architecture
Build around **4 scored domains** (derived from factor analysis across instruments):

1. **Emotional Welcome** (child's emotions are received, not shut down)
   - Draw from: CCNES Expressive Encouragement, IM-P Non-Judgmental Acceptance, ERPS Emotion Coaching
   - Mix of Likert + 1-2 scenario items

2. **Openness Climate** (child freely shares without prompting)
   - Draw from: PACS Openness, RFCP Conversation Orientation, Child Disclosure, POPS Autonomy Support
   - Likert frequency items

3. **Rupture Repair** (conflict doesn't damage connection long-term)
   - Novel items (no validated source) — construct from attachment theory + Gottman repair research
   - Scenario items preferred (harder to fake)

4. **Vulnerability Comfort** (child brings hard stuff — mistakes, fears, shame)
   - Draw from: SSQ safe haven items, PACS trust items, PCCQS security/empathy factors
   - Likert agreement items + 1 scenario

### Item Format
- **10-14 items total** (quiz, not clinical instrument — must be completable in 2-3 minutes)
- Mix of **Likert frequency** ("How often does your child...") and **scenario-based** ("When your child messes up at school, your first response is usually...")
- **5-point scale** for Likert items (standard, maps to PACS/IM-P norms)
- **Parent self-report** with behavioral anchoring (ask about observable actions, not beliefs about yourself)
- Frame items as what actually happens, not what the parent wishes happened

### Scoring
- Continuous score per domain, mapped to 3-4 interpretive bands
- No clinical cutoffs (we are not diagnosing) — frame as "strengths and growth areas"
- Weight scenario items slightly higher (less susceptible to social desirability bias)

### Validation Strategy
- Face validity: Review by 2-3 family therapists / parenting researchers
- Internal consistency: Target alpha > .75 per subscale
- Convergent validity: Correlate with PACS openness subscale if possible in pilot
- Discriminant validity: Should not simply replicate general parenting warmth (PBI Care) — must capture the specific communication-safety construct
