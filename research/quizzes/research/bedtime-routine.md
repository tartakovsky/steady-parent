  6. Calming activities with child before bed (10 pts)
- **Two measurement modes:**
  - Static (BTR-Index S): One-off snapshot, score out of 100
  - Dynamic (BTR-Index D): 7-night diary, score out of 100 based on nightly adherence
- **Status:** Expert consensus (59 experts, 4-round Delphi) but limited psychometric validation. Most directly relevant to "bedtime routine" as a construct.

## Domains/Factors Identified

Synthesizing across all instruments, the following domains emerge for a bedtime routine / sleep hygiene assessment:

| Domain | Source Instruments | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Schedule Consistency** | BEARS-R, ASHSr, PSPQ, BTR-Index | Same bedtime/wake time across weekdays and weekends |
| **Bedtime Routine Structure** | PSPQ, BTR-Index, Mindell research | Consistent sequence of calming pre-sleep activities |
| **Bedtime Resistance / Cooperation** | CSHQ, BEARS-B | Child's willingness to go to bed; struggles, stalling, protests |
| **Sleep Environment** | ASHSr, PSPQ, CRSP | Room darkness, temperature, noise level, comfort, safety objects |
| **Screen/Technology Use** | CRSP, ASHSr, PSPQ, BTR-Index | Device exposure in the hour before bed; devices in bedroom |
| **Physiological Factors** | ASHSr | Caffeine, heavy food, vigorous exercise near bedtime |
| **Sleep Onset Independence** | BISQ-R (PB), PSPQ | Whether child can fall asleep without parental presence |
| **Calming vs. Activating Activities** | BTR-Index, ASHSr, CRSP | Reading/bath/songs vs. roughhousing/exciting play/scary content |
| **Cognitive/Emotional Arousal** | ASHSr | Worries, racing thoughts, fears at bedtime |
| **Sleep Anxiety** | CSHQ | Fear of dark, afraid to sleep alone, needs parent nearby |

## Item Types & Response Formats

### Frequency-based (most common)
- **3-point:** Usually / Sometimes / Rarely (CSHQ — anchored to nights per week: 5-7, 2-4, 0-1)
- **5-point:** Never / Almost never / Sometimes / Almost always / Always (CRSP)
- **5-point frequency:** Never / 1-2x month / 1-2x week / 3-5x week / Always (SDSC)

### Agreement-based
- **6-point:** Strongly disagree to Strongly agree (ASHSr)

### Behavior-specific
- **Nights per week:** "How many nights per week does your child..." (0-7 scale)
- **Yes/No + frequency:** "Does your child have a bedtime routine? If yes, how many nights per week?"

### Time-based
- **Clock times:** "What time does your child go to bed on school nights?" / "...on weekends?"
- **Duration:** "How long does the bedtime routine take?" (minutes)

### Recall period
- Most instruments use **"a typical week"** or **"the past week"** as the reference frame
- SDSC uses "past 6 months" (too long for routine assessment)
- BTR-Index (D) uses a 7-night prospective diary

**Best fit for a parent-facing quiz:** 3-point or 5-point frequency scale anchored to nights per week. The CSHQ's 3-point is simplest for a quick quiz; the CRSP's 5-point gives more granularity.

## Key Items We Can Adapt

These are specific, evidence-backed item themes drawn from validated instruments that can be adapted for a bedtime routine self-assessment quiz:

### Schedule Consistency
- Child goes to bed at the same time on school nights (CSHQ, BEARS-R, PSPQ)
- Child goes to bed at the same time on weekends vs. school nights (ASHSr — sleep stability)
- Child wakes up at the same time each morning (ASHSr)

### Routine Structure & Activities
- Child follows the same bedtime routine each night (PSPQ, BTR-Index)
- Routine includes calming activities like reading, bath, or quiet play (BTR-Index, Mindell)
- Routine includes oral hygiene / brushing teeth (BTR-Index — highest weighted component)
- Routine has a clear, predictable sequence the child knows (Mindell research)
- Routine lasts approximately 20-30 minutes (Mindell research)

### Bedtime Resistance & Cooperation
- Child goes to bed willingly (CSHQ — bedtime resistance)
- Child struggles at bedtime / needs repeated reminders (CSHQ)
- Child stalls or finds reasons to delay (CSHQ — "needs something else before going to bed")
- Child argues about bedtime (CSHQ)

### Screen / Technology
- Child uses screens (TV, tablet, phone) within 1 hour of bedtime (CRSP, PSPQ, ASHSr)
- Electronic devices are present in the child's bedroom at night (CRSP, ASHSr)
- Child watches exciting or scary content before bed (ASHSr — behavioral arousal)

### Sleep Environment
- Child's room is dark enough for sleep (ASHSr, PSPQ)
- Child's room is quiet (ASHSr)
- Child's room is a comfortable temperature (ASHSr)
- Child sleeps in their own bed / designated sleep space (CRSP — sleep location)

### Sleep Onset Independence
- Child falls asleep independently (without parent in room) (BISQ-R PB, PSPQ)
- Child needs parent to lie down with them (CSHQ — sleep anxiety)
- Child needs a light on to fall asleep (CSHQ)

### Physiological
- Child avoids caffeine (soda, chocolate) in the afternoon/evening (ASHSr, CRSP, BTR-Index)
- Child avoids heavy meals close to bedtime (ASHSr, BTR-Index)
- Child avoids vigorous physical activity in the hour before bed (ASHSr)

### Emotional/Cognitive Readiness
- Child worries or has racing thoughts at bedtime (ASHSr — cognitive/emotional)
- Child is afraid of the dark or of sleeping alone (CSHQ — sleep anxiety)
- Child seems wound up or overstimulated at bedtime (ASHSr — behavioral arousal)

## Gaps

### No single validated instrument measures "bedtime routine quality" as a unified construct
- The CSHQ measures sleep problems (pathology-oriented), not routine quality
- The BEARS is a screening framework, not a scored questionnaire
- The BTR-Index (Delphi) is the closest but has limited psychometric validation — it is a consensus-based index, not a factor-analyzed scale
- The PSPQ targets practices but is youth self-report (ages 8-17), not parent-report for younger children
- The ASHSr is well-validated for hygiene but only covers adolescents

### Age gaps
- Ages 2-4 (toddler): Only BISQ-R and BTR-Index cover this range; CSHQ starts at 4
- Ages 4-7 (preschool/early school): CSHQ covers this but has no dedicated "routine quality" subscale
- The most relevant "routine" research (Mindell) targets ages 0-5 but produced no scored questionnaire

### Missing from existing instruments
- **Parent's own bedtime behavior modeling** — no instrument measures whether parents model good sleep habits
- **Transition warnings / wind-down cues** — research supports giving children advance notice ("10 minutes until bedtime") but no instrument measures this
- **Routine flexibility vs. rigidity** — overly rigid routines can be problematic too (anxiety-driven rituals), but no instrument captures this nuance
- **Cultural variation** — BTR-Index Delphi is the only instrument that explicitly considered cross-cultural applicability
- **Weekend vs. weekday differential** — ASHSr captures this for teens; no validated measure for younger children
- **Parent emotional state during routine** — Mindell's research shows maternal mood improves with bedtime routines, but no instrument measures parent frustration/calm during the routine itself

### Response format limitations
- CSHQ's 3-point scale (rarely/sometimes/usually) is coarse — it collapses "3 nights" and "6 nights" into the same bucket
- Most instruments were designed for clinical screening, not for self-guided reflection or improvement tracking

## Recommended Approach

### Target Construct
**"Bedtime routine quality and sleep hygiene practices"** — a modifiable-behavior-focused assessment rather than a sleep disorder screener. The quiz should measure what parents DO (practices) rather than what's WRONG (pathology).

### Recommended Domains (6)
Drawing primarily from the PSPQ structure, ASHSr domains, and BTR-Index components:

1. **Routine Consistency** (schedule regularity + nightly routine adherence)
   - Sources: PSPQ, ASHSr (sleep stability), BTR-Index, BEARS-R
2. **Routine Activities** (calming sequence: bath, brush, book, bed + duration)
   - Sources: BTR-Index (Delphi consensus), Mindell research
3. **Screen & Stimulation Management** (tech cutoff, exciting activities, cognitive wind-down)
   - Sources: CRSP, ASHSr (behavioral arousal), PSPQ
4. **Sleep Environment** (dark, cool, quiet, own bed)
   - Sources: ASHSr, PSPQ
5. **Bedtime Cooperation** (child goes willingly, minimal resistance/stalling)
   - Sources: CSHQ (bedtime resistance), BEARS-B
6. **Sleep Onset Independence** (falls asleep without parent, self-soothes)
   - Sources: BISQ-R (parent behavior), PSPQ, CSHQ (sleep anxiety)

### Recommended Response Format
- **5-point frequency scale:** Never (0 nights) / Rarely (1-2 nights) / Sometimes (3-4 nights) / Usually (5-6 nights) / Always (7 nights)
- This aligns with CRSP's validated format and is more granular than CSHQ's 3-point scale
- Recall period: "In a typical week"
- Some items can be reverse-scored (screen use, stimulating activities = higher frequency is worse)

### Item Count
- Target 12-15 items (2-3 per domain)
- Short enough for a blog quiz (~3-4 minutes) while covering all 6 domains
- Modeled on the PSPQ's 15-item structure

### Scoring Approach
- Sum score per domain + total score
- Percentile-based or threshold-based interpretation (e.g., "strong routine" / "room to improve" / "worth addressing")
- NOT clinical — frame as "how your routine stacks up against what research supports," not as diagnosis

### Key Design Principles
1. **Strengths-based framing** — ask about positive behaviors ("We follow the same routine each night") rather than deficits ("My child resists bedtime")
2. **Actionable** — every item should correspond to a concrete, modifiable behavior a parent can change
3. **Age-appropriate interpretation** — note that sleep onset independence expectations differ by age (a 2-year-old needing a parent nearby is normal; an 8-year-old may need support building independence)
4. **Avoid pathologizing** — this is not a clinical screener; avoid items about parasomnias, sleep-disordered breathing, or restless legs
