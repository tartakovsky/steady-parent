# Sleepover Readiness — Instrument Research

## Validated Instruments Found

### 1. SCARED — Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders
- **What it measures:** Child anxiety across 5 domains. The Separation Anxiety subscale is directly relevant.
- **Items:** 41 total. Separation Anxiety subscale = 8 items (items 4, 8, 13, 16, 20, 25, 29, 31). Separation anxiety cutoff >= 5.
- **Age range:** 8–18 years (child self-report); parent version also available
- **Response format:** 3-point scale (0 = Not True or Hardly Ever True / 1 = Somewhat or Sometimes True / 2 = Very True or Often True)
- **Reliability:** Good internal consistency and test-retest reliability; discriminative validity well-established
- **Availability:** FREE. Public domain. Available from University of Pittsburgh (Birmaher et al., 1997).
- **Item themes (separation subscale):** Fear of sleeping away from home, worry about bad things happening to parents, reluctance to be away from family, nightmares about separation, following parents around the house, physical symptoms when separating, distress when apart.
- **Most relevant for us:** The 8 separation anxiety items directly tap the core fear underlying sleepover reluctance. The 3-point response scale is very simple.

### 2. SCAS — Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (Separation Anxiety subscale)
- **What it measures:** Anxiety symptoms across 6 subscales. Separation Anxiety subscale measures distress when separated from caregivers or home.
- **Items:** 44 total (38 scored + 6 filler). Separation Anxiety = 6 items (items 5, 8, 11, 14, 15, 38).
- **Age range:** 8–15 years (child self-report); parent version (SCAS-P) also available
- **Response format:** 4-point frequency scale (0 = Never / 1 = Sometimes / 2 = Often / 3 = Always)
- **Reliability:** Percentile norms based on N=4,916. 85th percentile = clinically relevant.
- **Availability:** FREE. Available at scaswebsite.com. Translated into many languages.
- **Separation subscale themes:** Fears about being alone, worry about harm befalling family, reluctance to sleep away from home.
- **Most relevant for us:** Slightly broader anxiety framing than SCARED. The 4-point frequency scale maps better to our typical quiz response formats.

### 3. CSAS — Children's Separation Anxiety Scale
- **What it measures:** Separation anxiety specifically, via 4 factors covering cognitive, physiological, behavioral, and positive components.
- **Items:** 20 items, 5 per factor
- **Subscales:** (1) Worry about Separation — cognitive component; (2) Distress from Separation — psychophysiological component; (3) Opposition to Separation — behavioral component; (4) Calm at Separation — positive/confidence component (reverse-scored).
- **Age range:** 8–11 years. Validated with N=1,908 (Study 1) and N=6,016 (Study 2).
- **Response format:** 5-point frequency scale (1 = Never or Almost Never → 5 = Always or Almost Always)
- **Reliability:** alpha = .82 total; .83 (Worry), .76 (Distress), .72 (Opposition), .75 (Calm). Diagnostic cutoff of 68: sensitivity 85%, specificity 95%.
- **Example items:** "Do you worry about something bad happening to your mom or dad?"; "Do you feel like crying when your mom or dad drops you off at school?"; "Are you calm when your mom or dad isn't with you?"
- **Parent version (CSAS-P):** Also validated (Frontiers in Psychology, 2022).
- **Most relevant for us:** The 4-factor structure is gold — it separates cognitive worry, physical distress, behavioral resistance, and calm/confidence. The "Calm at Separation" factor is exactly a readiness signal, not just absence of anxiety.

### 4. SAAS — Separation Anxiety Assessment Scale
- **What it measures:** Separation anxiety disorder symptoms via 4 symptom dimensions + safety signals.
- **Items:** 34 total. 5 items per symptom dimension + 9-item safety signals index + frequency of calamitous events.
- **Subscales:** (1) Fear of Being Alone (5 items); (2) Fear of Abandonment (5 items); (3) Fear of Physical Illness / Somatic Complaints (5 items); (4) Worry about Calamitous Events (5 items); (5) Safety Signals Index (9 items).
- **Age range:** 8–11 years
- **Response format:** 4-point scale (1 = Never / 2 = Sometimes / 3 = Most of the time / 4 = All the time)
- **Reliability:** alpha = .84, temporal stability r = .77. Sensitivity 83%, specificity 93%.
- **Parent version (SAAS-P):** Validated (alpha = .84, r = .75, sensitivity 90%, specificity 82%).
- **Most relevant for us:** "Fear of Being Alone" and "Fear of Abandonment" subscales are highly relevant to sleepover anxiety. Safety Signals Index is interesting — it measures what/who the child needs nearby to feel safe.

### 5. NFS — Nighttime Fears Scale
- **What it measures:** Fear-provoking stimuli at nighttime in children.
- **Items:** 21 items across 4 factors.
- **Subscales:** (1) Nighttime Features and Distressing Experiences; (2) Fear of Loss or Separation from Family; (3) Fear of Imaginary Stimuli; (4) Fear of Real Stimuli.
- **Age range:** 8–12 years (self-report)
- **Response format:** Self-report standardized scale
- **Reliability:** Strong internal consistency (alpha .87–.94), adequate test-retest reliability.
- **Parent version (NFS-P):** Validated for children aged 3–8 years (Orgiles, 2024).
- **Most relevant for us:** "Fear of Loss or Separation from Family" and "Nighttime Features" subscales directly map to the sleeping-in-unfamiliar-place dimension of sleepovers.

### 6. FAWN-YC — Fears and Worries at Nighttime—Young Children
- **What it measures:** Nighttime fears in young children via parent report.
- **Items:** 17 items across 3 factors.
- **Subscales:** (1) Nighttime Fear Focus (8 items, alpha = .92); (2) Bedtime/Sleep Avoidance and Interference (5 items, alpha = .90); (3) Dark Fear (4 items, alpha = .88).
- **Age range:** 3–5 years (parent report)
- **Reliability:** Excellent internal consistency across all subscales.
- **Most relevant for us:** Useful for the younger end of our audience. "Dark Fear" and "Bedtime/Sleep Avoidance" factors capture nighttime comfort.

### 7. ERC — Emotion Regulation Checklist
- **What it measures:** Children's emotion regulation capacities via caregiver report.
- **Items:** 24 items across 2 subscales.
- **Subscales:** (1) Lability/Negativity (15 items) — lack of flexibility, anger dysregulation, mood lability; (2) Emotion Regulation (8 items) — appropriate emotional displays, empathy, self-awareness.
- **Age range:** Preschool through elementary (no strict age bounds)
- **Response format:** 4-point Likert scale
- **Reliability:** alpha .83 (ER subscale), .96 (L/N subscale). Shields & Cicchetti, 1997.
- **Availability:** Widely used in research. Published items available.
- **Most relevant for us:** The Emotion Regulation subscale captures a child's capacity to manage emotional responses — critical for handling unexpected discomfort at a sleepover.

### 8. Vineland-3 — Adaptive Behavior Scales (Daily Living Skills domain)
- **What it measures:** Adaptive behavior across Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, Motor Skills.
- **Daily Living Skills subdomains:** (1) Personal — eating, dressing, washing, hygiene; (2) Domestic — household tasks; (3) Community — safety, travel, etc.
- **Items:** Comprehensive; items ordered developmentally.
- **Response format:** 3-point (0 = Never / 1 = Sometimes or partly / 2 = Usually or habitually)
- **Age range:** 0–90 years
- **Publisher:** Pearson. Proprietary.
- **Most relevant for us:** The Personal (self-care) subdomain items for the 5–10 age range map directly to sleepover self-care skills: brushing teeth, pajamas, toileting, basic hygiene without help.

### 9. CSPI — Children's Self-Efficacy for Peer Interaction Scale
- **What it measures:** Children's perceptions of their ability to enact prosocial verbal persuasive skills with peers.
- **Items:** 22 items. 12 conflict situations, 10 non-conflict situations.
- **Age range:** Grades 3–4 (approx. ages 8–10)
- **Response format:** 4-point Likert scale
- **Developer:** Wheeler & Ladd, 1982
- **Availability:** Open access (Developmental Psychology)
- **Most relevant for us:** Conflict-situation items capture whether a child can assert needs and navigate disagreements with peers — essential at a sleepover when parents aren't there to mediate.

### 10. CABS — Children's Assertive Behavior Scale
- **What it measures:** Social skills and assertiveness across many problematic social situations.
- **Items:** 27 items, each with 5 response alternatives (ranging from highly inhibited to aggressive).
- **Situations covered:** Making/receiving compliments, presenting/accepting criticisms, asking for help, giving things, providing help, initiating conversations, behavior before orders.
- **Age range:** Elementary school
- **Reliability:** Good concurrent validity with peer, parent, and teacher measures of social competency.
- **Most relevant for us:** "Asking for help" and "behavior before orders" situations directly map to whether a child can ask a host parent for what they need.

## Domains/Factors Identified

From the validated instruments and clinical literature, the following domains emerge as components of sleepover readiness:

### Domain 1: Separation Comfort
*"Can my child handle being away from me overnight?"*
- Worry/catastrophizing about being apart (CSAS Factor 1, SAAS "Worry about Calamitous Events")
- Physical distress symptoms when separating (CSAS Factor 2, SCARED somatic items)
- Behavioral resistance to separation (CSAS Factor 3)
- Confidence/calm when apart (CSAS Factor 4 — the positive pole)
- Fear of abandonment (SAAS subscale)
- Fear of being alone (SAAS subscale)
- **Key insight from CSAS:** Readiness isn't just absence of anxiety — the "Calm at Separation" factor captures positive confidence, which is what we actually want to measure.

### Domain 2: Nighttime Comfort
*"Can my child sleep in an unfamiliar place?"*
- Fear of darkness (NFS, FAWN-YC "Dark Fear")
- Fear of imaginary stimuli — monsters, ghosts (NFS subscale)
- Fear of nighttime separation from family (NFS subscale)
- Bedtime avoidance behaviors (FAWN-YC)
- Nightmare frequency and distress (SCARED items, NFS)
- Ability to fall asleep independently (clinical literature)

### Domain 3: Self-Care Independence
*"Can my child handle bedtime and morning routines without me?"*
- Bedtime routine: brushing teeth, changing into pajamas (Vineland Personal, Understood.org checklist)
- Toileting independence including nighttime (Nationwide Children's Hospital)
- Basic hygiene without adult prompting (Vineland Personal)
- Managing personal belongings (packing, keeping track of things)
- Food/eating flexibility — handling unfamiliar meals (clinical literature)
- **Key insight:** This is the most "objective" domain — either a child can do these things or they can't. Less psychological, more practical skills.

### Domain 4: Communication & Help-Seeking
*"Can my child ask another adult for what they need?"*
- Willingness to approach non-parent adults for help (Understood.org checklist, CABS)
- Assertiveness in expressing needs (CABS "asking for help" items, CSPI conflict situations)
- Ability to articulate feelings and discomfort (Child Mind Institute)
- Knowing how to call parent / request pickup (Nationwide Children's Hospital "exit strategy")
- Ability to say no to peers (CSPI conflict items)
- **Key insight from Child Mind Institute:** A child needs to be able to go to the host parent if there's a problem. This is both a skill and a comfort factor.

### Domain 5: Emotional Regulation
*"Can my child manage big feelings without me?"*
- Ability to calm down when upset (ERC Emotion Regulation subscale)
- Flexibility when routines change (ERC Lability/Negativity — low lability = good)
- Coping with homesickness or unexpected discomfort (clinical literature)
- Managing somatic symptoms of anxiety — stomachaches, etc. (SCARED, Child Mind Institute)
- Tolerating frustration in social situations (ERC, CSPI)
- **Key insight:** Emotional regulation is the meta-skill. A child with strong regulation can handle minor distress in every other domain.

### Domain 6: Social Comfort / Peer Navigation
*"Can my child navigate social dynamics without parental scaffolding?"*
- Comfort with the specific friend/family (Understood.org)
- Navigating peer conflict independently (CSPI conflict items)
- Handling social pressure (CABS)
- Adapting to other families' rules and norms (clinical literature)
- **Key insight:** This is more about the specific friendship/context than a general trait. Most clinical checklists ask "Does your child know this friend well?" rather than measuring abstract social skill.

## Item Types & Response Formats

| Instrument | Format | Scale Points | Anchors |
|---|---|---|---|
| SCARED | Likert | 3 | Not True / Sometimes True / Often True |
| SCAS | Frequency | 4 | Never / Sometimes / Often / Always |
| CSAS | Frequency | 5 | Never–Almost Always |
| SAAS | Frequency | 4 | Never / Sometimes / Most of the time / All the time |
| NFS | Self-report | varies | Fear intensity |
| ERC | Frequency (caregiver) | 4 | Likert |
| CSPI | Self-efficacy | 4 | Likert |
| CABS | Behavioral choice | 5 | Inhibited → Aggressive |

**Dominant pattern:** Most instruments use a 3–5 point frequency or agreement scale. For parent-report instruments (our likely format), 4-point scales are most common. The CABS is the outlier — it uses behavioral scenarios with multiple response options.

**For our quiz:** A 4-point parent-report frequency scale (Never / Sometimes / Often / Almost Always) is well-supported by the literature and avoids a neutral midpoint.

## Gaps

### No Dedicated Sleepover Readiness Instrument Exists
As expected, there is no validated psychometric instrument specifically for sleepover readiness. This construct sits at the intersection of multiple validated domains (separation anxiety, nighttime fears, self-care independence, emotional regulation, social assertiveness) but has never been assembled into a single measure.

### Parent-Report Bias
Most instruments assume parent/caregiver report, which works well for us (our quizzes are parent-facing). However, separation anxiety instruments like CSAS and SCARED also have child self-report versions. We're building parent-report only, which means we can't directly capture the child's subjective experience.

### Age Range Mismatch
Most separation anxiety instruments are validated for ages 8+. Sleepover readiness questions often arise for children ages 5–7. The FAWN-YC (ages 3–5) covers nighttime fears for younger children, but no separation anxiety instrument is validated below age 8. We'll need to write items appropriate for the 5–10 range without claiming psychometric validity for the youngest cohort.

### Self-Care Is Under-Measured
Validated instruments for daily living skills (Vineland, ABAS) are comprehensive clinical tools, not brief screeners. The self-care items relevant to sleepovers (can they brush teeth, use the toilet, change clothes) are so basic that they're almost checklist items rather than scaled measures. We'll need to handle this domain differently — perhaps as binary yes/no prerequisites rather than a scaled dimension.

### "Sleepunder" / Graduated Exposure Not Captured
The clinical literature (Nationwide Children's, Child Mind Institute) emphasizes graduated exposure — sleepunders, staying with relatives, backyard camping — as the primary intervention for building readiness. No instrument measures this gradient. We should consider prior experience as an input variable.

### Context-Dependence
Clinical sources emphasize that sleepover readiness depends heavily on the specific context — which friend, which family, which home. A child might be ready for a sleepover at grandma's but not at a new classmate's house. Our quiz can't easily capture this contextual variability.

## Recommended Approach

### 1. Structure: 4 Scored Domains + 1 Prerequisite Check
Compose the quiz from validated building blocks across four scaled domains, plus a binary prerequisite check:

**Prerequisites (binary yes/no, must-pass):**
- Basic self-care independence (toileting, teeth, changing — from Vineland/clinical checklists)
- Child has expressed interest (from Child Mind Institute principle that it should be child-initiated)

**Scaled domains:**
1. **Separation Comfort** (draw from CSAS 4-factor model + SAAS) — measure both anxiety AND confidence
2. **Nighttime Comfort** (draw from NFS + FAWN-YC) — sleeping in unfamiliar places, darkness, nightmares
3. **Communication & Help-Seeking** (draw from CABS + CSPI + Understood.org) — asking adults for help, expressing needs, calling parent
4. **Emotional Regulation** (draw from ERC) — calming down, flexibility, bouncing back

### 2. Response Format
Use a 4-point parent-report frequency scale: **Never / Rarely / Sometimes / Often** (or Never / Sometimes / Often / Almost Always). This is the modal format across instruments reviewed and avoids a neutral midpoint.

### 3. Item Count
Target 12–16 scored items (3–4 per domain) plus 3–4 prerequisite items. Total: ~16–20 items. This keeps the quiz under 5 minutes while covering all domains.

### 4. Include Positive/Readiness Items
Following the CSAS "Calm at Separation" factor, include positively-worded items that measure readiness signals, not just absence of anxiety:
- "My child is calm and happy when staying with other trusted adults"
- "My child looks forward to spending time at friends' houses"
- "My child can handle small problems on their own"

### 5. Graduated Result Categories
Rather than binary ready/not-ready, produce a graduated result:
- **Ready to try:** High readiness across all domains
- **Almost ready — try a sleepunder first:** Good in most domains, one area to build
- **Build up gradually:** Multiple areas need development; suggest specific stepping stones
- **Not yet — and that's okay:** Low readiness; normalize the timeline and suggest what to work on

### 6. Prior Experience as Context Variable
Include 1–2 items about prior overnight experience (stayed with relatives, done a sleepunder, camped out) as a moderating variable, not a scored domain. This follows the Nationwide Children's Hospital graduated approach.
