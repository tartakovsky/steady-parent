## Domains/Factors Identified

From the combined literature, these are the measurable domains relevant to a "what calming strategies work for your child" quiz:

### Domain 1: Regulation Style (how the child regulates)
- **Over-controlled** — appears regulated but internalizes; avoidant, inhibited, emotionally distressed underneath
- **Under-controlled** — externalizes; can't constrain emotions/behavior; high reactivity, low inhibition
- **Well-regulated** — flexible, context-appropriate responses
- Source: [PMC3018741](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3018741/); [PMC7556995](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7556995/)

### Domain 2: Temperamental Reactivity Profile
- **Anger/Frustration intensity** — how quickly and intensely the child reacts to blocked goals
- **Fear/Anxiety sensitivity** — how easily overwhelmed by novelty, uncertainty, perceived threat
- **Sadness/Withdrawal tendency** — response to loss or deprivation
- **Soothability** — how quickly/easily the child recovers once upset
- Source: CBQ (Rothbart); [Rothbart Questionnaires](https://research.bowdoin.edu/rothbart-temperament-questionnaires/instrument-descriptions/the-childrens-behavior-questionnaire/)

### Domain 3: Trigger Type
- **Goal-blocking** — toy taken, told no, transitions → anger/frustration pathway
- **Novelty/uncertainty** — new situations, separation, unfamiliar people → fear/anxiety pathway
- **Sensory overwhelm** — noise, crowds, textures, light → overstimulation pathway
- **Social conflict** — sibling disputes, peer rejection, fairness violations → mixed anger/sadness
- **Fatigue/hunger** — biological state lowers regulation capacity across all pathways
- Source: [PMC10216924](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10216924/); ERC research

### Domain 4: Sensory Processing Preference (Dunn's model)
- **Seeking** (high threshold, active) — needs MORE input to regulate: movement, heavy work, strong flavors
- **Avoiding** (low threshold, active) — needs LESS input: quiet space, reduced stimulation, predictable routine
- **Sensitivity** (low threshold, passive) — notices everything, gets overwhelmed but doesn't actively retreat
- **Low Registration** (high threshold, passive) — misses cues, may seem "checked out," needs alerting input
- Source: [Dunn's Model](https://ottheory.com/therapy-model/dunns-model-sensory-processing)

### Domain 5: Preferred Coping Channel
- **Physical/body-based** — movement, deep pressure, heavy work, proprioceptive input
- **Respiratory/breath-based** — deep breathing, counted breaths, blowing exercises
- **Sensory/tactile** — fidgets, textures, water play, playdough, weighted blankets
- **Cognitive/verbal** — naming feelings, reframing, self-talk, problem-solving out loud
- **Social/relational** — co-regulation with caregiver, physical closeness, talking it out
- **Creative/expressive** — drawing, music, storytelling, imaginative play
- **Environmental/withdrawal** — quiet space, alone time, reduced stimulation
- Source: ABA calming taxonomy; [ConnectABILITY](https://connectability.ca/2010/09/23/calming-strategies-to-use-with-children/); [OT Toolbox](https://www.theottoolbox.com/breathing-exercises-for-kids/)

### Domain 6: Environmental Context
- **Home vs. school** — regulation differs significantly by context (parent/teacher concordance is mixed)
- **Household chaos level** — noise, crowding, unpredictable routines reduce regulation capacity
- **Caregiver co-regulation availability** — child's regulation depends heavily on adult's calm presence
- Source: [Nature — household chaos study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-80383-5); [PMC3004175](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3004175/)

## Item Types & Response Formats

| Instrument | Reporter | Format | Scale |
|---|---|---|---|
| ERC | Parent/teacher | Frequency statements | 4-pt Likert (Never → Almost Always) |
| EERBQ | Caregiver | Behavioral descriptions | 3-pt (Not true → Certainly true) |
| DERS | Self (13+) | Agreement with difficulties | 5-pt Likert (Almost Never → Almost Always) |
| BRIEF-2 | Parent/teacher | Behavioral frequency | 3-pt (Never → Often) |
| CBQ | Parent | Behavioral vignettes | 7-pt (Extremely untrue → Extremely true) |
| CCSC | Self (9-13) | Strategy frequency | 4-pt (Never → Most of the time) |
| Kidcope | Self (5+) | Did you do this? + Did it help? | Dichotomous + efficacy |
| FEEL-KJ | Self (10+) | Strategy frequency | 5-pt (Almost never → Almost always) |
| Sensory Profile 2 | Caregiver | Behavioral frequency | 5-pt (Almost never → Almost always) |

**Most adaptable format for a parent-report quiz:** Behavioral vignettes or frequency statements with 4-5 point Likert scales. The parent observes behavior, not internal states. Keep items concrete ("When my child is upset, they...") rather than abstract.

## Key Items We Can Adapt

These are item *themes* from validated instruments that map directly to calm-down toolkit recommendation:

### From ERC (regulation style)
- "Can recover quickly from episodes of upset or distress" → Soothability
- "Is easily frustrated" → Reactivity threshold
- "Can say when s/he is feeling sad, angry, or mad" → Emotional awareness
- "Responds positively to neutral or friendly overtures by adults" → Co-regulation receptivity
- "Is prone to angry outbursts / tantrums" → Externalizing style
- "Is a cheerful child" (reverse-scored) → Baseline affect

### From CBQ (temperament → strategy match)
- Soothability items: how quickly the child recovers with and without adult help
- Anger/Frustration items: reaction to goal-blocking, interrupted activities
- Fear items: response to novelty, darkness, loud noises
- Inhibitory Control items: ability to wait, follow instructions when excited
- Perceptual Sensitivity items: noticing subtle stimuli (textures, sounds, smells)

### From Sensory Profile (sensory preference → strategy channel)
- Response to loud/unexpected sounds → auditory sensitivity
- Seeks movement/spinning/jumping → vestibular seeking
- Avoids messy textures / certain fabrics → tactile avoiding
- Doesn't notice when touched / bumped → low registration
- Calms with rocking, swinging, or car rides → vestibular calming

### From CCSC / Kidcope (coping channel preference)
- "I tried to calm myself down" → self-regulation attempt
- "I went off by myself" → withdrawal/solitude preference
- "I tried to think of different ways to solve it" → cognitive channel
- "I talked to someone about how I felt" → social/relational channel
- "I did something to take my mind off it" → distraction/physical channel

### From DERS (regulation difficulty profile)
- "When I'm upset, I have difficulty controlling my behavior" → impulse control
- "When I'm upset, I believe there is nothing I can do to feel better" → strategy access
- "I have no idea how I am feeling" → emotional awareness
- "I have difficulty making sense out of my feelings" → emotional clarity

## Gaps

1. **No single validated instrument covers the full space.** Existing measures focus on either (a) whether regulation is happening, (b) what strategies are used, or (c) sensory processing. None combine these into "given THIS child's profile, THESE strategies will work."

2. **Age gap for self-report.** Most self-report coping measures start at 9+. For ages 2-8 (our primary audience), everything must be parent-report of observable behavior. The EERBQ (ages 2-6) is the best option for younger children, but it has limited validation data.

3. **Strategy effectiveness is almost never measured.** Instruments ask "does your child do X?" but rarely "does X actually calm them down?" Kidcope is the exception (asks both use and perceived helpfulness), but has poor psychometric stability.

4. **Sensory-regulation link is clinical, not population-normed.** Sensory Profile 2 is designed for OT clinical use, not general-population quiz deployment. The four-quadrant model is solid but the items assume clinical observation context.

5. **Environmental/contextual moderation is acknowledged but not integrated.** We know household chaos and co-regulation availability matter, but no instrument combines child profile + environment into recommendation.

6. **Trigger-specific strategy matching has minimal instrument support.** Research shows children use different strategies for anger vs. fear, but no questionnaire operationalizes "what calming strategy works for what trigger type for this specific child."

7. **Creative/expressive coping channel is under-measured.** Drawing, music, storytelling as regulation strategies appear in clinical practice but are barely represented in validated instruments.

## Recommended Approach

### Quiz Architecture: 3-Section Parent Report

**Section A: "How does your child react?" (Reactivity Profile) — ~5-6 items**
Adapt from CBQ (Anger/Frustration, Fear, Soothability) and ERC (Lability/Negativity).
- Goal: classify the child's dominant emotional reactivity pattern (explosive/fast, slow-build/overwhelm, shutdown/withdraw, mixed)
- Format: behavioral vignettes, 4-point frequency scale

**Section B: "What does your child already do when upset?" (Natural Coping Style) — ~5-6 items**
Adapt from CCSC categories, Kidcope strategy list, and EERBQ.
- Goal: identify the child's natural coping channel (physical, social, withdrawal, cognitive, sensory)
- Format: "When upset, my child typically..." with concrete behavioral options
- Include both the strategy AND whether it seems to help (Kidcope's dual-ask model)

**Section C: "What calms your child down?" (Sensory & Environmental Preferences) — ~4-5 items**
Adapt from Sensory Profile quadrants (seeking/avoiding/sensitivity/registration) and environmental context research.
- Goal: identify sensory processing style and environmental conditions that support regulation
- Format: preference pairs or "works well / doesn't work" checklist for specific inputs (movement, quiet, touch, music, etc.)

### Scoring & Output
- Cross Sections A + B + C to produce a **personalized calm-down toolkit** — a ranked set of 5-8 specific strategies matched to the child's profile
- Each strategy recommendation cites the domain evidence (e.g., "Your child is a sensory seeker with high anger reactivity — movement-based strategies like jumping or running will help discharge the energy before cognitive strategies can land")
- Include **trigger-specific tips** (what to try for frustration meltdowns vs. anxiety spirals vs. sensory overwhelm)

### Total Items: 15-17
Short enough for completion in 3-4 minutes. Each item grounded in validated construct but rewritten for plain-language parent accessibility.

### Key Design Principles
1. **Parent-report only** — target age range is 2-10, so self-report is unreliable
2. **Observable behavior only** — "my child does X" not "my child feels X"
3. **Concrete, specific vignettes** — "When a toy is taken away, my child..." not "My child handles frustration well"
4. **Both strategy use AND effectiveness** — stolen from Kidcope's dual-ask
5. **Match, don't diagnose** — output is a toolkit of strategies, not a clinical label
6. **Acknowledge co-regulation** — some strategies require adult participation; flag this in output
