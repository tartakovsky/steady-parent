# Child Social Confidence — Instrument Research

## Validated Instruments Found

### 1. SSIS-RS (Social Skills Improvement System — Rating Scales)
- **What it measures:** Social skills across 7 subscales: Communication, Cooperation, Assertion, Responsibility, Empathy, Engagement, Self-Control. Also Problem Behaviors (30 items) and Academic Competence (7 items).
- **Items:** 46 social skill items (parent/teacher forms); student self-report also available
- **Age range:** 3–18 years
- **Response format:** 4-point frequency scale (Never / Seldom / Often / Almost Always)
- **Scoring:** Standard scores (M=100, SD=15). Test-retest reliability median r=.87 composite, r=.83 subscales.
- **Publisher:** Pearson. Proprietary, not freely available.
- **SEL Edition (SSIS SEL):** Reconfigures the same 46 items into 5 CASEL-aligned domains: Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, Relationships, Responsible Decision Making.
- **Most relevant subscales for us:** Assertion (asks for help, speaks up about problems), Engagement (invites others, makes friends easily, introduces self), Empathy, Cooperation.

### 2. SDQ — Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Peer Problems subscale)
- **What it measures:** 5 subscales — Emotional Problems, Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity, Peer Problems, Prosocial Behavior. Peer Problems is our target.
- **Items:** 25 total (5 per subscale). Peer Problems = 5 items.
- **Peer Problems items:** Rather solitary / tends to play alone; Has at least one good friend (reverse); Generally liked by other children (reverse); Picked on or bullied by other children; Gets along better with adults than with other children.
- **Age range:** 4–17 (parent/teacher version); 11–17 (self-report)
- **Response format:** 3-point scale (Not True / Somewhat True / Certainly True)
- **Scoring:** 0–10 per subscale. Cutoffs: 0–2 normal, 3 borderline, 4–10 abnormal for peer problems.
- **Availability:** FREE. Open access at sdqinfo.org. Translated into 80+ languages.
- **Prosocial subscale also relevant:** Considerate of other people's feelings; Shares readily; Helpful if someone is hurt; Kind to younger children; Often volunteers to help.

### 3. SPPC — Self-Perception Profile for Children (Social Acceptance subscale)
- **What it measures:** Domain-specific self-concept across 6 subscales: Scholastic Competence, Social Acceptance, Athletic Competence, Physical Appearance, Behavioral Conduct, Global Self-Worth.
- **Items:** 36 total (6 per subscale). Social Acceptance = 6 items.
- **Social Acceptance example items:** "Some kids find it hard to make friends BUT Other kids find it pretty easy to make friends"; "Some kids have a lot of friends BUT Other kids don't have very many friends"; "Some kids wish that more people their age liked them BUT Other kids feel that most people their age do like them."
- **Age range:** 8–12 years (Harter, 1985; revised 2012)
- **Response format:** Structured alternative format — child picks which of two descriptions fits them, then rates "Really true for me" or "Sort of true for me" (effectively a 4-point scale).
- **Note:** Self-report only. Measures child's *perception* of social acceptance, not observed behavior. This is valuable — it captures the confidence dimension directly.

### 4. SASC-R — Social Anxiety Scale for Children — Revised
- **What it measures:** Social anxiety via 3 subscales: Fear of Negative Evaluation from Peers (FNE); Social Avoidance and Distress — New Situations (SAD-New); Generalized Social Avoidance and Distress (SAD-General).
- **Items:** 18 descriptive self-statements + 4 filler items (22 total)
- **Age range:** 6–13 years (SASC-R); adolescent version = SAS-A
- **Response format:** 5-point Likert (1=Not at all, 5=All the time)
- **Reliability:** Internal consistency alpha .69–.86 across subscales
- **Key insight:** This measures the anxiety/avoidance side of social confidence — fear of judgment, discomfort in new groups, general social withdrawal. Direct inverse of what we call "social confidence."

### 5. SEARS-P — Social Emotional Assets and Resilience Scales (Parent form)
- **What it measures:** Strength-based assessment of social-emotional competence. 3 subscales: Self-Regulation/Responsibility, Social Competence, Empathy.
- **Items:** 39 items (parent form)
- **Age range:** 5–18 years
- **Response format:** Frequency rating scale
- **Key distinction:** Strength-based (measures what kids CAN do, not deficits). Social Competence subscale directly relevant.
- **Publisher:** PAR (Psychological Assessment Resources). Proprietary.

### 6. PEERS-Q — Paediatric Evaluation of Emotions, Relationships, and Socialisation Questionnaire
- **What it measures:** Everyday social competence across 6 subscales: Relationships, Participation, Social Rules, Social Communication, Social Cognition, Behaviour.
- **Items:** 55 items (parent/caregiver report)
- **Age range:** 5–15 years
- **Reliability:** Good to very good (alpha = .89 total, subscales .78–.95)
- **Key distinction:** Focuses on social-cognitive skills (emotion recognition, empathy, theory of mind) that underpin everyday competence. Newer instrument with modern psychometric development.

### 7. Social Competence Scale — Parent Version (Fast Track Project)
- **What it measures:** Prosocial behaviors, communication skills, and self-control. 2 subscales: Prosocial/Communication Skills; Emotional Regulation Skills.
- **Items:** 12 items (very brief)
- **Age range:** Elementary school age
- **Scoring:** Mean of item responses per subscale
- **Key advantage:** Short, free (research instrument from Fast Track), captures the behavioral side concisely.

### 8. PROMIS Pediatric Peer Relationships — Parent Proxy
- **What it measures:** Positive interactions, sociability, and empathic behaviors with peers over past 7 days.
- **Items:** 7-item short form (from larger item bank)
- **Age range:** 5–17 (parent proxy)
- **Response format:** 5-point scale
- **Scoring:** T-scores (M=50, SD=10). Reliability >0.90 for most of score range.
- **Example items:** "My child was able to count on his/her friends"; "My child was able to talk about everything with his/her friends."
- **Key advantage:** Part of NIH measurement system, modern IRT-based calibration, freely available.

## Domains/Factors Identified

Across all instruments, the following distinct domains emerge for child social confidence:

### Core Domains (appear in 3+ instruments)
1. **Peer Comfort / Social Ease** — Comfort interacting with peers, willingness to participate, absence of avoidance (SDQ, SASC-R, SPPC, PROMIS)
2. **Assertion / Initiative** — Starting conversations, asking for help, speaking up, introducing self, inviting others (SSIS, SEARS, Fast Track SCS)
3. **Empathy / Social Awareness** — Reading others' emotions, consideration, perspective-taking (SSIS, SEARS, SDQ prosocial, PEERS-Q)
4. **Friendship Quality / Closeness** — Having friends, maintaining friendships, being liked (SDQ, SPPC, PROMIS)
5. **Cooperation / Conflict Navigation** — Working with others, handling disagreements without aggression, turn-taking (SSIS, SEARS, Fast Track SCS)

### Secondary Domains
6. **Social Anxiety / Fear of Judgment** — Worry about peers' opinions, avoidance of new social situations (SASC-R specifically; inverse of confidence)
7. **Social Communication** — Conversational skills, listening, understanding social rules (PEERS-Q, SSIS Communication)
8. **Self-Regulation in Social Contexts** — Controlling impulses during play, managing frustration with peers (SSIS Self-Control, SEARS, Fast Track SCS)

## Item Types & Response Formats

| Instrument | Format | Points | Reporter |
|---|---|---|---|
| SSIS-RS | Frequency (Never → Almost Always) | 4-point | Parent, Teacher, Student |
| SDQ | Agreement (Not True → Certainly True) | 3-point | Parent, Teacher, Self (11+) |
| SPPC | Structured alternative ("Some kids... BUT other kids...") | 4-point effective | Self only |
| SASC-R | Frequency (Not at all → All the time) | 5-point | Self only |
| SEARS-P | Frequency rating | Multi-point | Parent |
| PEERS-Q | Observer rating | Multi-point | Parent |
| PROMIS Peer | Frequency/agreement | 5-point | Parent proxy or Self |
| Fast Track SCS | Not specified publicly | Multi-point | Parent |

**Most common format:** Frequency-based Likert (how often does the child do X). This is the most natural for parent-report.

**Most interesting format:** Harter's structured alternative (SPPC). Forces a choice between two descriptions rather than rating agreement. Reduces acquiescence bias. But only works for self-report.

## Key Items We Can Adapt

Drawn from across instruments, organized by our target domains. These are *conceptual themes* informed by validated items — not reproductions of copyrighted content.

### Peer Comfort / Social Ease
- Willingness to approach new groups of children
- Comfort level at playdates, birthday parties, group activities
- Preference for playing alone vs. with others (not as pathology — as pattern)
- Comfort level with children they don't know well
- Whether child gets along better with adults than peers (SDQ signal item)

### Assertion / Social Initiative
- Starting conversations with other kids
- Asking peers to play / inviting others to join
- Speaking up when something bothers them (with peers, not just adults)
- Introducing themselves in new settings
- Asking for help from peers (not just adults)

### Empathy Expression
- Noticing when another child is upset or hurt
- Offering comfort or help to distressed peers
- Sharing toys/materials without prompting
- Adjusting behavior based on others' reactions
- Showing concern for fairness in group activities

### Conflict Navigation
- Handling disagreements with words rather than physical responses
- Willingness to compromise or take turns
- Recovery after conflicts (ability to re-engage with the peer)
- Seeking adult help for conflicts they cannot resolve vs. melting down
- Tolerating not getting their way in group decisions

### Friendship Quality
- Having at least one close friend
- Being sought out by other kids
- Sustaining friendships over time (not just initial contact)
- Reciprocal play (both kids engaged and enjoying)
- Being generally liked / welcomed by peers

### Social Anxiety Signals (inverse indicators)
- Reluctance or refusal to attend social events
- Physical complaints before social situations (stomach ache, etc.)
- Worry about what other kids think of them
- Avoiding speaking up in groups
- Clinging to parent in peer settings past age-appropriate level

## Gaps

### What existing instruments DON'T cover well (for our purposes):

1. **Age granularity for toddlers/preschoolers (2–4).** Most validated instruments start at 4–5. Toddler social behavior is qualitatively different (parallel play, emerging sharing). The ITSEA covers infants/toddlers but is clinical-grade and long.

2. **Parent self-awareness about their role.** No instrument captures how the parent's own behavior (hovering, forcing apologies, engineering social situations) affects the child's social confidence. This is a Steady Parent differentiator.

3. **Digital/screen-mediated social interaction.** Validated instruments predate the era of kids socializing via games, FaceTime, tablets. No subscale for "comfort in online vs. in-person social settings."

4. **Cultural context of social confidence.** What counts as "assertive" vs. "rude" varies enormously across cultures. Most instruments are normed on US/Western populations. The SDQ has 80+ translations but norms still skew Western.

5. **Sibling relationships as social practice.** Most peer instruments focus on non-family peers. Sibling interaction is a major social training ground that existing instruments treat separately.

6. **Context sensitivity.** A child may be confident at school but anxious at birthday parties, or fine one-on-one but overwhelmed in groups. Most instruments don't capture this situational variation well (the SASC-R's SAD-New vs. SAD-General distinction is the best attempt).

## Recommended Approach

### Quiz Design Strategy

**Target construct:** Parent-perceived child social confidence — a composite of the child's comfort in peer settings, willingness to initiate social contact, empathy expression, and ability to navigate social friction.

**Reporter:** Parent (this is a parenting blog; self-report instruments for kids 8+ are not appropriate for our format).

**Recommended format:**
- **5–7 questions** (aligns with BuzzFeed sweet spot and keeps completion rate high)
- **Scenario-based items** rather than abstract trait ratings. Instead of "My child is assertive," use "Your child is at the playground and wants to join a group of kids playing. They usually..." This is more engaging for a blog quiz and reduces the tendency to give socially desirable answers.
- **4 response options per item** — each mapping to a result archetype. Avoid binary yes/no (too blunt) and avoid 5+ options (decision fatigue).

**Recommended domains to cover (one question per domain, roughly):**
1. **Social approach style** — How do they enter new social situations? (maps to: Assertion/Initiative + Social Anxiety)
2. **Peer comfort in groups** — How do they behave in group play? (maps to: Peer Comfort/Social Ease)
3. **Conflict response** — What happens when there's a disagreement with a peer? (maps to: Conflict Navigation)
4. **Empathy signals** — How do they respond when another child is upset? (maps to: Empathy Expression)
5. **Friendship patterns** — What do their friendships look like? (maps to: Friendship Quality)
6. **Parent role / scaffolding** — How much do you help facilitate their social life? (maps to: our unique angle — parent's scaffolding behavior)

**Result archetypes (4 profiles, all positive/neutral — per quiz design principles):**
- The Social Butterfly (high comfort, high initiative, may need support with depth over breadth)
- The Selective Connector (cautious approach, strong once comfortable, deep friendships)
- The Quiet Observer (watches first, empathetic, needs encouragement with initiation)
- The Solo Explorer (independent, content alone, building peer skills at their own pace)

### What to draw from each instrument:
| Our Domain | Primary Source Instruments |
|---|---|
| Social approach style | SASC-R (SAD-New), SSIS Assertion + Engagement |
| Peer comfort in groups | SDQ Peer Problems, SPPC Social Acceptance |
| Conflict response | SSIS Cooperation + Self-Control, SEARS Self-Regulation |
| Empathy signals | SSIS Empathy, SDQ Prosocial, SEARS Empathy |
| Friendship patterns | SDQ Peer Problems, PROMIS Peer Relationships |
| Parent scaffolding | No validated instrument — our original contribution |

### Important caveats:
- We are creating an **entertainment/educational quiz**, not a clinical screening tool. We should never claim diagnostic validity.
- Items should be **inspired by** validated constructs but rewritten as engaging scenarios in our voice.
- Results should always include "this is normal developmental variation" framing and point toward our articles for deeper content.
- Age matters enormously. A 2-year-old playing alone is developmentally appropriate; a 7-year-old consistently avoiding peers may warrant attention. Consider adding an age-gating question or age-adjusted result copy.
