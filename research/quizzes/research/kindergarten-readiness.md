# Kindergarten Readiness -- Instrument Research

## Validated Instruments Found

### 1. Ages & Stages Questionnaires, Third Edition (ASQ-3)
- **Publisher:** Brookes Publishing (Squires & Bricker)
- **What it measures:** Developmental screening across 5 domains: Communication, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Problem Solving, Personal-Social
- **Items:** 30 items per age interval (6 per domain), arranged hierarchically within each domain
- **Age range:** 1-66 months (21 age-specific questionnaires; 48, 54, and 60-month intervals most relevant)
- **Completed by:** Parent/caregiver
- **Response format:** 3-point: Yes (10), Sometimes (5), Not Yet (0)
- **Administration time:** 10-15 minutes
- **Psychometric quality:** Rating "A -- Psychometrics Well-Demonstrated." Normative sample of 18,000+ questionnaires. High reliability, internal consistency, sensitivity, and specificity.
- **Relevance to us:** Parent-completed, simple response scale, scenario-based items ("Does your child..."), covers motor + communication + problem-solving domains. The 3-point response format is a close match to our quiz format.

### 2. ASQ:SE-2 (Social-Emotional, Second Edition)
- **Publisher:** Brookes Publishing
- **What it measures:** Social-emotional development across 7 areas: self-regulation, compliance, adaptive functioning, autonomy, affect, social-communication, interaction with people
- **Items:** 9 age-appropriate questionnaires (2-60 months)
- **Completed by:** Parent/caregiver
- **Response format:** 3-point frequency: "Often or always," "Sometimes," "Rarely or never" -- plus a concern checkbox per item
- **Administration time:** 10-15 minutes
- **Psychometric quality:** Normative sample of 16,000+. High reliability, internal consistency, sensitivity, and specificity.
- **Relevance to us:** Covers the social-emotional domain our quiz-ideas.md lists. Parent-completed. Frequency-based response format works well for behavioral observations.

### 3. Bracken School Readiness Assessment, Fourth Edition (BSRA-4)
- **Publisher:** Pearson (Bruce Bracken)
- **What it measures:** Understanding of foundational academic concepts across 5 subtests: Colors, Letters, Numbers/Counting, Sizes/Comparisons, Shapes (prior editions had 6 subtests including separate Sizes and Comparisons)
- **Items:** 85-88 items across subtests
- **Age range:** 3:0 to 6:11
- **Completed by:** Examiner-administered (child points to correct picture from array)
- **Response format:** "Show me..." pointing task -- examiner shows stimulus pictures, child points to correct answer
- **Administration time:** 10-15 minutes
- **Psychometric quality:** Internal consistency 0.98 overall; subtest reliability 0.85-0.98. Concurrent validity with PPVT-III: r = 0.69-0.79.
- **Relevance to us:** Covers academic/cognitive concepts domain. However, it is examiner-administered and tests the CHILD directly -- not parent-report. We would need to translate these into "Can your child..." parent-report format. The specific concept categories (colors, letters, numbers, shapes, sizes) are useful domain markers.

### 4. DIAL-4 (Developmental Indicators for the Assessment of Learning, Fourth Edition)
- **Publisher:** Pearson (Mardell-Czudnowski & Goldenberg)
- **What it measures:** 5 domains: Motor, Concepts, Language, Self-Help, Social Development
- **Items:** Full version ~60-90 minutes; Speed DIAL-4 subset ~20 minutes
- **Age range:** 2:6 to 5:11
- **Completed by:** Examiner-administered performance tasks + teacher/caregiver observation ratings for Self-Help and Social Development
- **Response format:** Mixed -- performance-based measures for Motor/Concepts/Language; rating scales based on observation for Self-Help and Social Development
- **Psychometric quality:** Provides standard deviation and percentile cutoff points by chronological age at two-month intervals
- **Relevance to us:** Self-Help and Social Development domains use observational ratings that parents could complete. These domains map directly to our "self-help skills" domain from quiz-ideas.md.

### 5. Brigance Early Childhood Screen III
- **Publisher:** Curriculum Associates
- **What it measures:** 4 domains: Physical Development, Language Development, Academic Skills/Cognitive Development, Self-help and Social-Emotional Skills
- **Items:** Varies by age; each screen takes 10-15 minutes per child
- **Age range:** Birth through first grade (multiple age-specific screens)
- **Completed by:** Examiner-administered (observation, interviews, child performance)
- **Response format:** Circle correct / slash incorrect for each skill item; cutoff scores for delays and giftedness
- **Psychometric quality:** Technical manual includes reliability, validity, sensitivity, and specificity data
- **Relevance to us:** Covers all four domains we need. Self-help and Social-Emotional items are closest to parent-reportable questions.

### 6. Early Development Instrument (EDI)
- **Publisher:** Offord Centre (McMaster University)
- **What it measures:** 5 domains: Physical Health and Well-being, Social Competence, Emotional Maturity, Language and Cognitive Development, Communication Skills and General Knowledge
- **Items:** ~100+ items across domains
- **Age range:** Kindergarten-age children
- **Completed by:** Kindergarten teachers
- **Response format:** Teacher-reported observational recall
- **Psychometric quality:** Validated population-level measure; EDI ratings strongly predict 3rd grade academic proficiency
- **Relevance to us:** Provides the most comprehensive domain breakdown of any instrument found. The 5-domain model is well-validated and maps nicely to quiz domains. However, it is teacher-completed, not parent-completed.

### 7. Teaching Strategies GOLD
- **Publisher:** Teaching Strategies LLC
- **What it measures:** 9 broad skill areas (Social-Emotional, Physical, Language, Cognitive, Literacy, Mathematics, Science & Technology, Social Studies, Arts) broken into 38 objectives and 65 dimensions
- **Items:** 49 core items across 6 readiness domains
- **Age range:** Birth through kindergarten
- **Completed by:** Teachers (observation-based)
- **Response format:** Progressions of development with behavioral indicators -- teachers rate along a developmental continuum
- **Psychometric quality:** Widely used, validated; 1,109 children in 90 classrooms in validation studies
- **Relevance to us:** The 38 objectives provide extremely granular skill descriptions we can mine for item ideas. Teacher-completed, but the behavioral indicators translate well to parent observation.

### 8. Devereux Early Childhood Assessment (DECA-P2)
- **Publisher:** Devereux Center for Resilient Children
- **What it measures:** Protective factors (Initiative, Self-Regulation, Attachment/Relationships) + Behavioral Concerns
- **Items:** 38 items (27 protective factor + 11 behavioral concerns)
- **Age range:** 2-5 years
- **Completed by:** Parent AND/OR teacher
- **Response format:** 5-point frequency scale: Never / Rarely / Occasionally / Frequently / Very Frequently. Stem: "During the past 4 weeks, how often did the child..."
- **Psychometric quality:** Nationally normed; strong three-factor structure confirmed via factor analysis
- **Relevance to us:** Strength-based (protective factors) aligns with our "no bad results" design principle. Parent-completable. Frequency-based response format is well-validated for behavioral items.

### 9. Lollipop Test
- **Publisher:** Green Dragon Books (Alex Chew)
- **What it measures:** School readiness via 4 subtests: (1) Colors and Shapes identification/copying, (2) Picture description/position/spatial recognition, (3) Numbers/counting, (4) Letters/writing
- **Items:** ~50 items across subtests
- **Age range:** Pre-K to first grade
- **Administration time:** 15-20 minutes
- **Completed by:** Examiner-administered
- **Response format:** Direct child performance -- stimulus cards shown, child responds
- **Psychometric quality:** Published validation study (Chew & Morris, 1984, Educational and Psychological Measurement)
- **Relevance to us:** Covers academic foundations domain. Examiner-administered, so items need translation to parent-report.

### 10. PEDS (Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status)
- **Publisher:** PEDStest.com
- **What it measures:** 10 developmental categories: Expressive Language, Receptive Language, Social-Emotional, Behavioral, Fine Motor, Gross Motor, Self-Help, School, Cognitive, Health
- **Items:** 10 questions (one per category)
- **Age range:** 0-8 years
- **Completed by:** Parent
- **Response format:** 3-point: Yes / No / A Little
- **Administration time:** A few minutes
- **Psychometric quality:** Validated; parent concerns on self-help and school skills predict low language and academic scores
- **Relevance to us:** Extremely brief parent-completed screen. Its 10 categories provide a useful high-level domain map. However, at 1 item per domain it is too coarse for our purposes -- we need more items per domain.

### 11. Preschool Learning Behaviors Scale (PLBS)
- **Publisher:** McDermott et al.
- **What it measures:** Approaches to learning: Competence Motivation (11 items), Attention/Persistence (9 items), Attitude Toward Learning (7 items)
- **Items:** 29 items
- **Age range:** 3-5.5 years
- **Completed by:** Teacher-rated
- **Psychometric quality:** Factor-derived subscales validated
- **Relevance to us:** Covers the "approaches to learning" domain that research shows is a strong predictor. Items like "shows lively interest in activities" and "sticks to an activity for as long as can be expected" are translatable to parent report.


## Domains/Factors Identified

Research converges on **5 major domains** of kindergarten readiness. The U.S. Department of Education framework and most validated instruments align with these:

### 1. Social-Emotional Development
- Relationship formation with peers and teachers
- Sharing, taking turns, cooperating
- Following rules and group norms
- Empathy, comforting others
- Managing disagreements
- **Measured by:** ASQ:SE-2, DECA-P2, EDI (Social Competence + Emotional Maturity), DIAL-4 (Social Development), TS GOLD

### 2. Self-Regulation / Executive Function / Approaches to Learning
- Attention and persistence on tasks (5-10 minutes without supervision)
- Emotional regulation (calming down after upset, transitioning between activities)
- Following multi-step directions
- Inhibitory control
- Working memory
- Curiosity, engagement, flexibility, persistence, frustration tolerance
- **Measured by:** DECA-P2 (Self-Regulation), PLBS (Attention/Persistence, Competence Motivation), ASQ:SE-2 (Compliance, Self-Regulation)
- **Research note:** Self-regulation is a stronger predictor of first-grade academic performance than familial background or even cognitive abilities.

### 3. Language, Literacy & Communication
- Expressive vocabulary (1,000-1,500 words by kindergarten)
- Receptive vocabulary (~4,000 words)
- Sentence construction (up to 8 words)
- Storytelling and retelling
- Letter recognition (at minimum, letters in own name)
- Phonological awareness (rhyming, initial sounds)
- Print awareness (holding a book, left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- Writing own first name
- **Measured by:** ASQ-3 (Communication), BSRA (Letters), Brigance (Language, Academic), EDI (Language/Cognitive + Communication), DIBELS, PALS-K

### 4. Cognition, Mathematics & General Knowledge
- Counting to 10-20 with one-to-one correspondence
- Numeral recognition (1-10)
- Color identification
- Shape identification (circle, square, triangle, rectangle)
- Size comparisons (bigger/smaller, taller/shorter)
- Sorting and classifying
- Pattern recognition
- Sequencing (first, next, last)
- Basic time concepts (yesterday, today, tomorrow)
- **Measured by:** BSRA (Colors, Numbers, Shapes, Sizes/Comparisons), Lollipop Test, Brigance (Academic/Cognitive), TS GOLD (Math, Cognitive)

### 5. Physical Development & Self-Help Skills
- **Gross motor:** Hopping on one foot, skipping, throwing, catching, balance
- **Fine motor:** Holding pencil with 3-4 fingers, cutting with scissors along lines, copying shapes, writing letters
- **Self-care:** Dressing independently (buttons, zippers), toileting independently, handwashing, managing belongings
- **Health:** Expressing health needs ("I'm hungry," "My head hurts")
- **Measured by:** ASQ-3 (Gross Motor, Fine Motor), DIAL-4 (Motor, Self-Help), EDI (Physical Health and Well-being), Brigance (Physical Development)

### Domain Weighting from Research
Research strongly suggests that social-emotional readiness and self-regulation are the **most predictive** domains for kindergarten success, even more than academic skills. Teachers consistently rank social-emotional skills and executive function above letter/number knowledge when asked what matters most for school readiness.


## Item Types & Response Formats

### Response Formats Used by Validated Instruments

| Instrument | Completed By | Scale | Options |
|-----------|-------------|-------|---------|
| ASQ-3 | Parent | 3-point capability | Yes / Sometimes / Not Yet |
| ASQ:SE-2 | Parent | 3-point frequency | Often or always / Sometimes / Rarely or never |
| DECA-P2 | Parent or Teacher | 5-point frequency | Never / Rarely / Occasionally / Frequently / Very Frequently |
| PEDS | Parent | 3-point concern | Yes / No / A Little |
| BSRA | Examiner | Binary (point to correct) | Correct / Incorrect |
| Brigance | Examiner | Binary | Correct / Incorrect |
| EDI | Teacher | Observational rating | Various scales per item |
| KRA (state) | Teacher | Rubric-scored | Performance task / Selected response / Observation |

### Item Stem Patterns

**Parent-report items typically use:**
- "Does your child [specific observable behavior]?" (ASQ-3 style)
- "Can your child [specific skill]?" (checklist style)
- "During the past 4 weeks, how often did your child [specific behavior]?" (DECA style)

**The most common parent-report format is the ASQ-3 style:**
- Simple behavioral description
- Parent tries the activity with the child or recalls recent behavior
- 3-point response: Yes / Sometimes / Not Yet

### Item Content Patterns

**Behavioral observation items (best for parent report):**
- "Does your child share possessions with other children?"
- "Can your child follow 2-3 step directions?"
- "Does your child stay with an engaging task for 5-10 minutes?"
- "Can your child express their needs in words?"

**Skill demonstration items (require translation for parent report):**
- "Can your child count 10 objects, pointing to each one?"
- "Does your child recognize and name at least 5 colors?"
- "Can your child write the letters in their first name?"
- "Can your child cut along a line with scissors?"

**Self-help items:**
- "Can your child dress with minimal help (buttons, zippers)?"
- "Does your child use the toilet independently?"
- "Can your child wash and dry their hands?"


## Key Items We Can Adapt

Based on validated instruments, here are specific question types mapped to our quiz format (3-option response: Yes/Sometimes/Not Yet, per our potty training quiz pattern):

### Social-Emotional Domain (3-4 items)
1. **Peer interaction** (from ASQ:SE-2, EDI): "Does your child play cooperatively with other children -- sharing, taking turns, and following group rules?"
2. **Separation comfort** (from DECA attachment scale, DIAL-4): "Can your child separate from you at a familiar place (like school or a friend's house) without prolonged distress?"
3. **Emotional regulation** (from DECA self-regulation, ASQ:SE-2): "When your child gets upset or frustrated, can they calm down within a few minutes with minimal help?"
4. **Following adult directions** (from PLBS, EDI): "Does your child follow 2-3 step instructions from adults other than you (like a teacher or coach)?"

### Self-Regulation / Approaches to Learning (2 items)
5. **Sustained attention** (from PLBS attention/persistence): "Can your child stay focused on a single activity (drawing, building, puzzles) for at least 10 minutes without needing redirection?"
6. **Transition management** (from DECA, TS GOLD): "Can your child stop one activity and move to the next without major protests when given a heads-up?"

### Language & Literacy Domain (2 items)
7. **Letter/name recognition** (from BSRA, Brigance): "Does your child recognize most of the letters in their first name and attempt to write it?"
8. **Communication** (from ASQ-3 Communication, EDI): "Can your child tell you about something that happened (at a playdate, at school) in sentences that a stranger could mostly understand?"

### Cognitive / Math Domain (1-2 items)
9. **Counting/number sense** (from BSRA, Brigance): "Can your child count at least 10 objects, pointing to each one as they count?"
10. **Basic concepts** (from BSRA): "Does your child know basic colors (at least 5), common shapes (circle, square, triangle), and size comparisons (bigger/smaller)?"

### Physical / Self-Help Domain (1-2 items)
11. **Fine motor** (from ASQ-3 Fine Motor, Brigance): "Can your child hold a pencil or crayon with their fingers (not a fist grip) and draw recognizable shapes or letters?"
12. **Self-care independence** (from DIAL-4 Self-Help, EDI): "Can your child manage bathroom needs, handwashing, and getting dressed (including buttons/zippers) mostly on their own?"


## Gaps

### What quiz-ideas.md says:
- **Domains listed:** social-emotional, self-help skills, academic foundations, communication
- **Connected categories:** social-skills, anxiety, transitions
- **Quiz type:** Assessment (Type A) -- each question belongs to one domain, scored by total + domain-level content

### What research supports vs. what is missing:

| quiz-ideas.md Domain | Research Support | Gap |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----|
| Social-emotional | STRONG -- most-validated domain, strongest predictor of success | None -- well-aligned |
| Self-help skills | MODERATE -- validated in DIAL-4, EDI, Brigance, checklists | Consider folding into Physical Development (how most instruments do it) |
| Academic foundations | STRONG -- BSRA entirely covers this; literacy + math well-validated | quiz-ideas.md is vague here. Should split into Literacy/Language AND Math/Cognitive per research |
| Communication | STRONG -- covered by ASQ-3, EDI, multiple instruments | Overlaps significantly with Language/Literacy. Research treats these together |

### Key gaps:
1. **Self-regulation / Executive Function / Approaches to Learning is MISSING from quiz-ideas.md** -- This is arguably the most important domain per research. It is a stronger predictor of school success than academic skills. Must add.
2. **Physical/Motor development not listed** -- Fine motor (pencil grip, scissors) and gross motor (balance, coordination) are included in every validated instrument. Fine motor in particular predicts academic outcomes.
3. **"Academic foundations" is too vague** -- Research distinguishes clearly between literacy (letters, phonological awareness, print concepts) and math/cognitive (counting, shapes, colors, comparisons). These should be separate or at least clearly defined sub-areas.
4. **"Communication" overlaps with literacy** -- In most instruments, expressive language, vocabulary, and sentence construction live within Language/Literacy, not as a separate domain.


## Recommended Approach

### Domain Structure (5 domains, mapping to research)

Based on the validated instrument research, I recommend restructuring to 5 domains:

| Domain | Research Basis | # Items |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Social-Emotional** | ASQ:SE-2, DECA-P2, EDI | 2-3 |
| **Self-Regulation & Approaches to Learning** | PLBS, DECA, executive function research | 2 |
| **Language & Literacy** | ASQ-3, BSRA (Letters), Brigance, EDI | 2 |
| **Math & Cognitive Foundations** | BSRA (Numbers, Colors, Shapes, Sizes), Lollipop | 1-2 |
| **Physical Development & Self-Help** | ASQ-3 (Motor), DIAL-4 (Self-Help), EDI | 1-2 |

**Total: 8-10 questions** (matches our 6-10 question target from quiz-ideas.md design principles)

### Response Format

Use the **ASQ-3 style 3-point scale**, which is:
- Already validated for parent report
- Matches our existing potty training quiz format (Yes/Sometimes/Not Yet)
- Simple enough for a 2-minute quiz

Adapt to our voice:
- "Yes, consistently" / "Sometimes or emerging" / "Not yet"
- Points: 3 / 1 / 0 (or 2/1/0 depending on item weight)

### Item Design Principles

1. **Ask about observable behaviors, not opinions** -- "Can your child stay focused for 10 minutes?" not "Do you think your child is ready?"
2. **Prioritize social-emotional and self-regulation items** -- Research says these matter most; they are also more interesting/shareable than "does your kid know their ABCs"
3. **Include subtext with concrete examples** -- Following the ASQ-3 approach where parents try activities with their child or recall specific recent observations
4. **Weight items by predictive importance** -- Social-emotional and self-regulation items should carry more weight than academic items per research
5. **Frame results as readiness profile, not pass/fail** -- Following DECA's strength-based approach: "Here's what's strong and here's what's still developing"

### Result Structure

Three tiers (matching potty training quiz pattern):
- **Green Light** (high total): "Ready to thrive" -- strong across domains
- **Yellow Light** (medium total): "Almost there" -- some domains strong, some emerging
- **Not Quite Yet** (low total): "Building the foundations" -- validate what IS developing

Each result includes domain-level breakdown showing which areas are strong vs. still developing, with specific next-step suggestions per domain.

### Age Range

**4:0 to 6:0** (48-72 months) -- the sweet spot where kindergarten readiness is most relevant and where most validated instruments have age-specific norms.
