# Parenting Battery — Instrument Research

## Validated Instruments Found

### 1. Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA)
- **Citation:** Roskam, I., Brianda, M.E., & Mikolajczak, M. (2018). A Step Forward in the Conceptualization and Measurement of Parental Burnout: The Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA). *Frontiers in Psychology*, 9, 758.
- **What it measures:** Four dimensions of parental burnout, developed inductively from testimonies of burned-out parents (not adapted from job burnout).
- **Items:** 23 items across 4 subscales
- **Validation sample:** N = 901 parents (79.6% women; 71.8% English-speaking, 28.2% French-speaking)
- **Reliability:** Global alpha = 0.96; subscale alphas = 0.77–0.94
- **Clinical cutoffs:** Score >86 = burnout; score 53–86 = at risk; score <53 = not at risk (total range 0–138)
- **Status:** Gold standard. Translated and validated in 21+ languages. Available online at burnoutparental.com with automatic feedback.

### 2. Parental Burnout Inventory (PBI)
- **Citation:** Roskam, I., Raes, M.-E., & Mikolajczak, M. (2017). Exhausted Parents: Development and Preliminary Validation of the Parental Burnout Inventory. *Frontiers in Psychology*, 8, 163.
- **What it measures:** Three dimensions of parental burnout, adapted from the Maslach Burnout Inventory with "depersonalization" replaced by "emotional distancing."
- **Items:** 22 items across 3 subscales
- **Validation:** Study 1: N = 379; Study 2: N = 1,723. CFI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.06.
- **Reliability:** Emotional Exhaustion alpha = 0.95; Emotional Distancing alpha = 0.88; Personal Accomplishment alpha = 0.87; Global alpha = 0.91
- **Status:** Superseded by the PBA, which added a fourth dimension (contrast with previous self) and was built inductively rather than deductively from job burnout.

### 3. Brief Parental Burnout Scale (BPBS)
- **Citation:** Aunola, K., Sorkkila, M., & Tolvanen, A. (2021). Development and Validation of the Brief Parental Burnout Scale (BPBS). *Psychological Assessment*, 33(11), 1125–1137.
- **What it measures:** Screening tool covering exhaustion, distancing, and parental ineffectiveness (3 of 4 PBA factors).
- **Items:** 5 items selected from PBA via Item Response Theory (IRT) Graded Response Model
- **Validation:** N = 1,725 Finnish parents. High sensitivity and specificity against PBA total score.
- **Status:** Best existing model for a short-form screening quiz. Demonstrates that 5 well-chosen items can reliably screen for burnout.

### 4. Working Parent Burnout Scale (WPBS)
- **Citation:** Gawlik, K., & Melnyk, B. (2022). Psychometric Properties of the New Working Parent Burnout Scale. *Journal of Pediatric Health Care*.
- **What it measures:** Burnout specifically in working parents (combines parenting + work strain).
- **Items:** 10 items, including 2 reverse-scored
- **Validation:** N = 1,285 parents with children <18. Cronbach's alpha = 0.90.
- **Scoring:** 0–10 = few signs; 11–20 = mild; 21–30 = moderate; 31+ = severe
- **Status:** Newer, US-developed. Interesting because it's shorter and uses simple cutoff bands rather than clinical thresholds.

### 5. BR2 (Balance Between Risks and Resources) Instrument
- **Citation:** Mikolajczak, M., & Roskam, I. (2018). A Theoretical and Clinical Framework for Parental Burnout: The Balance Between Risks and Resources (BR2). *Frontiers in Psychology*, 9, 886.
- **What it measures:** Not burnout directly — measures the risk/resource balance that predicts burnout. Bipolar items range from -5 (risk) to +5 (resource).
- **Validation:** Longitudinal study on N = 923 parents. Strong linear relationship between BR2 score and parental burnout.
- **Status:** Theoretically the most relevant model for a "battery level" metaphor — it literally measures whether you're draining faster than you're recharging.

## Domains/Factors Identified

### PBA's Four Factors (current consensus)

| Factor | Items | Alpha | Description |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Exhaustion in parental role | 9 | 0.93 | Physical and emotional depletion from parenting duties |
| Contrast with previous parental self | 6 | 0.94 | "I'm not the parent I used to be / wanted to be" |
| Feelings of being fed up | 5 | 0.91 | Can't stand the parenting role anymore, desire to escape |
| Emotional distancing from children | 3 | 0.77 | Autopilot parenting, going through motions, disengagement |

### Key distinction from job burnout
- Job burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, reduced accomplishment (Maslach)
- Parental burnout replaces "depersonalization" with "emotional distancing" (you can't depersonalize your child the way you might a client) and adds "contrast with previous self" (unique to parenting identity)

### BR2 Risk/Resource Categories (Bronfenbrenner ecological model)
- **Individual:** Perfectionism, emotional intelligence, self-compassion, neuroticism, coping style
- **Parenting practices:** Childrearing quality, parental load/duties
- **Relationship:** Coparenting quality, marital satisfaction, partner support
- **External support:** Social network, community, practical help
- **Cultural:** Individualism vs. collectivism (strongest macro-level predictor — individualistic Western countries have dramatically higher burnout rates)

### Risk Factors (from 2024 systematic review, 26 studies)
- Neuroticism, perfectionism, low self-esteem, high need for control
- Alexithymia (inability to identify/express emotions), anxiety, depression
- Low income, low education
- Multiple children, younger children, child illness/behavioral problems
- Emotion-focused coping (avoidance), poor parent-child relationship
- Marital dissatisfaction, lack of coparental support
- Individualistic cultural values

### Protective Factors
- Self-compassion, resilience, agreeableness, conscientiousness
- Autonomous parental motivation (wanting to parent vs. feeling obligated)
- Problem-focused coping
- Social support, positive coparenting
- Collectivist/community child-rearing orientation

## Item Types & Response Formats

### PBA / PBI Response Scale
7-point frequency scale:
- 0 = Never
- 1 = A few times a year or less
- 2 = Once a month or less
- 3 = A few times a month
- 4 = Once a week
- 5 = A few times a week
- 6 = Every day

Total PBA score = sum of all 23 items (range 0–138).

### Working Parent Burnout Scale
5-point scale (0–4), 10 items. Simple sum with cutoff bands.

### BR2 Instrument
Bipolar items from -5 (endorsing risk pole) to +5 (endorsing resource pole), with 0 = neutral. Arithmetic sum reflects overall balance.

### Item Phrasing Pattern
All PBA items are first-person statements about parental experience. They avoid clinical jargon. Examples of stem patterns:
- "I feel..." (exhaustion items)
- "I have the sense that..." / "I have the impression that..."
- "I'm no longer able to..."
- "I don't think I'm..."
- "I do what I'm supposed to... but nothing more"

## Key Items We Can Adapt

### Published/Confirmed PBA Items (from validation paper and online implementations)

**Exhaustion dimension:**
1. "I feel completely run down by my role as a parent"
2. "I have the sense that I'm really worn out as a parent"
3. "I'm so tired out by my role as a parent that sleeping doesn't seem like enough"
4. "When I get up in the morning and have to face another day with my child(ren), I feel exhausted before I've even started"
5. "I find it exhausting just thinking of everything I have to do for my child(ren)"
6. "I have zero energy for looking after my child(ren)"
7. "My role as a parent uses up all my resources"

**Autopilot/survival items:**
8. "I sometimes have the impression that I'm looking after my child(ren) on autopilot"
9. "I'm in survival mode in my role as a parent"

**Contrast with previous self:**
- "I don't think I'm the good father/mother that I used to be"
- "I have the impression that I'm not myself anymore when I'm interacting with my child(ren)"

**Being fed up:**
- "I can't stand my role as father/mother any more"

**Emotional distancing:**
- "I do what I'm supposed to do for my child(ren), but nothing more"
- "I'm no longer able to show my child(ren) how much I love them"
- "I don't enjoy being with my child(ren)"
- "Outside the usual routines, I'm no longer able to make an effort"

### Working Parent Burnout Scale — Known Items
- "I find joy in parenting my children" (reverse-scored)
- "I get/feel easily irritated with my children"

## Gaps

### Our angle is "battery level" not clinical burnout — how to adapt?

**1. Spectrum, not diagnosis.** Clinical instruments are designed to identify pathological burnout (PBA cutoff >86 out of 138). Our quiz needs to measure the full spectrum from "fully charged" through "running low" to "critically drained." The PBA items cluster at the severe end — there's nothing that captures "I'm managing but it's taking a lot out of me" or "I have energy for the important stuff but not the extras."

**2. Battery metaphor maps well to BR2 model.** The BR2 framework (risks vs. resources balance) is almost exactly the "battery" concept: are you draining faster than you're recharging? The BR2 uses bipolar items (-5 to +5) which naturally capture both ends. This is closer to what we need than the PBA's purely-negative symptom checklist.

**3. Missing from existing instruments:**
- **Positive pole items.** PBA items are all deficit-focused. A "battery level" instrument needs items that capture the charged state: feeling present, patient, creative, enjoying parenting, bouncing back from hard moments. The only positive items are the PBI's reverse-scored "personal accomplishment" items, and even those are about competence, not energy.
- **Recovery/recharge capacity.** No instrument measures whether parents are effectively recharging — do they have time for themselves, sleep adequacy, whether breaks actually restore them.
- **Situational variability.** PBA uses frequency anchors (never to every day). Battery level fluctuates within a day. An ESM (experience sampling) version of the PBA exists but isn't practical for a quiz.
- **Non-pathologizing framing.** Clinical items like "I can't stand my role as parent anymore" are valid for diagnosis but will alienate parents who are depleted but not in crisis. We need items that validate the "running on fumes" state without implying they're bad parents.

**4. Age-of-child sensitivity.** Burnout manifests differently with an infant (sleep deprivation, physical depletion) vs. a toddler (emotional regulation drain) vs. a teen (conflict exhaustion). The PBA treats these uniformly. A battery quiz could acknowledge this.

**5. Cultural sensitivity for our audience.** The 42-country study showed individualistic Western parents have higher burnout. Our audience IS that population. The items should acknowledge the "solo operator" reality without normalizing the lack of support.

## Recommended Approach

### 1. Use the BR2 balance model as the theoretical foundation
The battery metaphor IS the BR2 model: demands drain, resources recharge, current level = balance. This gives us scientific backing for the metaphor and lets us measure both sides of the equation.

### 2. Build items across the full spectrum, not just the burnout end
Create items that map to battery levels:
- **Full charge (80–100%):** Present, patient, creative parenting, bouncing back quickly, enjoying even hard moments
- **Adequate (50–80%):** Managing the routine, sometimes snapping, choosing battles, occasionally on autopilot
- **Running low (20–50%):** Frequently exhausted, emotional distancing starting, surviving not thriving, dreading parts of the day
- **Critical (0–20%):** Full PBA-level burnout symptoms: can't stand it, escape ideation, zero energy, not the parent I want to be

### 3. Adapt the PBA's four dimensions but reframe positively
- **Energy** (from exhaustion): "After putting the kids to bed, I still have energy for myself" → "Putting the kids to bed takes everything I have"
- **Connection** (from emotional distancing): "I feel genuinely curious about my child's inner world" → "I'm going through the motions"
- **Identity** (from contrast with previous self): "I feel like myself as a parent" → "I don't recognize myself anymore"
- **Engagement** (from being fed up): "I look forward to parts of the parenting day" → "I can't take one more day of this"

### 4. Add a recovery/recharge dimension (novel)
This is not in any existing instrument but directly serves the battery metaphor:
- Are you getting enough sleep?
- Do you have time that's truly yours?
- Can you ask for and receive help?
- After a break, do you actually feel restored?

### 5. Keep it at 10–12 items
The BPBS proves 5 items can screen effectively. The WPBS uses 10. For a "battery level" quiz that covers 5 dimensions (energy, connection, identity, engagement, recharge), 10–12 items (2 per dimension + 2 recovery items) is the right range.

### 6. Use a frequency-based response scale
The PBA's 7-point frequency scale (never → every day) is well-validated and intuitive. Simplify to 5 points for a quiz context:
- Never / Rarely / Sometimes / Often / Almost always

### 7. Score as a battery percentage
Map total score to a 0–100% "battery level" with four zones. Avoid clinical language entirely. Frame results as:
- Green (75–100%): Charged
- Yellow (50–74%): Drawing down
- Orange (25–49%): Running low
- Red (0–24%): Critically drained

## Prevalence Data (for result page context)

- ~5% of parents in general population meet clinical burnout criteria (European studies)
- 0–8% range across 42 countries; higher in individualistic Western cultures
- ~9% estimated US prevalence using clinical cutoffs
- 57–65% of US parents self-report burnout symptoms (broader self-report measures, 2023 Ohio State data)
- Mothers score significantly higher than fathers even when parenting involvement is equal
- Consequences of clinical burnout: escape ideation, child neglect, parental violence (Mikolajczak, 2019 — explains 4x–25x more variance in these outcomes than job burnout)
