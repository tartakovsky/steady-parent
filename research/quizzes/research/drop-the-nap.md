## Domains/Factors Identified

Research breaks nap readiness/transition into the following dimensions:

### 1. Sleep Pattern Indicators (behavioral/observable)
- **Nap latency**: How long it takes the child to fall asleep at naptime (>30 min = sign of readiness)
- **Nap frequency**: Days per week the child actually sleeps during nap opportunity
- **Nap refusal/resistance**: Consistently not falling asleep during scheduled nap time
- **Nighttime sleep disruption**: Naps pushing bedtime later, longer sleep onset at night, or early morning waking
- **Total sleep duration**: Whether 24-hour sleep needs are met without naps

### 2. Daytime Functioning Without Naps (the critical domain)
- **Mood stability**: Remains content and regulated through late afternoon/evening on no-nap days
- **Behavioral regulation**: No increase in tantrums, irritability, or meltdowns without nap
- **Cognitive engagement**: Maintains attention, problem-solving, and self-regulation (Berger et al., 2012 found nap-deprived toddlers showed decreased skepticism, increased physical self-soothing, and less mature coping strategies)
- **Energy level**: Sustained activity without crashing or "second wind" dysregulation

### 3. Biological/Developmental Maturation
- **Circadian timing**: Napping toddlers show 38 min later melatonin onset than non-nappers (Akacem et al., 2015)
- **Homeostatic sleep pressure**: Ability to sustain wakefulness without excessive sleep pressure build-up
- **Age**: Most children transition between 2.5-5 years (median ~3.5 years); <2.5% before age 2, 94% by age 5
- **Sex**: Females tend toward earlier nap cessation
- **Cognitive development**: Higher cognitive scores correlate with earlier nap cessation

### 4. Consistency/Pattern (temporal stability)
- **Duration of pattern**: Signs present for 5+ consecutive days or most days over 2 weeks (clinical recommendation)
- **Nap pattern type**: Regular napper, intermittent napper, spontaneous napper, or non-napper (Bastien et al., 2023 latent profile analysis)
- **Proportion of spontaneous vs. scheduled naps**: Higher spontaneous proportion = less biological need

### 5. Contextual/Environmental Factors
- **Parental beliefs**: Parents' positive/negative beliefs about napping predict nap behavior
- **Childcare setting**: Daycare attendance correlates with earlier cessation
- **Family functioning**: Stable, predictable family environments support flexible nap approaches
- **Sibling presence**: Having older siblings predicts earlier nap cessation

## Item Types & Response Formats

### How validated instruments ask questions

**Frequency scales (most common for sleep behaviors):**
- CSHQ uses 3-point: "usually" (5-7x/week), "sometimes" (2-4x/week), "rarely" (0-1x/week)
- Recall period: "during the past week" or "typical week"

**Likert agreement scales (for beliefs/perceptions):**
- PNBS uses 5-point: "completely disagree" to "completely agree"
- RCNS uses 5-point: "not at all true" to "completely true"

**Duration/count items (for sleep timing):**
- BISQ-R: "How many naps does your child take?" (count)
- BISQ-R: "How much total time does your child spend sleeping during the day?" (duration estimate)
- Sleep diaries: exact timing records

**Binary/yes-no (for screening):**
- TCSQ item 10: "Do you consider your child has difficulties with sleep?" (yes/no)
- BEARS trigger questions are open-ended: "Does your child have any problems going to bed?"

**Age-customized stems:**
- PNBS: "Children who are [age range] years old..." to anchor developmental expectations

**Conditional/branching:**
- CSHQ Daytime Sleepiness: rates sleepiness during specific activities (playing, TV, car rides) from "not sleepy" to "very sleepy" to "falls asleep"

---

## Key Items We Can Adapt

### From CSHQ Daytime Sleepiness Subscale
- "Child naps during the day" (frequency)
- "Child seems tired" (frequency)
- "Child suddenly falls asleep in the middle of active behavior" (frequency)
- Activity-specific sleepiness: playing alone, watching TV, riding in car

### From BISQ-R
- Number of naps per day (quantitative)
- Total daytime sleep duration (quantitative)

### From RCNS (Reasons Children Nap Scale) — adaptable as readiness indicators
- "I would discourage my child from napping if... my child functions well without a nap"
- "I would discourage my child from napping if... my child prefers not to nap"
- "I would discourage my child from napping if... napping interferes with bedtime"

### From PNBS — beliefs that frame the decision
- Beliefs about developmental appropriateness of napping at this age
- Beliefs about behavioral consequences of skipping naps

### From Clinical Literature (Cleveland Clinic, Sleep Foundation consensus)
- "Does your child take longer than 30 minutes to fall asleep at naptime?"
- "Does your child consistently skip naps but remain cheerful/not cranky?"
- "Is your child's bedtime being pushed later because of napping?"
- "Is your child waking earlier in the morning than usual?"
- "Has this pattern been consistent for at least 5 days / 2 weeks?"

### From Self-Regulation Research (Berger et al., 2012)
- "On days without a nap, does your child become more easily frustrated than usual?"
- "On days without a nap, does your child have difficulty solving problems or focusing?"
- "On days without a nap, does your child use more physical comfort-seeking (thumb-sucking, blanket clutching)?"

### From Circadian Research (Akacem et al., 2015)
- "On nap days, does your child have difficulty falling asleep at their usual bedtime?"
- "Does your child seem fully alert and energetic past their usual bedtime on nap days?"

## Gaps

### What exists:
- Well-validated instruments for general pediatric sleep problems (CSHQ, BISQ-R, TCSQ)
- A new (2024) instrument for parental nap beliefs and reasons (PNBS/RCNS)
- Substantial research on nap cessation predictors (age, sex, sibling status, childcare)
- Clear clinical consensus on behavioral signs of readiness (5+ day consistency)
- Strong experimental evidence on what nap deprivation does to toddler cognition/regulation

### What does NOT exist:
- **No validated "nap readiness" assessment instrument.** This is a clear gap. No psychometric tool specifically asks "is this child ready to drop the nap?" and produces a validated score.
- **No established cutoff scores** for any existing instrument that map to "ready/not ready/transitioning"
- **No longitudinal validation** of a set of readiness indicators predicting successful nap cessation
- **Limited integration** of behavioral, circadian, and cognitive domains into a single assessment
- **No parent-facing tool** that synthesizes the research into actionable guidance; existing instruments are clinician-administered or research-focused

### What we need to build:
A parent-facing quiz that combines: (a) observable sleep pattern changes, (b) daytime functioning indicators, (c) consistency/duration of the pattern, and (d) age/developmental context into a readiness assessment. This tool would be novel -- no validated equivalent exists.

## Recommended Approach

### Quiz Structure

**Target:** Parents of children aged ~2-5 years wondering if their child is ready to stop napping.

**Output categories (3-tier):**
1. **Not yet ready** — still needs the nap (biological/behavioral indicators still strong)
2. **In transition** — showing mixed signals, may benefit from quiet time approach
3. **Ready to drop** — consistent pattern across multiple domains

### Recommended Domains (5, based on research synthesis)

**Domain 1: Naptime Behavior (3-4 items)**
Adapted from: CSHQ, BISQ-R, clinical literature
- How often does your child actually fall asleep during naptime?
- How long does it take your child to fall asleep at naptime?
- What does your child do during scheduled naptime? (plays/rests quietly/sleeps)

**Domain 2: Nighttime Sleep Impact (3-4 items)**
Adapted from: CSHQ Bedtime Resistance & Sleep Onset Delay, TCSQ, circadian research
- On nap days, does your child have trouble falling asleep at bedtime?
- Has your child's bedtime been getting pushed later?
- Is your child waking earlier in the morning than before?

**Domain 3: Daytime Functioning Without Naps (3-4 items)**
Adapted from: CSHQ Daytime Sleepiness, self-regulation research (Berger et al.)
- On days without a nap, how is your child's mood in the late afternoon/evening?
- On no-nap days, does your child seem more easily frustrated or have more meltdowns?
- Does your child fall asleep unexpectedly (in the car, during play)?

**Domain 4: Pattern Consistency (2-3 items)**
Adapted from: clinical guidelines, nap pattern research (Bastien et al.)
- How many days per week is your child showing these changes?
- How long has this pattern been going on?
- Are the changes happening on both weekdays and weekends?

**Domain 5: Age & Context (2-3 items, for weighting/interpretation)**
Adapted from: nap cessation predictors research
- Child's age (in months or half-year bands)
- Childcare arrangement (home vs. daycare, as daycare nap policies affect interpretation)
- Presence of older siblings

### Response Format Recommendation
- Use **4-point frequency scale** for behavioral items: "Almost never" / "Sometimes (1-2 days/week)" / "Often (3-4 days/week)" / "Almost every day" -- avoids the middle-point ambiguity of 5-point scales while providing more granularity than CSHQ's 3-point
- Use **duration choices** for timing items: "<15 min" / "15-30 min" / "30-45 min" / ">45 min"
- Use **age-in-months dropdown** for age (precision matters in this window)
- Total: ~14-16 items (completable in 2-3 minutes)

### Scoring Approach
- Weight Domain 3 (daytime functioning) most heavily -- this is the strongest research-backed indicator of biological readiness vs. mere schedule resistance
- Domain 4 (consistency) as a confidence modifier -- inconsistent patterns suggest transition phase
- Domain 5 (age/context) as a calibration layer -- very young children (<2.5) with apparent signs need flagging
- Flag for "too early" if child is under ~2.5 years with strong drop signals (rare, <2.5% of children)
- Flag for concern if child shows excessive daytime sleepiness without napping (could indicate sleep disorder, not readiness)

### Important Caveats to Include in Results
- Napping is biologically normal up to age 7 in some children
- Premature nap cessation correlates with worse behavioral outcomes (externalizing, peer problems)
- Transition period is normal and can last months -- not a binary switch
- "Quiet time" is a valid middle ground during transition
- If child shows excessive daytime sleepiness, irritability, or mood crashes without naps, the nap is still needed regardless of other signs
