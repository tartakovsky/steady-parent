# Age-Appropriate Chores — Instrument Research

## Validated Instruments Found

### 1. CHORES (Children Helping Out: Responsibilities, Expectations, and Supports)
- **What it measures:** School-aged children's (6-14) participation in household tasks — both performance (does the child do it?) and assistance level (how much help do they need?)
- **Structure:** 34 items across two subscales: Self-Care (13 items — tasks affecting only the child, e.g., getting dressed, making own bed, making self a meal) and Family Care (21 items — tasks affecting family/household, e.g., setting the table, cleaning, making someone else a meal)
- **Scoring:** Dual scoring per item: (a) dichotomous yes/no for performance, (b) 6-point Likert for assistance level (6=own initiative, 5=verbal suggestion, 4=supervision, 3=some help, 2=a lot of help, 1=unable, 0=not expected)
- **Psychometrics:** Test-retest ICC=0.93-0.94, internal consistency r=0.93-0.94, Self-Care alpha=0.96, Family Care alpha=0.98. Rasch analysis confirmed the two-factor structure. Validated with culturally diverse sample including children with and without disabilities.
- **Developer:** Dunn (2004), published in Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy and AJOT
- **Key strength for us:** The assistance-level Likert scale directly maps to "how much support does your child need" — the core concept we want to assess. The self-care vs. family-care distinction is a clean domain split.

### 2. Child Routines Questionnaire (CRQ)
- **What it measures:** Regularity and consistency of child routines in daily living (ages 6-12)
- **Structure:** 36-item parent report with four subscales: Daily Living Routines (11 items), Household Responsibilities (9 items), Discipline Routines (11 items), Homework Routines (5 items)
- **Scoring:** Frequency-based rating
- **Psychometrics:** Total alpha=0.90, subscale alphas 0.79-0.83, test-retest r=0.75-0.86
- **Preschool version (CRQ:P)** also exists with good reliability
- **Key strength for us:** The Household Responsibilities subscale (9 items) covers chores, personal responsibilities, and hygiene as a distinct construct. The routines framing is useful — it measures whether chores are a consistent part of life, not just whether the child *can* do them.

### 3. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3)
- **What it measures:** Adaptive behavior across communication, daily living skills, socialization, and motor skills (birth through adulthood)
- **Daily Living Skills domain** has three subdomains: Personal (eating, dressing, washing, hygiene, health care), Domestic (household tasks, chores, food preparation), Community (safety, money, travel)
- **Scoring:** 3-point scale per item: 2=usually performed, 1=sometimes/partly performed, 0=never performed. Items arranged in developmental order.
- **Key strength for us:** The Domestic subdomain is the closest clinical analog to what we're building. The developmental ordering of items provides an empirical age-progression sequence. The Personal subdomain covers self-care prerequisites.

### 4. ABAS-3 (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Third Edition)
- **What it measures:** Functional skills individuals perform daily without help (birth through 89 years)
- **Relevant skill areas:** Self-Care, Home Living (within the Practical composite domain)
- **Scoring:** 4-point frequency scale — whether individual can perform the activity and how often they do it when needed
- **Key strength for us:** The Self-Care and Home Living skill areas together cover the same territory we're targeting. The "can do AND does do" distinction is important — a child may be capable but not yet given the opportunity.

### 5. PEDI / PEDI-CAT (Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory)
- **What it measures:** Functional skills, level of independence, and extent of modifications needed (6 months to 7 years; PEDI-CAT extends to age 20)
- **Self-Care domain:** 73 items covering feeding, dressing, bathing, toileting, grooming
- **Scoring:** Capability (can/cannot) + Caregiver Assistance scale (independent to total assistance)
- **Key strength for us:** The dual scoring of capability vs. caregiver assistance is the same conceptual split as the CHORES measure. The 73-item self-care domain provides a deep item pool to draw from for younger children.

### 6. WeeFIM (Functional Independence Measure for Children)
- **What it measures:** Functional independence in essential daily skills (6 months to 7 years; up to 21 for developmental disabilities)
- **Self-Care domain:** 8 items (eating, grooming, bathing, dressing-upper, dressing-lower, toileting, bladder management, bowel management)
- **Scoring:** 7-point ordinal scale: 7=complete independence, 6=modified independence (device/extra time), 5=supervision/setup, 4=minimal assist (>75% effort), 3=moderate assist (50-74%), 2=maximal assist (25-49%), 1=total assistance
- **Key strength for us:** The 7-point independence gradient is the gold standard for measuring "how much help." The scale from total assistance through supervision to full independence maps directly to what parents intuitively understand.


## Domains/Factors Identified

From cross-referencing all instruments and developmental guidelines, six distinct domains emerge:

### Domain 1: Self-Care / Personal Care
Tasks that serve the child's own needs. Subdivides by developmental progression:
- **Feeding/eating** — bottle > finger foods > spoon > fork/knife > preparing own snack > cooking simple meal
- **Dressing** — cooperates > removes simple items > dresses self > manages fasteners > selects appropriate clothing
- **Hygiene** — tolerates washing > washes hands > brushes teeth > bathes self > manages all grooming independently
- **Toileting** — signals need > daytime control > independent toileting > nighttime dryness > public restroom independence

### Domain 2: Household Maintenance / Domestic Tasks
Tasks that serve the family/home. Progression:
- **Tidying** — puts away own toys > tidies own room > tidies shared spaces > organizes storage
- **Cleaning** — wipes up spills > wipes surfaces > sweeps > vacuums > cleans bathroom/kitchen
- **Laundry** — puts clothes in hamper > sorts > loads washer > folds > puts away > complete laundry cycle
- **Meal support** — clears own plate > sets/clears table > helps prep food > packs lunch > cooks simple meal with supervision

### Domain 3: Pet/Plant/Sibling Care (Care of Others)
Responsibility for living things beyond self:
- Waters plants > feeds pet > walks pet > helps with younger sibling (supervised) > babysits (age 12+)

### Domain 4: External/Community Responsibility
Tasks extending beyond the home:
- Gets mail > helps with yard work > carries groceries > runs simple errands > shops independently

### Domain 5: Motor Readiness (Prerequisite)
Not a chore domain itself, but the developmental foundation:
- **Fine motor:** Grip strength, bilateral coordination (needed for buttoning, pouring, cutting food)
- **Gross motor:** Carrying, bending, reaching, sustained standing (needed for sweeping, yard work)
- **Sequencing/executive function:** Planning multi-step tasks, remembering routines, task-switching

### Domain 6: Supervision/Independence Level (Cross-cutting)
This is NOT a separate task domain — it's a dimension that applies to every task:
- Total assistance > maximal help > moderate help > minimal help > supervision only > verbal prompt > own initiative
- This is the WeeFIM/CHORES gradient, and it's the most informative axis for a parent-facing quiz


## Item Types & Response Formats

### Response formats used across instruments:

| Format | Used by | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| **Dichotomous (yes/no)** | CHORES (performance) | Whether child does the task at all |
| **3-point capability** | Vineland-3 (2/1/0) | Usually / sometimes / never performs |
| **4-point frequency** | ABAS-3 | Can do it + how often when needed |
| **6-point assistance** | CHORES (assistance) | Own initiative through unable |
| **7-point independence** | WeeFIM | Complete independence through total assistance |
| **Age-gated checklist** | AACAP, AAP, Montessori | Binary "can/expected to do at this age" |

### What works best for a parent-facing quiz:

The **6-point CHORES assistance scale** is the most actionable for parents. It answers the question parents actually have: "Is my child doing what they should be doing, and how much am I still helping?"

A good hybrid: present **age-filtered task items** (so parents aren't rating tasks irrelevant to their child's age), with a **simplified 4-5 point independence scale** per item (e.g., "Does it independently / Needs a reminder / Needs some help / Needs a lot of help / Not yet doing this").


## Key Items We Can Adapt

### From CHORES (Self-Care subscale, adapted):
- Gets dressed without help (including fasteners appropriate to age)
- Makes own bed
- Puts dirty clothes in hamper
- Prepares a simple snack or meal
- Cleans up own space after playing
- Manages own hygiene routine (teeth, hair, bathing)

### From CHORES (Family-Care subscale, adapted):
- Sets or clears the table
- Helps with meal preparation
- Takes out garbage/recycling
- Feeds or waters a pet
- Wipes counters/tables after meals
- Puts away groceries
- Sweeps or vacuums a room
- Helps with laundry (sorting, folding, putting away)

### From AACAP/AAP age guidelines (age-gated):
- **2-3 years:** Puts toys away, helps put groceries away, dresses self with help
- **4-5 years:** Makes bed (imperfectly), feeds pet, clears table, waters plants
- **5-7 years:** Packs school lunch, empties wastebaskets, sorts laundry, dusts
- **8-10 years:** Loads/unloads dishwasher, helps make dinner, puts away own laundry, walks pet
- **10-12 years:** Changes sheets, cleans bathroom/kitchen, does laundry start to finish, cooks simple meal with supervision
- **12+ years:** Watches younger siblings, shops for groceries, runs errands, washes car

### From Vineland-3 / WeeFIM (developmental self-care progression):
- Feeds self with utensils (by ~2)
- Removes simple clothing (by ~18 months)
- Indicates toileting needs (by ~2-3)
- Dresses independently except fasteners (by ~3-4)
- Independent toileting (by ~3-4)
- Ties shoes (by ~5-6)
- Selects appropriate clothing (by ~7-9)
- Complete bathing/grooming independence (by ~8-10)

### From Rossmann longitudinal research (framing items):
- Items about whether chores are a regular/consistent part of the child's routine (not just one-offs)
- Items about whether parent assigns chores or child initiates
- Items about age at which regular chore participation began


## Gaps

### 1. No single validated instrument covers the full 2-13+ age range with household chores
- CHORES covers 6-14 but misses toddlers/preschoolers
- PEDI/WeeFIM cover young children but focus on self-care, not household contribution
- CRQ covers routines but the Household Responsibilities subscale is only 9 items
- **Implication:** We need to build a hybrid that uses age-gating to present appropriate items

### 2. Montessori frameworks are practice-based, not psychometrically validated
- Rich task progressions by age, but no reliability/validity data
- Represent expert/pedagogical consensus rather than empirical norms
- **Implication:** Useful for item generation and face validity, not for claiming "validated" scoring

### 3. Cultural variation in chore expectations is significant but poorly measured
- CHORES was validated with a diverse US sample, but norms are not stratified by culture
- What's "age appropriate" varies substantially across cultures (e.g., cooking age, childcare responsibility)
- **Implication:** Our quiz should frame results as developmental readiness ("your child is capable of...") rather than normative judgment ("your child should be doing...")

### 4. Parental opportunity vs. child capability is confounded
- Most instruments measure what children DO, not what they CAN do
- A child may be developmentally capable but never given the chance
- ABAS-3 acknowledges this ("can do AND does do") but most others don't
- **Implication:** We should include at least one item about whether the child has been given the opportunity, or frame items as "does your child do X, with or without prompting"

### 5. No validated quiz specifically designed for "what chores should I give my kid"
- All instruments found are clinical/research tools, not parent-guidance tools
- The AACAP/AAP age lists are expert guidelines, not assessment instruments
- **Implication:** We are building something novel — a parent-facing assessment informed by clinical instruments but designed for practical guidance. We should be transparent about this.

### 6. Executive function / self-regulation as a prerequisite is underrepresented
- Research shows chores require planning, task-switching, and remembering instructions
- No chore-specific instrument measures whether the child has the executive function capacity for a given chore
- **Implication:** We may want 1-2 items about the child's ability to follow multi-step instructions or complete tasks without constant redirection


## Recommended Approach

### Structure
Build an age-gated assessment with three layers:

1. **Age input** (child's age in years) — used to filter which task items are presented and to set developmental expectations for scoring

2. **Task independence items** (8-12 items, dynamically selected based on age):
   - Each item presents a specific household task appropriate for the child's age bracket
   - Response scale: 5-point independence gradient adapted from CHORES/WeeFIM:
     - **Does it on their own** (maps to WeeFIM 7, CHORES 6)
     - **Does it with a reminder** (maps to WeeFIM 5-6, CHORES 5)
     - **Does it with some help** (maps to WeeFIM 3-4, CHORES 3-4)
     - **Needs a lot of help** (maps to WeeFIM 1-2, CHORES 1-2)
     - **Not doing this yet** (maps to CHORES 0)
   - Items should span self-care AND household contribution for the age bracket
   - Include at least 2-3 items at the "stretch" level (next age bracket up) to identify growth edges

3. **Context items** (2-3 items):
   - "Does your child have regular, assigned household responsibilities?" (Yes/No/Sometimes) — drawn from CRQ routines concept and Rossmann research
   - "When your child struggles with a task, what do you usually do?" (step in and do it / help them through it / let them figure it out / depends on the task) — captures parental scaffolding style
   - Optional: "At what age did your child start having regular chores?" — drawn from Rossmann finding that starting at 3-4 is the strongest predictor

### Scoring Model
- **Primary output:** Independence profile — where the child falls on the assistance gradient across self-care and household domains
- **Secondary output:** Readiness assessment — which tasks the child is developmentally ready for based on age + current independence level
- **Tertiary output:** Growth recommendations — 2-3 specific next-step tasks the child could take on, drawn from the next developmental tier

### What NOT to do
- Do not produce a single "score" or "percentile" — we don't have normative data for that, and it would feel judgmental
- Do not frame results as "behind" or "ahead" — frame as "ready for" and "building toward"
- Do not include clinical self-care items (toileting, bathing) for children over ~6, as these become private/sensitive and are expected to be mastered — focus on household contribution instead

### Item Pool Strategy
- Create 30-40 items total spanning ages 2-13+
- Each age bracket (2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-10, 11-13) gets ~8-10 relevant items
- Quiz dynamically selects 8-12 based on child's age
- Items drawn from AACAP/AAP guidelines (face validity), mapped against CHORES subscales (construct validity), and ordered by Vineland/WeeFIM developmental progressions (developmental validity)
