# Screen Dependence -- Instrument Research

## Validated Instruments Found

### 1. ScreenQ (Hutton et al., 2020)
- **What it measures:** Composite adherence to AAP screen media recommendations across 4 domains: access, frequency, content, co-viewing
- **Items:** 15 items, scored 0-26 (higher = greater non-adherence)
- **Target age:** 3-5 years (parent report)
- **Key innovation:** Grounded directly in AAP clinical guidelines rather than arbitrary frequency cutoffs. Binary/ordinal scoring weighted by evidence of risk (e.g., bedroom access = 2 points because evidence of harm is strongest). Access subscale asks about device in bedroom, own device, use during meals, use on school nights, use while waiting. Co-viewing subscale captures whether media is viewed with adults vs. alone.
- **Psychometric quality:** Rasch-validated, rCo-alpha = 0.74. Correlated with lower executive function, language, literacy, and less stimulating home cognitive environment. Also correlated with reduced brain white matter integrity in MRI studies.
- **Citation:** Hutton JS et al. "A novel, composite measure of screen-based media use in young children (ScreenQ)." *Pediatric Research* 87, 2020. Also validated in Portuguese (Monteiro et al., 2022, *Acta Paediatrica*).

### 2. SCREENS-Q (Klakk et al., 2020)
- **What it measures:** Children's leisure-time screen media use AND its proximal correlates using a socio-ecological model (individual, social/interpersonal, physical/home environment)
- **Items:** 19 questions, 92 items across 6 domains
- **Target age:** 6-10 years (parent report)
- **Key innovation:** Most comprehensive validated tool. Goes far beyond "how much" to capture the full ecology: which devices, what context, who's present, early exposure age, parent's OWN screen habits, and parental perceptions (benefits, worries, rule conflicts). Built on socio-ecological framework rather than just measuring the child.
- **Six domains:**
  1. **Screen Media Environment** (7 questions, 39 items) -- device ownership, household availability, frequency, access during school, background TV
  2. **Child's Screen Media Use** (3 questions, 16 items) -- time by activity type (TV, games, homework, social media), timing (morning/bedtime), duration before/after school
  3. **Context of Screen Media Use** (2 questions, 2 items) -- multi-device use, who child is with (adult, friends, siblings, alone)
  4. **Early Exposure** (1 question, 2 items) -- age when child got own tablet/smartphone
  5. **Parental Perception of Child's Media Use** (1 question, 16 items) -- child preferences, perceived benefits (learning, calmness), worry about health impacts, rule-related conflict
  6. **Parental Media Use** (3 questions, 15 items) -- parent work-related screen time, parent leisure screen use by activity type
- **Psychometric quality:** Test-retest ICC 0.67-0.90 for continuous variables, kappa > 0.50 for all nominal/ordinal items (80%+ above 0.61).
- **Citation:** Klakk H et al. "The development of a questionnaire to assess leisure time screen-based media use and its proximal correlates in children (SCREENS-Q)." *BMC Public Health* 20, 2020.

### 3. MEPA-20 / Media Parenting Scale (Vacek et al., 2021)
- **What it measures:** Parental BEHAVIOR toward children's screen/media use -- not child habits, but how the parent mediates
- **Items:** 20 items, 3 subscales, 5-point Likert (1=totally untrue to 5=totally true)
- **Target age:** 6-10 years (parent self-report on own behavior)
- **Key innovation:** Distinguishes between effective and counter-effective parenting practices around screens. Most tools measure the child's consumption; this measures what the PARENT does about it. Identifies over-protective mediation as a distinct harmful pattern (secretly checking, near-total bans) separate from healthy restrictive mediation.
- **Three subscales:**
  1. **Active Mediation** (8 items) -- communication and guidance. Items like: "I chat with my child about time s/he spends using screens," "I explain which content is suitable," "I help my child find suitable situations for watching/using screens"
  2. **Restrictive Mediation** (8 items) -- rule-setting and monitoring. Items like: "We have agreed rules about screen time," "I notice what content my child consumes," "I do not let my child use screens in other than agreed situations"
  3. **Over-protective Mediation** (4 items) -- potentially harmful control. Items like: "I secretly check my child's screen activities," "I constantly check my child's screen activities," "We set rules which almost never allow children to use screens for entertainment"
- **Psychometric quality:** Active alpha = 0.77, Restrictive alpha = 0.73. Turkish validation confirmed cross-cultural validity.
- **Citation:** Vacek J et al. "Measuring Parental Behavior towards Children's Use of Media and Screen-Devices." *Int J Environ Res Public Health* 18(17), 2021.

### 4. DSEQ / Digital Screen Exposure Questionnaire (Kaur et al., 2021)
- **What it measures:** Comprehensive screen exposure including home media environment, physical activity displacement, media-related behaviors, and parental perceptions
- **Items:** 86 items across 5 domains
- **Target age:** 2-5 years (caregiver report)
- **Key innovation:** Captures the displacement effect -- measures physical activity and non-screen activities alongside screen exposure to show what screens are replacing, not just how much they're used. Also separates educational vs. non-educational content viewing and caretaker screen use patterns.
- **Five domains:**
  1. Sociodemographic characteristics (23 items)
  2. Screen-time exposure and home media environment (27 items) -- duration/frequency across TV, smartphone/tablet, computer; accessibility; media rules; caretaker screen use
  3. Level of physical activity (10 items) -- weekday/weekend outdoor activity
  4. Media-related behaviors (15 items) -- activities while viewing, content types (educational vs. non-educational)
  5. Parental media literacy (11 items) -- caregiver perceptions of positive/negative effects
- **Psychometric quality:** Kappa 0.52-1.0, ICC 0.62-0.99, Cronbach alpha 0.71-0.82 across domains.
- **Citation:** Kaur N et al. "Development and evaluation of the digital-screen exposure questionnaire (DSEQ)." *PLOS One* 16(6), 2021.

### 5. PMUM-SF / Problematic Media Use Measure -- Short Form (Domoff et al., 2019)
- **What it measures:** Dysregulated/addictive screen media use patterns in children, modeled on DSM-5 Internet Gaming Disorder criteria
- **Items:** 9 items, 5-point Likert (1=never to 5=always), mean score 1-5
- **Target age:** 4-11 years (parent report)
- **Key innovation:** Measures PROBLEMATIC use, not quantity. A child can have moderate screen time and still score high if the use is dysregulated. Captures addiction markers: preoccupation, unsuccessful control, loss of interest in other activities, psychosocial problems, mood regulation use, withdrawal, tolerance/deception. Critical finding: PMU is associated with emotional dysregulation and pestering behavior even in children with below-average screen time.
- **Example items:** "The amount of time my child wants to use screen media keeps increasing" (tolerance); "When my child has had a bad day, screen media seems to be the only thing that helps him/her feel better" (mood regulation)
- **Psychometric quality:** Alpha = 0.93 for short form. Validated in preschool-aged children as well.
- **Citation:** Domoff SE et al. "Development and Validation of the Problematic Media Use Measure." *Psychology of Popular Media Culture* 8(1), 2019.

### 6. PSUS / Parent Screen-Based Device Use Survey (2023)
- **What it measures:** How parents USE screens as a parenting tool -- screens as discipline, childcare, mood regulation, and parent's own self-regulation via devices
- **Items:** 31 items, 5-point Likert (never to often), 8 subscales
- **Target age:** Parents of young children (parent self-report)
- **Key innovation:** The only validated instrument that directly measures PARENT-DRIVEN screen use as a parenting strategy. Captures screens used as babysitter ("When my child is using a screen-based device, I can get a break from caregiving"), discipline tool (reward/punishment), and parent's own dysregulated device use as a factor in family screen patterns.
- **Eight subscales:**
  1. **Discipline** -- screen time as reward/punishment
  2. **Limit-Setting** -- establishing boundaries
  3. **Involvement** -- co-using devices with children
  4. **Child Care** -- screens as caregiving tools
  5. **Family Norms** -- SBD use as typical household activity
  6. **Self-Regulation** -- parent using screens for personal stress relief
  7. **Dysregulation** -- parent difficulty controlling own device use
  8. **Parenting Support** -- accessing parenting help via devices
- **Citation:** Published in *PMC* 2023 (article PMC10727494).

### 7. CAFE Toolkit / Comprehensive Assessment of Family Media Exposure (Barr et al., 2024)
- **What it measures:** Dynamic range of media use within the DREAMER (Dynamic, Relational, Ecological Approach to Media Effects Research) framework
- **Target:** Whole-family assessment across 12+ countries
- **Key innovation:** Shifts from "screen time" to "family media ecology." Assesses whether media is accessed in isolation or collaboratively, parent motivations for media use (educational tool vs. pacifier vs. joint engagement), and structural/contextual factors. Explicitly rejects simple duration metrics in favor of ecological assessment.

## Domains/Factors Identified

Across all instruments, screen dependence is NOT one thing. The validated research identifies these distinct dimensions:

### A. Access & Environment
- Device availability in household (how many, which types)
- Bedroom access (strongest predictor of overuse)
- Background media (TV on even when no one is watching)
- Age of first device ownership

### B. Quantity & Timing
- Total daily duration (weekday vs. weekend)
- Time of day (morning, mealtimes, bedtime -- each has different implications)
- Duration by device type (TV vs. tablet vs. phone)
- Duration by activity type (passive watching vs. interactive vs. educational)

### C. Content Quality
- Educational vs. entertainment vs. social media
- Age-appropriate content
- Fast-paced vs. slow-paced programming

### D. Context of Use
- Solo vs. co-viewing/co-using with adult
- Who initiates the screen session (parent vs. child)
- Multi-tasking/multi-device use
- Use during other activities (meals, car rides, waiting)

### E. Parental Mediation Style
- Active mediation (discussing, guiding, teaching)
- Restrictive mediation (rules, limits, monitoring)
- Over-protective mediation (secretly checking, near-total bans -- counterproductive)
- Risky permissive mediation (no interference, child knows best)

### F. Parent-Driven Functional Use
- Screens as babysitter/break (childcare function)
- Screens as mood regulation tool (calming tantrums, preventing meltdowns)
- Screens as discipline lever (reward/punishment)
- Screens as default for transitions (waiting rooms, restaurants, car)

### G. Parent's Own Screen Behavior
- Parent leisure screen time
- Parent work-related screen time
- Parent self-regulation via devices (stress scrolling)
- Parent dysregulated use (can't put phone down)

### H. Problematic Use Markers (in the child)
- Preoccupation (thinking about screens when not using them)
- Loss of control (can't stop when told)
- Tolerance (needs more to get same satisfaction)
- Withdrawal (distress when screens removed)
- Loss of interest in non-screen activities
- Mood regulation dependence (screens as only coping mechanism)
- Deception about use
- Conflict/negative consequences from use

### I. Displacement Effects
- Physical activity levels
- Independent play capacity
- Social interaction quality
- Sleep disruption
- Creative/imaginative play frequency


## Item Types & Response Formats

### What makes validated instruments BETTER than simple frequency scales:

**1. Situational/Contextual Items (SCREENS-Q, ScreenQ)**
Instead of "how much screen time," these ask WHEN and WHERE:
- "Does your child have a screen-based device in their bedroom?" (yes/no -- binary, high-weight)
- "Who is your child with during screen time?" (alone/sibling/friend/adult -- categorical)
- "Does your child use screens during meals?" (frequency scale)

**2. Functional Items (PSUS, SCREENS-Q)**
These ask WHY screens are being used:
- "When my child is using a screen-based device, I can get a break from caregiving" (Likert)
- Parental perception items about benefits: "Screens help my child calm down" (agreement scale)
- Rule conflict items: "We argue about screen time rules" (agreement scale)

**3. Behavioral Marker Items (PMUM-SF)**
These identify patterns that signal problematic use regardless of quantity:
- "The amount of time my child wants to use screen media keeps increasing" (tolerance)
- "My child's screen media use causes problems for the family" (consequences)
- Items use never/rarely/sometimes/often/always scale -- not hours

**4. Mediation Strategy Items (MEPA-20)**
These assess the parent's approach, not the child's consumption:
- "I chat with my child about time s/he spends using screens" (active)
- "We have agreed rules about screen time" (restrictive)
- "I secretly check my child's screen activities" (over-protective)

**5. Displacement/Alternative Items (DSEQ)**
These measure what screens are replacing:
- Physical activity duration alongside screen duration
- Types of non-screen activities available and used
- Educational vs. non-educational content split

**6. Ecological Items (SCREENS-Q, CAFE)**
These capture the broader system:
- Parent's own leisure screen time by activity type
- Number and type of devices in household
- Background TV frequency
- Early exposure age


## Key Items We Can Adapt

These item types specifically address the feedback that our quiz assumed child-driven use and missed parent-driven dynamics:

### Items that capture PARENT-DRIVEN screen use (the core complaint)

1. **"When you need to get something done (cooking, a work call, a shower), how often do you hand your child a screen?"**
   - Adapted from: PSUS Child Care subscale
   - Why it matters: Directly addresses screens-as-babysitter without judgment. Acknowledges parent NEED, not child demand.

2. **"When your child is melting down or dysregulated, how often is a screen the tool you reach for?"**
   - Adapted from: PSUS Discipline + PMUM mood regulation items
   - Why it matters: Captures screens as emotional regulation outsourcing -- the most clinically significant parent-driven pattern.

3. **"How often do screens come out during transitions -- waiting rooms, restaurants, car rides, grocery store?"**
   - Adapted from: ScreenQ access items (use while waiting) + SCREENS-Q context items
   - Why it matters: These are overwhelmingly parent-initiated. The child doesn't ask to watch iPad at the dentist -- the parent pre-loads it.

4. **"When your child says 'I'm bored,' which of these happens FIRST -- you suggest a screen, your child asks for one, or neither?"**
   - Adapted from: SCREENS-Q context + PSUS norms
   - Why it matters: Identifies the initiator. Most current quizzes assume the child is driving demand.

### Items that capture the HOME MEDIA ENVIRONMENT (ecological context)

5. **"Is a TV or screen usually on in the background in your home, even when no one is actively watching?"**
   - Adapted from: SCREENS-Q domain 1 (background TV)
   - Why it matters: Background media is a major exposure source that no one "chose" -- it's environmental, not behavioral.

6. **"Does your child have their own device, or do they use yours?"**
   - Adapted from: ScreenQ access items + SCREENS-Q early exposure domain
   - Why it matters: Own-device vs. shared-device families have completely different screen dynamics.

### Items that capture PARENTAL MEDIATION (what the parent does about screens)

7. **"When your child is watching something, how often are you watching/doing it with them vs. using it as alone time?"**
   - Adapted from: ScreenQ co-viewing domain + MEPA active mediation
   - Why it matters: Co-viewing transforms the screen experience. This item captures quality without asking about content.

8. **"Do you have explicit rules about when screens are/aren't allowed, or does it happen more organically?"**
   - Adapted from: MEPA restrictive mediation items
   - Why it matters: Rule presence/absence is a stronger predictor than total hours.

### Items that capture PROBLEMATIC PATTERNS (beyond quantity)

9. **"Has the amount of screen time your family uses gradually increased over the past 6 months without anyone deciding it should?"**
   - Adapted from: PMUM tolerance item
   - Why it matters: Creep is the universal pattern. Families don't choose high screen use -- it drifts there.

10. **"How hard would it be to do a screen-free Saturday? Think about it for the whole family, not just the kids."**
    - Adapted from: Current quiz Q9, but reframed to include parents
    - Why it matters: Original quiz asked only about child flexibility. The DREAMER framework says family media ecology means everyone.


## What Our Current Quiz Gets Wrong

Based on the validated instruments, our current quiz has several structural problems:

### 1. The domains assume child-driven use: "Child Screen Habits" as a domain

The validated research shows screen use in families with young children is overwhelmingly parent-initiated or parent-facilitated. The PSUS found that screens-as-childcare, screens-as-mood-regulation, and screens-as-discipline are the primary drivers. Our "Child Screen Habits" domain frames screens as something the CHILD does, when research shows it's something the PARENT deploys.

### 2. "Parent Modeling" is the wrong frame for parent screen behavior

Our Q4 and Q5 ask "how often are you on your phone" and "what's your default when waiting." These treat parent screen use as a modeling problem (child copies parent). The validated instruments show parent screen use matters in THREE distinct ways:
- **Modeling** (child imitates) -- what our quiz captures
- **Displacement** (parent on phone = less interaction with child) -- our quiz misses this
- **Functional use** (parent uses screens to manage the child) -- our quiz completely misses this, and this is the dominant pattern

### 3. "Screen-Free Alternatives" puts the burden on the child

Q6 asks "Can your child occupy themselves for 15-20 minutes without a screen?" and Q7 asks about the child saying "I'm bored." This frames the issue as the child lacking skills, when the research shows it's about whether the parent reaches for a screen before the child has a chance to be bored. The SCREENS-Q and PSUS both measure parent behavior as the primary driver, not child capacity.

### 4. "Transition Ease" measures a symptom, not a cause

Q8 (meltdowns when screens end) and Q9 (screen-free day difficulty) measure withdrawal symptoms of problematic use. The PMUM-SF shows these are valid markers, but they're LATE markers. By the time a child melts down when screens are removed, the pattern is entrenched. The validated instruments capture the UPSTREAM factors: access, environment, parental mediation, and functional use that create the dependence in the first place.

### 5. No ecological/environmental assessment

The SCREENS-Q, DSEQ, ScreenQ, and DREAMER/CAFE frameworks all emphasize that screen use is shaped by the home media environment -- number of devices, bedroom access, background TV, rules or lack thereof. Our quiz asks nothing about the physical and normative environment that enables or constrains screen use.

### 6. Three-option response format loses nuance

Most validated instruments use 4-5 point Likert scales or categorical responses with 4+ options. Our 3-option format (good/medium/bad) creates a forced choice that misses the meaningful middle ground where most families actually live.

### 7. No content quality dimension

ScreenQ, SCREENS-Q, and DSEQ all distinguish between content types. A child watching 2 hours of co-viewed educational content and a child watching 2 hours of solo YouTube autoplay are in fundamentally different situations. Our quiz treats all screen time as equivalent.

### 8. Missing the "creep" dynamic

The PMUM-SF tolerance item captures the universal experience of screen time gradually increasing without anyone deciding it should. No item in our current quiz captures this drift pattern, which is the most relatable experience for most parents.


## Recommended Approach

### Primary adaptation source: SCREENS-Q ecological model + PSUS functional use items

**Why SCREENS-Q:** It provides the most comprehensive validated framework and explicitly uses a socio-ecological model. It captures environment, child behavior, context, parental perception, and parental behavior as interconnected factors. This maps directly to the user complaint -- the quiz needs to see screen use as a family system, not a child behavior.

**Why PSUS:** It's the only validated instrument that directly measures parent-driven screen use as a parenting tool. This is the exact gap our user identified. Screens-as-babysitter, screens-as-mood-regulator, and screens-as-discipline are validated dimensions that no other instrument captures this clearly.

### Secondary sources:

- **PMUM-SF** for the problematic-use markers (tolerance, withdrawal, mood regulation dependence) -- these are our "transition ease" items done right
- **MEPA-20** for the mediation style items (active vs. restrictive vs. over-protective) -- this replaces our "parent modeling" domain with something more clinically useful
- **ScreenQ** for the access/environment items (bedroom device, mealtime screens, co-viewing) -- concise, well-weighted, AAP-grounded

### Suggested new domain structure (5 domains, ~12-15 items):

1. **Home Media Environment** (ScreenQ access + SCREENS-Q environment)
   - Device availability, bedroom access, background media, rules
2. **Why Screens Come Out** (PSUS functional use)
   - Parent-initiated use: childcare, mood regulation, transitions, discipline
3. **How Screens Are Used** (SCREENS-Q context + ScreenQ co-viewing + MEPA active mediation)
   - Solo vs. co-viewing, content quality, active discussion about content
4. **Signs of Dependence** (PMUM-SF markers)
   - Tolerance/creep, withdrawal reactions, mood regulation reliance, loss of interest in alternatives
5. **Family Screen Norms** (SCREENS-Q parent use + PSUS parent dysregulation + DREAMER ecology)
   - Parent's own screen patterns, screen-free zones/times, explicit rules vs. organic drift

### Key design principles from the research:

- Frame as FAMILY screen ecology, not child screen habits
- Acknowledge parent-driven use without judgment (PSUS does this well)
- Include at least one item where the parent assesses their OWN device dependence
- Distinguish between screen QUANTITY and screen QUALITY/CONTEXT
- Capture the environment (access, rules, norms) not just the behavior
- Use 4-point response scales minimum to capture meaningful gradation
- Include at least one "creep" / tolerance item -- it's the most universally relatable experience
