# Potty Training Readiness — Instrument Research

## Validated Instruments Found

### 1. Toilet Training Readiness Scale (TTRS)
- **Citation:** Yilmaz et al. (2024). "Toilet Training Readiness Scale for 0-5-Year-Old Children: A New Measurement Tool Based on a Child-Centred Approach." *Children*, 11(9), 1149. MDPI.
- **What it measures:** Child's physiological, cognitive, and psychological readiness for toilet training.
- **Items:** 10 binary (yes/no) items. Cut-off score of 6/10.
- **Psychometrics:** Content Validity Index = 1.0; Cronbach's alpha = 0.567 (low); Sensitivity 85.6%, Specificity 34.4% at cut-off of 6. N=409 children ages 0-60 months.
- **Notable:** Only formally validated readiness-specific instrument found. Low alpha and poor specificity are significant limitations — the scale catches most ready children but also flags many who aren't actually ready.

**TTRS Items (verbatim):**
1. My child may imitate other people's behaviour or actions
2. My child can stand or walk unaided
3. My child has enough language skills to explain that he/she needs to go to the toilet
4. My child can say "no" as a sign of independence
5. My child can understand and follow up simple commands
6. My child can pick up things on his/her own and put them back where they belong
7. My child has a tendency to and interested in using the toilet
8. My child gives a favourite object to a favourite person
9. My child can dress or undress on his/her own
10. My child feels uncomfortable after wetting/pooping him/herself or his/her nappy

### 2. Wyndaele-Kaerts Developmental Signs Checklist
- **Citation:** Wyndaele, Kaerts, Wyndaele & Vermandel (2020). "Development Signs in Healthy Toddlers in Different Stages of Toilet Training: Can They Help Define Readiness and Probability of Success?" *Global Pediatric Health*, 7.
- **What it measures:** 18 developmental signs observed in children at various toilet training stages.
- **Items:** 18 items assessed via 8-hour direct observation + parent questionnaire. Not a parent self-report instrument — researcher-administered.
- **Psychometrics:** Predictive model achieved 0.97 AUC with 88-92.5% accuracy in cross-validation. N=269 healthy toddlers (15-35 months) in daycare.
- **Notable:** Best predictive validity of any study found. Identified that 3 items had zero predictive value (sitting stable, picking up small objects, putting objects in containers). Strongest predictor: "expressing need and showing awareness to evacuate."

**Key predictive signs (ranked):**
1. Expressing need to evacuate and showing awareness of the need (strongest)
2. Age
3. Ability to pull clothes up/down
4. Completing tasks independently with pride
5. Saying "no" as sign of independence
6. Having a broader vocabulary

**Non-predictive signs (present in all children regardless of stage):**
- Sitting stable
- Picking up small objects
- Spontaneously placing objects in containers

### 3. ERIC Toilet Readiness Assessment
- **Citation:** ERIC (Education and Resources for Improving Childhood Continence), UK charity. Published 2022.
- **What it measures:** Child's overall readiness for toilet training including sensory factors.
- **Items:** Structured assessment covering developmental markers + sensory considerations. Exact item count not publicly available (PDF behind access wall).
- **Psychometrics:** Not formally validated in peer-reviewed research. Clinical tool designed for practitioner use.
- **Notable:** Unique in considering sensory factors (how sensations affect child's response to using the toilet). Acknowledges that negative answers don't necessarily prevent success — children may achieve continence via timed toileting even without traditional awareness signs.

### 4. Foxx-Azrin Readiness Prerequisites (1973)
- **Citation:** Azrin & Foxx (1971/1973). "A rapid method of toilet training the institutionalized retarded" + "Toilet Training in Less Than a Day."
- **What it measures:** Minimum prerequisites before beginning rapid training method.
- **Items:** 3 core prerequisites (bladder control, physical coordination, instruction following).
- **Psychometrics:** Not formally validated as a scale. Developed from behavioral research with institutionalized populations, later adapted for typically-developing children.
- **Notable:** First published method to describe objective criteria for readiness. Very narrow — assesses minimum physiological capacity only, not motivation or cognitive readiness.

**Foxx-Azrin Prerequisites:**
1. Bladder control (dry diaper for hours, eliminates all at once rather than in small amounts)
2. Can pull training pants up/down and walk between locations
3. Can follow instructions (sit in a chair, bring a toy when asked)

### 5. BABITT Questionnaire (2025)
- **Citation:** Leijon et al. (2025). "The BABITT questionnaire for evaluation of bowel and bladder function in children who are introduced to assisted infant toilet training — content validity and feasibility." *PLOS ONE*.
- **What it measures:** Parent-reported bladder and bowel FUNCTION (not readiness) in children introduced to assisted infant toilet training.
- **Items:** Multi-domain web-based questionnaire. I-CVI 0.88-1.00 across domains. 95% response rate in pilot.
- **Psychometrics:** Content validity established via expert panels. Feasibility confirmed.
- **Notable:** This measures outcomes/function rather than readiness. Included here because it's the most recently validated toilet-training-adjacent instrument and its domain structure is informative.

### 6. Brazelton Readiness Criteria (1962)
- **Citation:** Brazelton (1962). "A child-oriented approach to toilet training." *Pediatrics*, 29(1), 121-128.
- **What it measures:** Developmental readiness across physiological, cognitive, and social-emotional dimensions.
- **Items:** Not a formal scale — a clinical framework with 3 broad dimensions assessed via physician observation and parent interview. Studied across 1,170 children over 10 years.
- **Notable:** The foundational framework that AAP guidelines are built on. Still the most influential theoretical model. Not psychometrically validated as a questionnaire, but the domain structure has held up across 60+ years of subsequent research.

**Brazelton's Three Dimensions:**
1. Physiologic maturation (sphincter control, motor skills — sit, walk, dress/undress)
2. Internal feedback (self-esteem, motivation, desire to imitate, independence)
3. External feedback (understanding/responding to instructions, language)

## Domains/Factors Identified

Research converges on **three primary domains** with remarkable consistency across instruments and guidelines:

### 1. Physical/Physiological Readiness
- **What it covers:** Bladder control (dry for 2+ hours), bowel regularity, gross motor skills (walking, sitting on potty), fine motor skills (pulling pants up/down), sphincter maturation.
- **Sources:** All instruments, AAP, Mayo Clinic, Stanford, AAFP.
- **Key insight from Wyndaele-Kaerts:** Some physical skills (sitting stable, picking up objects) are developmentally present in ALL toddlers and have zero predictive value for toilet training success. The discriminating physical items are bladder control and clothing manipulation.

### 2. Cognitive/Language Readiness
- **What it covers:** Interoceptive awareness (recognizing need to go), receptive language (following 1-2 step instructions), expressive language (communicating about toileting), understanding potty-related words, imitation ability.
- **Sources:** TTRS, Wyndaele-Kaerts, Brazelton, AAP, AAFP.
- **Key insight:** The single strongest predictor across all research is the child expressing awareness of needing to evacuate. This is both cognitive (interoceptive awareness) and communicative.

### 3. Emotional/Motivational/Social Readiness
- **What it covers:** Discomfort with dirty diapers, interest in toilet/bathroom, desire to imitate adults, cooperative phase (not peak oppositional), desire for independence ("saying no"), pride in completing tasks, desire to please caregivers.
- **Sources:** TTRS, Brazelton, AAP, AAFP, Mayo Clinic.
- **Key insight:** Research distinguishes between negative motivation (discomfort with wet/dirty) and positive motivation (interest, curiosity, desire to imitate). Both matter but are separate constructs.

### Additional Factor: Parent/Caregiver Readiness (not in child-focused instruments)
- **What it covers:** Available time, emotional preparedness for accidents, consistency across caregivers, absence of major life stressors, realistic timeline expectations.
- **Sources:** AAP, AAFP, Canadian Paediatric Society, Brazelton framework.
- **Key insight:** Clinical guidelines consistently emphasize parent readiness alongside child readiness, but NO validated instrument measures this. The AAFP specifically recommends physicians assess: parent schedule, past experiences with training, negative memories of their own training, number of caregivers involved, and consistency across them.

### Additional Factor: Timing/Context (not in child-focused instruments)
- **What it covers:** Absence of major life transitions (new sibling, move, daycare start), family stability, consistent daily routine.
- **Sources:** AAP, Mayo Clinic, AAFP.
- **Key insight:** Every guideline warns against starting during stressful periods, but this is framed as clinical advice rather than measured in any instrument.

## Item Types & Response Formats

### Format: Binary Yes/No (TTRS)
- 10 items, each scored 1 (yes) or 0 (no)
- Total range: 0-10
- Cut-off score: 6
- **Pros:** Simple, fast, low cognitive load for parents
- **Cons:** No nuance (can't distinguish "sometimes" from "never"), low internal consistency (alpha 0.567)

### Format: Researcher Observation Checklist (Wyndaele-Kaerts)
- 18 developmental signs, present/absent via 8-hour direct observation
- Supplemented by parent questionnaire
- **Pros:** High predictive validity (0.97 AUC)
- **Cons:** Not practical for parent self-report; requires trained observer

### Format: Clinical Readiness Signs (AAP/Brazelton)
- Narrative list of signs organized by domain
- No formal scoring — physician uses clinical judgment
- **Pros:** Flexible, accounts for individual variation
- **Cons:** Not standardized, no cut-off scores, depends on clinician experience

### Format: Multiple-Choice with Graded Options (existing quiz)
- 3 options per question: full readiness (2-3 points), partial (1 point), not yet (0 points)
- Graded scoring allows nuance that binary yes/no misses
- **Pros:** Captures the "sometimes/emerging" middle ground that binary items lose
- **Cons:** Subjective interpretation of middle option

### Format: Online Commercial Quizzes (Pull-Ups, ProProfs, etc.)
- Typically yes/no or agree/disagree
- 5-10 questions
- Simple threshold: "mostly yes = ready"
- **Pros:** Fun, quick, shareable
- **Cons:** No validation, no domain-level feedback, no nuanced scoring

## Key Items We Can Adapt

### From the TTRS (validated, binary → adapt to graded):
- "My child has enough language skills to explain that he/she needs to go to the toilet" → maps to our Q7 (potty words)
- "My child can understand and follow up simple commands" → maps to our Q6 (2-step instructions)
- "My child can dress or undress on his/her own" → maps to our Q4 (pull pants)
- "My child feels uncomfortable after wetting/pooping" → maps to our Q8 (diaper discomfort)
- "My child has a tendency to and interested in using the toilet" → maps to our Q9 (bathroom interest)

### From Wyndaele-Kaerts (strongest predictors → adapt to parent-report):
- "Expressing need to evacuate and showing awareness of the need" → maps to our Q5 (awareness). This is the SINGLE STRONGEST predictor — our quiz correctly includes this.
- "Ability to pull clothes up/down" → maps to our Q4
- "Completing tasks independently with pride" → NOT in our current quiz. Could add.
- "Having a broader vocabulary" → partially captured by Q7 but could be more specific

### From AAP/AAFP Guidelines (clinical items → quiz format):
- "Asks to use potty-chair or wear 'big kid' underwear" → related to Q9 but more specific
- "Signals a need to use the bathroom (hopping, tugging pants)" → related to Q5 but focuses on nonverbal cues specifically
- "Regular, predictable bowel movements" → our Q2
- "Stays dry for 2+ hours" → our Q1
- "Uses words, facial expressions, or movements to signal elimination needs" → our Q5
- "Is uncomfortable in wet or dirty diapers" → our Q8
- "Interest in bathroom activities" → our Q9

### Items from Research NOT in Our Current Quiz:
- **Task completion pride / independence** (Wyndaele-Kaerts predictor) — child wants to do things by themselves and is proud when they succeed
- **Imitation behavior** (TTRS item 1, Brazelton) — child imitates others' actions, including bathroom behavior
- **Desire to wear "big kid" underwear** (AAP) — more specific motivational indicator than general "interest"
- **Parent readiness** (AAFP) — no validated child instrument includes this, but guidelines universally emphasize it

## Gaps

### What our quiz-ideas.md says vs what research supports:
- **quiz-ideas.md domains:** "Physical readiness, cognitive awareness, emotional/social readiness" → perfectly aligned with research consensus (Brazelton's three dimensions, TTRS structure, Wyndaele-Kaerts domains)
- **quiz-ideas.md format:** Type A assessment, each question in one domain, score ranges → well-supported by instrument design patterns
- **Our existing quiz (10 questions, 3 domains, 3-tier results):** Covers the core validated items well. The 3-option graded format is actually better than the TTRS binary format.

### What's missing from existing validated instruments that we'd want to add:
1. **Parent/caregiver readiness:** Every clinical guideline emphasizes this but no validated child-readiness instrument includes it. For our audience (parents taking a quiz about their child), adding 1-2 parent-readiness questions would be differentiated and clinically supported. Example: "Is now a calm period in your family? (no big moves, new siblings, daycare transitions)" — directly from AAP/AAFP guidance.
2. **Timing/context factors:** "Is your child in a cooperative phase?" (our Q10) is the closest to this, and it's a good item. Could add a stressor-check item.
3. **Independence/pride construct:** Wyndaele-Kaerts found "completing tasks independently with pride" is a significant predictor, but no quiz (including ours) directly asks about this.
4. **Sensory considerations:** ERIC uniquely includes sensory factors. For neurotypical children this is less critical, but acknowledging it would serve our audience well (many parents of spirited/sensory-sensitive kids).

### What existing instruments include that we probably should NOT:
- **TTRS item 8** ("My child gives a favourite object to a favourite person") — this is a general developmental milestone, not toilet-specific. Low face validity for a potty quiz.
- **TTRS item 4** ("My child can say 'no' as a sign of independence") — confusing for parents because saying "no" during potty training is often a PROBLEM, not a readiness sign. Research supports it as developmental milestone but the face validity in a parent quiz is poor.
- **Physical items with zero predictive value** (sitting stable, picking up small objects) — Wyndaele-Kaerts showed these don't discriminate. Including them would inflate scores without adding signal.

## Recommended Approach

### Domain Structure: Keep 3 domains, consider adding a 4th
Our current 3-domain structure (Physical, Cognitive, Emotional) is directly aligned with 60+ years of research from Brazelton through the 2024 TTRS. This is the correct structure.

**Consider adding:** A brief "Timing & Readiness Context" domain (1-2 items) covering parent readiness and stressor absence. This would differentiate our quiz from every validated instrument (none of which measure this) while being strongly supported by clinical guidelines. However, this changes the quiz from pure child-readiness to a "should you start now?" assessment — which may actually be MORE useful for parents.

### Item Format: Keep 3-option graded response
Our current format (Yes/regularly, Sometimes, Not yet) with 0/1/2-3 point scoring is superior to the TTRS binary format for several reasons:
- Captures the "emerging" middle state that parents actually observe
- Provides more scoring resolution without adding complexity
- The TTRS's low alpha (0.567) may partly result from forcing continuous behaviors into binary categories

### Item Selection: Our current 10 items are well-supported
Every item in our existing quiz maps to at least one validated instrument or clinical guideline. The coverage is strong. If revising:

**Strongest items (keep as-is):**
- Q1 (dry 2 hours) — in TTRS, Foxx-Azrin, AAP, Mayo Clinic
- Q5 (awareness when going) — strongest single predictor in Wyndaele-Kaerts
- Q8 (discomfort with dirty diapers) — in TTRS, AAP, Mayo Clinic
- Q6 (follow instructions) — in TTRS, Foxx-Azrin, Brazelton, AAP

**Items to consider adding in a revision:**
- Independence/pride in tasks (Wyndaele-Kaerts predictor, not currently measured)
- Imitation of others' bathroom behavior (TTRS item 1, Brazelton framework)
- Desire for "big kid" underwear or potty use (AAP — more specific than general interest)
- Family timing check (AAP/AAFP — "is now a good time?" stressor screen)

**Items to potentially refine:**
- Q10 (cooperative phase) — good item but somewhat vague. Could be more specific about what "cooperative" means in toileting context.

### Scoring: Current approach is sound
The 3-tier result system (Green Light / Yellow Light / Not Yet) maps naturally to clinical guidance. The domain-level breakdown gives parents actionable information about which specific readiness areas are strong vs still developing.

### Sources: Add TTRS and Wyndaele-Kaerts
Our current sources (AAP, Mayo Clinic, Stanford) are all clinical guidelines. Adding the TTRS (2024) and Wyndaele-Kaerts (2020) as research citations would strengthen the "research-backed" claim and provide peer-reviewed instrument support.
