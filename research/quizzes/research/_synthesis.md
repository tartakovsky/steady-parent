## Per-Quiz Summary

### 1. Bedtime Routine
- **Domains (6):** Routine consistency, routine activities, screen/stimulation management, sleep environment, bedtime cooperation, sleep onset independence
- **Response format:** 5-point frequency (Never/Rarely/Sometimes/Usually/Always, anchored to nights/week)
- **Items:** 12-15 (2-3 per domain)
- **Result structure:** Sum score per domain + total. Threshold-based bands: "strong routine" / "room to improve" / "worth addressing"
- **Special needs:** None. Straightforward Likert assessment. Strengths-based framing. Reverse-scored items for screen use.

### 2. Social Confidence
- **Domains (6):** Social approach style, peer comfort in groups, conflict response, empathy signals, friendship patterns, parent scaffolding role
- **Response format:** 4 response options per item, scenario-based. Each maps to a result archetype.
- **Items:** 5-7 (one per domain, roughly)
- **Result structure:** 4 PROFILE archetypes (Social Butterfly, Selective Connector, Quiet Observer, Solo Explorer) -- all positive/neutral
- **Special needs:** Age-gating question recommended (2-year-old playing alone is normal; 7-year-old consistently avoiding peers is different). Scenario-based items, not Likert.

### 3. Second Child Readiness
- **Domains (7):** Emotional bandwidth/stress, parenting competence, relationship quality/partner teamwork, practical/logistical readiness, social support, first child factors, motivation clarity
- **Response format:** 5-point Likert agreement for most; True/False for logistical items (CHAOS-style)
- **Items:** 20-25
- **Result structure:** Domain-level signals (green/yellow/red per domain) + overall readiness profile. NOT pass/fail. Weighted: emotional bandwidth and relationship quality carry more weight than logistics.
- **Special needs:** LONGEST quiz. Mixed response formats. No single validated instrument exists -- composite from 13 different instruments. Single-parent path needed (skip relationship domain). Most complex scoring: weighted, domain-level, narrative feedback.

### 4. Emotional Intelligence
- **Domains (5):** Emotion vocabulary/awareness, emotion recognition, emotion regulation, empathy/prosocial behavior, frustration tolerance/flexibility
- **Response format:** 5-point frequency (Almost never/Rarely/Sometimes/Often/Almost always)
- **Items:** ~20 (4 per domain)
- **Result structure:** Domain-level scores with age-contextualized interpretation
- **Special needs:** AGE BRANCHING required. Must include age-range selector (3-5, 6-8, 9-12) because scoring norms shift dramatically by age. A 3-year-old "sometimes" using feeling words is strong; a 10-year-old "sometimes" is a concern. 1-2 items may need age-specific wording.

### 5. Communication Safety
- **Domains (4):** Emotional welcome, openness climate, rupture repair, vulnerability comfort
- **Response format:** Mix of Likert frequency ("How often...") and scenario-based items. 5-point scale for Likert.
- **Items:** 10-14
- **Result structure:** Continuous score per domain mapped to 3-4 interpretive bands. Weight scenario items higher (less social desirability bias).
- **Special needs:** Scenario items are critical -- they bypass "I'm a great communicator" self-serving bias. Novel domain (rupture repair) has NO validated instrument support. Parent self-report about their own behavior, not child behavior.

### 6. Parenting Battery
- **Domains (5):** Energy (exhaustion), connection (emotional distancing), identity (contrast with former self), engagement (being fed up), recovery/recharge capacity
- **Response format:** 5-point frequency (Never/Rarely/Sometimes/Often/Almost always)
- **Items:** 10-12
- **Result structure:** Battery percentage (0-100%) mapped to 4 zones: Green (75-100% Charged), Yellow (50-74% Drawing Down), Orange (25-49% Running Low), Red (0-24% Critically Drained)
- **Special needs:** Full-spectrum measurement, not just the burnout end. Must include positive-pole items ("After putting kids to bed, I still have energy for myself"). Novel "recovery/recharge" dimension not in any validated instrument. Uses BR2 (Balance Between Risks and Resources) theoretical model.

### 7. Solid Foods Readiness
- **Domains (3+1):** Gross motor/postural readiness, oral-motor readiness, interest/feeding cues + age factor (guardrail)
- **Response format:** 3-option graded (Yes regularly / Sometimes / Not yet) with weighted point values
- **Items:** 8-10
- **Result structure:** 3-tier traffic light (Green Light/Yellow Light/Red Light)
- **Special needs:** AGE GUARDRAIL -- under 4 months = immediate "too early" result regardless of other scores. Drop "digestive readiness" (not parent-observable). Specific to babies 4-8 months. Premature baby adjusted-age note needed.

### 8. Age-Appropriate Chores
- **Domains (2+1):** Self-care tasks, household contribution tasks + parental scaffolding context
- **Response format:** 5-point independence gradient (Does it on own / Needs reminder / Needs some help / Needs a lot of help / Not doing this yet)
- **Items:** 8-12 dynamically selected based on age, plus 2-3 context items
- **Result structure:** Independence PROFILE (not a score or percentile). Growth recommendations: 2-3 specific next-step tasks from the next developmental tier.
- **Special needs:** DYNAMIC AGE-GATING required. Must input child's age, then quiz selects from a 30-40 item pool to show only age-appropriate tasks. Items span self-care AND household contribution. Include 2-3 "stretch" items from next age bracket. NEVER frame as "behind" or "ahead."

### 9. Drop the Nap
- **Domains (5):** Naptime behavior, nighttime sleep impact, daytime functioning without naps, pattern consistency, age/context
- **Response format:** 4-point frequency (Almost never / Sometimes / Often / Almost every day). Duration choices for timing items. Age dropdown.
- **Items:** 14-16
- **Result structure:** 3-tier (Not yet ready / In transition / Ready to drop). Domain 3 (daytime functioning) weighted most heavily.
- **Special needs:** "Too early" flag if child under ~2.5 years. "Concern" flag if excessive daytime sleepiness without napping (could indicate sleep disorder). Domain weighting in scoring. Mixed response types (frequency + duration choices + age dropdown).

### 10. Potty Training Readiness
- **Domains (3):** Physical/physiological, cognitive/language, emotional/motivational/social
- **Response format:** 3-option graded (Yes regularly / Sometimes / Not yet) with 0/1/2-3 point scoring
- **Items:** 10
- **Result structure:** 3-tier traffic light (Green/Yellow/Not Yet) + domain-level breakdown
- **Special needs:** Already built. Straightforward. Consider adding 1-2 parent readiness / timing items per clinical guidelines.

### 11. Kindergarten Readiness
- **Domains (5):** Social-emotional, self-regulation/approaches to learning, language/literacy, math/cognitive, physical/self-help
- **Response format:** 3-point ASQ-3 style (Yes consistently / Sometimes or emerging / Not yet)
- **Items:** 8-10
- **Result structure:** 3-tier (Ready to thrive / Almost there / Building foundations) + domain-level breakdown. Weight social-emotional and self-regulation higher than academic.
- **Special needs:** Domain weighting -- research shows social-emotional and self-regulation are strongest predictors of school success, more than academic skills. Age range: 4-6 years.

### 12. Screen Dependence
- **Domains (5):** Home media environment, why screens come out (parent-driven functional use), how screens are used (context/co-viewing), signs of dependence (problematic use markers), family screen norms
- **Response format:** 4-point minimum. Mix of frequency, categorical, and yes/no.
- **Items:** 12-15
- **Result structure:** Family media ecology profile, not child behavior score. Domain-level insights.
- **Special needs:** Must frame as FAMILY screen ecology, not child screen habits. Acknowledge parent-driven use without judgment. Must include parent self-assessment of own device dependence. Include "creep" / tolerance item. Content quality dimension needed.

### 13. Calm-Down Toolkit
- **Domains (3 sections):** Section A: Reactivity profile (how child reacts), Section B: Natural coping style (what child does when upset), Section C: Sensory/environmental preferences (what calms them)
- **Response format:** Behavioral vignettes with 4-point frequency scale. Concrete options per item.
- **Items:** 15-17
- **Result structure:** PERSONALIZED TOOLKIT -- a ranked set of 5-8 specific calming strategies matched to the child's profile. NOT a score or tier. Trigger-specific tips.
- **Special needs:** MOST COMPLEX OUTPUT. Cross-references reactivity profile x coping style x sensory preference to generate personalized recommendations. Strategy-matching engine, not just scoring. Must acknowledge co-regulation (some strategies need adult involvement). Kidcope-inspired dual-ask: both "does your child do X?" and "does it work?"

### 14. Sleepover Readiness
- **Domains (4+1):** Prerequisites (binary self-care + child interest), then scaled: separation comfort, nighttime comfort, communication/help-seeking, emotional regulation
- **Response format:** 4-point frequency (Never/Rarely/Sometimes/Often). Binary yes/no for prerequisites.
- **Items:** 12-16 scored + 3-4 prerequisite items
- **Result structure:** 4-tier graduated (Ready to try / Almost ready -- try a sleepunder / Build up gradually / Not yet). Include prior experience as context variable.
- **Special needs:** PREREQUISITE GATE -- basic self-care + child interest must pass before scored domains matter. Include positive/readiness items (not just absence of anxiety). Context-dependent results (sleepover at grandma's vs. new classmate's differ).

## Cross-Quiz Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quiz Architecture Types

Three distinct architectural patterns emerge:

**Type A: Domain-Scored Assessment** (most common)
Score per domain + total, mapped to interpretive tiers.
- Bedtime Routine, Emotional Intelligence, Communication Safety, Parenting Battery, Drop the Nap, Kindergarten Readiness, Screen Dependence

**Type B: Readiness Checklist**
Observable signs checked against developmental criteria, producing a "ready/not yet/getting close" signal.
- Potty Training, Solid Foods, Sleepover Readiness

**Type C: Profile-Based Matcher**
Input characteristics produce a matched output (archetype, toolkit, task list) rather than a score.
- Social Confidence (profiles), Calm-Down Toolkit (strategy matching), Age-Appropriate Chores (task recommendations)

**Outlier: Second Child Readiness** -- Composite multi-instrument assessment with weighted domain signals. Closest to Type A but with the most complex scoring and longest item count.

### Pattern 2: Response Formats

| Format | Quizzes Using It | When to Use |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **3-option graded** (Yes/Sometimes/Not yet) | Potty Training, Solid Foods, Kindergarten Readiness | Readiness checklists where behavior is present/emerging/absent |
| **4-point frequency** (Never/Sometimes/Often/Always) | Sleepover Readiness, Drop the Nap, Calm-Down Toolkit | Behavioral frequency without neutral midpoint |
| **5-point frequency** (Never-Always, anchored) | Bedtime Routine, Emotional Intelligence, Parenting Battery, Communication Safety | Domain-scored assessments needing granularity |
| **5-point independence gradient** | Age-Appropriate Chores | Tasks where assistance level is the key dimension |
| **Scenario-based** (4 options mapping to profiles) | Social Confidence, Communication Safety (mixed) | When reducing social desirability bias matters |
| **Mixed formats** | Second Child Readiness, Screen Dependence, Drop the Nap | Complex quizzes spanning different item types |

**Recommendation:** Standardize on 2-3 response format components:
1. **3-option readiness** for Type B quizzes
2. **5-point frequency** for Type A quizzes
3. **Scenario-based** for Type C quizzes and specific items in Type A

### Pattern 3: Result Structures

| Result Type | Quizzes | Architecture Need |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Traffic light tiers** (Green/Yellow/Red) | Potty Training, Solid Foods, Kindergarten Readiness, Drop the Nap | Simple threshold scoring, 2-3 cutpoints |
| **Graduated tiers** (4 levels) | Sleepover Readiness, Parenting Battery | More granular thresholds, 3 cutpoints |
| **Profile archetypes** (named types, all positive) | Social Confidence | Classification engine, not sum scoring |
| **Domain-level signals** | Second Child Readiness, Emotional Intelligence, Communication Safety, Bedtime Routine | Per-domain scoring + interpretation text per domain |
| **Personalized toolkit** | Calm-Down Toolkit | Cross-domain matching algorithm, output is recommendations not score |
| **Independence profile + recommendations** | Age-Appropriate Chores | Age-filtered scoring, output includes "next steps" task list |
| **Family ecology profile** | Screen Dependence | Multi-axis profile, no single score |

### Pattern 4: Age-Gating Requirements

| Requirement | Quizzes | Implementation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **No age-gating needed** | Parenting Battery, Communication Safety | Audience is parents; child age irrelevant |
| **Age as context** (adjusts interpretation, not items) | Emotional Intelligence, Social Confidence, Bedtime Routine | Age-range selector; same items, different norms/copy |
| **Age as guardrail** (blocks/redirects outside range) | Solid Foods (under 4mo = too early), Drop the Nap (under 2.5 = flag) | Hard gate: if age < X, show alternate result |
| **Age as filter** (selects different items) | Age-Appropriate Chores (30-40 item pool, 8-12 shown) | Dynamic item selection from pool based on age input |
| **Fixed narrow age range** (quiz only makes sense for X-Y) | Potty Training (~18mo-4yr), Kindergarten (~4-6yr), Solid Foods (~4-8mo) | Marketing/targeting, not architecture |

### Pattern 5: Who Is Being Assessed?

| Focus | Quizzes | Design Implication |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Child's behavior/readiness** (parent reports on child) | Potty Training, Solid Foods, Kindergarten, Emotional Intelligence, Social Confidence, Sleepover, Drop the Nap | Items: "Does your child..." or "Can your child..." |
| **Parent's own behavior/state** | Parenting Battery, Communication Safety, Screen Dependence | Items: "I feel..." or "When my child is upset, I..." |
| **Family system** | Second Child Readiness, Screen Dependence | Items about relationship, household, environment, norms |
| **Child's profile for matching** | Calm-Down Toolkit, Age-Appropriate Chores | Items: "When your child is upset, they typically..." |

### Pattern 6: Quizzes That Can Share Architecture

**Group 1: Simple Readiness Checklists (share same engine)**
- Potty Training, Solid Foods, Kindergarten Readiness
- Same architecture: 3-option items, domain-tagged, sum-scored, traffic-light tiers
- Differ only in: items, domain definitions, tier thresholds, result copy

**Group 2: Domain-Scored Likert Assessments (share same engine)**
- Bedtime Routine, Emotional Intelligence, Parenting Battery, Drop the Nap
- Same architecture: 5-point Likert, domain-tagged, sum per domain + total, tier mapping
- Differ in: items, domains, scoring weights, result copy
- Communication Safety fits here but with mixed item types (Likert + scenario)

**Group 3: Unique Architectures (each needs something custom)**
- **Social Confidence**: Profile classification (not scoring) -- maps responses to archetypes
- **Calm-Down Toolkit**: Cross-domain matching engine -- input = profile, output = strategy recommendations
- **Age-Appropriate Chores**: Dynamic item selection from large pool + independence gradient + task recommendation output
- **Screen Dependence**: Multi-axis ecology profile with mixed response formats
- **Second Child Readiness**: Weighted composite with domain-level signals, longest quiz, mixed formats, conditional paths (single parent skip)
- **Sleepover Readiness**: Prerequisite gate (binary must-pass) + domain-scored assessment = hybrid

### Pattern 7: Domains That Recur Across Quizzes

| Recurring Domain | Appears In |
|-----------------|------------|
| **Emotion regulation** | Emotional Intelligence, Calm-Down Toolkit, Sleepover Readiness, Kindergarten Readiness |
| **Self-care independence** | Age-Appropriate Chores, Sleepover Readiness, Kindergarten Readiness, Potty Training |
| **Separation comfort** | Sleepover Readiness, Social Confidence (partially), Kindergarten Readiness |
| **Sleep environment/routine** | Bedtime Routine, Drop the Nap |
| **Parent stress/burnout** | Parenting Battery, Second Child Readiness |
| **Relationship quality** | Second Child Readiness (only) |
| **Social skills/peer comfort** | Social Confidence, Kindergarten Readiness |
| **Empathy/prosocial** | Emotional Intelligence, Social Confidence |
| **Screen behavior** | Screen Dependence, Bedtime Routine (screen management domain) |

This suggests potential for **cross-quiz linking** -- if a user scores low on emotion regulation in the Kindergarten Readiness quiz, point them to the Calm-Down Toolkit quiz.

## Architecture Recommendations

### 1. Build Two Scoring Engines, Not Fourteen

**Engine A: Sum-Scored Assessment**
- Handles: Potty Training, Solid Foods, Kindergarten Readiness, Bedtime Routine, Emotional Intelligence, Parenting Battery, Drop the Nap, Communication Safety, Sleepover Readiness, Screen Dependence
- Features needed:
  - Items tagged to domains
  - Per-item point values (may differ per response option)
  - Reverse-scoring flag
  - Domain sum + total sum
  - Configurable tier thresholds (per quiz, per domain)
  - Age input as context variable (adjusts interpretation text, not scoring)
  - Optional: item weighting by domain
  - Optional: prerequisite gate (Sleepover) -- binary items that must pass before scored items matter

**Engine B: Profile Matcher**
- Handles: Social Confidence, Calm-Down Toolkit, Age-Appropriate Chores
- Features needed:
  - Response options map to profile dimensions (not point values)
  - Classification logic (which profile best matches the response pattern)
  - Dynamic item selection from pool (Chores: age-filtered)
  - Output is a matched profile/toolkit/task list, not a score

**Second Child Readiness** can use Engine A with extensions: domain weighting, conditional item display (skip relationship for single parents), and the most complex result page (per-domain narrative).

### 2. Standardize the Data Model

Every quiz shares:
```
Quiz
  - id, title, slug, description
  - targetAgeRange (optional min/max months)
  - inputFields: [{ type: age | singleSelect, id, label }]
  - items: [{ id, text, subtext, domain, responseOptions, source }]
  - domains: [{ id, label, weight, description }]
  - resultConfig: { type: tiers | profiles | toolkit, ... }
```

Every item shares:
```
Item
  - id, text, subtext (explanatory text below question)
  - domain (tag)
  - responseOptions: [{ label, value, points }]
  - reverseScored: boolean
  - source (citation reference)
  - ageFilter (optional: only show for age range X-Y)
```

### 3. Response Format Components

Build these as reusable components:
1. **LikertFrequency5** -- Never / Rarely / Sometimes / Often / Almost always (0-4 points)
2. **ReadinessGraded3** -- Yes, consistently / Sometimes or emerging / Not yet (3/1/0 or 2/1/0)
3. **Frequency4** -- Almost never / Sometimes / Often / Almost every day (0-3 points)
4. **IndependenceGradient5** -- On their own / With reminder / Some help / Lots of help / Not yet (4-0 points)
5. **ScenarioPicker** -- 3-4 scenario descriptions, each mapping to a profile dimension
6. **AgeInput** -- Dropdown or slider for child age
7. **BinaryGate** -- Yes / No (prerequisite pass/fail)

### 4. Result Page Components

Build these as reusable components:
1. **TrafficLightResult** -- Green/Yellow/Red hero with headline + domain breakdown
2. **GraduatedTierResult** -- 4 tiers with progress indicator
3. **BatteryGauge** -- Percentage display with 4 color zones (Parenting Battery only, but visually distinctive)
4. **ProfileCard** -- Named archetype with illustration + description (Social Confidence)
5. **ToolkitResult** -- Ranked list of strategies with explanations (Calm-Down Toolkit)
6. **DomainBreakdown** -- Per-domain score bars with interpretation text (shared by many)
7. **NextStepsList** -- Actionable recommendations (Chores, and also appended to most results)

### 5. Prioritize Implementation by Shared Architecture

**Phase 1: Engine A + TrafficLightResult** (covers the most quizzes with least custom work)
- Potty Training (already built -- use as reference implementation)
- Solid Foods Readiness
- Kindergarten Readiness

**Phase 2: Engine A + DomainBreakdown** (add domain-level scoring)
- Bedtime Routine
- Parenting Battery (+ BatteryGauge result component)
- Drop the Nap

**Phase 3: Engine B + ProfileCard/ToolkitResult** (custom matching logic)
- Social Confidence
- Calm-Down Toolkit

**Phase 4: Complex / Hybrid**
- Emotional Intelligence (Engine A + age branching)
- Communication Safety (Engine A + scenario items)
- Screen Dependence (Engine A + mixed formats + ecology profile)
- Age-Appropriate Chores (Engine B + dynamic item pool)
- Sleepover Readiness (Engine A + prerequisite gate)
- Second Child Readiness (Engine A + full complexity)

## Special Architecture Needs Summary

| Quiz | Unique Requirement |
|------|--------------------|
| Second Child Readiness | Conditional paths (single parent skip), longest quiz (20-25 items), weighted domain scoring, mixed response formats |
| Age-Appropriate Chores | Dynamic item selection from 30-40 item pool based on age input |
| Calm-Down Toolkit | Cross-domain matching to generate personalized strategy list (not a score) |
| Social Confidence | Profile classification rather than scoring |
| Emotional Intelligence | Age-branched scoring norms (same items, different interpretation by age band) |
| Solid Foods | Hard age guardrail (under 4 months = immediate alternate result) |
| Drop the Nap | Domain weighting (daytime functioning counts more than other domains) |
| Sleepover Readiness | Prerequisite gate (binary must-pass items before scored assessment) |
| Screen Dependence | Assesses family system not just child; parent self-assessment items |
| Communication Safety | Scenario items mixed with Likert; assesses parent's own behavior |
| Parenting Battery | Battery metaphor result display; positive-pole items (measures full spectrum, not just burnout) |
| Bedtime Routine | Straightforward -- no special needs beyond standard Engine A |
| Potty Training | Already built -- straightforward readiness checklist |
| Kindergarten Readiness | Domain weighting (social-emotional > academic) |

## Key Takeaways for Architecture

1. **Two engines handle everything.** A sum-scored assessment engine (Engine A) covers 10-11 quizzes. A profile-matching engine (Engine B) covers 3. The complexity is in the result pages, not the scoring.

2. **The result page is where quizzes diverge most.** Scoring is relatively simple and standardizable. The result experience -- traffic lights vs. battery gauges vs. personalized toolkits -- is where each quiz needs its own design.

3. **Age-gating is the most cross-cutting concern.** Five quizzes need it in some form. Build it as a first-class feature: age input that can filter items, adjust norms, gate results, or just contextualize copy.

4. **Domain-level feedback is the default.** Only 3 quizzes (Potty Training, Solid Foods, Social Confidence) produce a single result without domain breakdown. Everything else shows per-domain insights. Make domain breakdown a standard result component.

5. **Scenario items need their own component.** Social Confidence and Communication Safety depend on scenario-based questions (not Likert). Calm-Down Toolkit uses behavioral vignettes. Build a scenario/vignette question type alongside the standard Likert.

6. **Cross-quiz linking is a content win.** Emotion regulation, self-care independence, and separation comfort appear in 3-4 quizzes each. When a user finishes one quiz with a low score in a shared domain, link them to the quiz that goes deeper on that domain.

7. **No quiz claims clinical validity.** Every research brief emphasizes this is entertainment/educational, not diagnostic. Build a standard disclaimer component used across all quizzes.
