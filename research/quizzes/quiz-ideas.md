# Quiz Ideas for Steady Parent

All quizzes generated by AI. We develop schema templates + generation prompts, then batch-produce everything.

**Design principles across ALL quizzes:**
- Results are always positive or validating — no one shares "you're a bad parent"
- Confirmation bias is the engine — "wow, this is so me" triggers sharing
- Identity > score — people share WHO they are, not a number
- Scenario questions > opinion questions — "Your kid does X, you do..." not "Do you believe..."
- 6-10 questions max — fun journey, not an exam
