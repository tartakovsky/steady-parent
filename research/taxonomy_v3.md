## Major Cross-Link Pathways

1. **The Behavior Chain**: Tantrums -> Aggression -> Discipline -> Staying Calm -> Breaking the Cycle -> Repair -> Connection
   - A parent searching for tantrum help naturally flows into discipline philosophy, then into "how do I stay calm," then into deeper self-work about why they react the way they do.

2. **The Anxiety Web**: Anxiety -> Sleep (bedtime fears) -> Social Skills (social anxiety) -> Separation -> School refusal
   - Anxious kids show up in many contexts; each category handles the context-specific angle while Anxiety holds the core strategies.

3. **The New Baby Highway**: New Parent -> Siblings -> Sleep Regression -> Tantrums (jealousy) -> Staying Calm (overwhelm)
   - A parent with a new baby will touch at least 4-5 categories within weeks.

4. **The Age Escalation Path**: New Parent -> Toddler behaviors (Tantrums, Aggression, Potty) -> School-age (Social Skills, Big Feelings) -> Teens
   - Parents re-enter the content ecosystem at each developmental stage.

5. **The Philosophy Spine**: Parenting Science -> Parenting Philosophy -> Discipline -> Big Feelings -> Every specific behavior category
   - Parents who start with "what kind of parent do I want to be?" flow into practical application.

6. **The Parent Healing Path**: Staying Calm (tactics) -> Breaking the Cycle (deep work) -> Parenting Philosophy (identity) -> Parenting Science (evidence)
   - The parent-focused journey from "I need to stop yelling today" to "I understand why I am this way and I'm choosing something different."

# Coverage Gaps

Topics parents commonly search for that have **thin or no coverage** in the 965 source titles:

1. **ADHD and neurodivergent-specific strategies** -- Several titles mention "differently wired kids," ODD, OCD, sensory issues, and Tourette's, but there is no systematic coverage. These are extremely high-search-volume topics. The Spirited Kids category can serve as a landing zone, but dedicated ADHD content would need to be created from scratch.

2. **Co-parenting logistics** -- Divorce appears in roughly 10 titles, but specific co-parenting mechanics (communication tools, parallel parenting, scheduling apps) are thin. High-demand topic that would strengthen the Transitions category.

3. **Dad-specific content** -- Only 3-4 titles address fatherhood directly ("Dad adjusting to new baby," "Happy fathers day," "Will kids be OK without a dad?"). Search volume for dad-focused parenting content is significant and growing.

4. **Multilingual and multicultural parenting** -- Zero coverage. Growing search demand.

5. **Child's academic struggles** -- Homework battles appear a few times, but learning disabilities, reading struggles, math anxiety, and gifted education are largely absent. These could be standalone articles in Discipline or Teens.

6. **Toddler speech and language delays** -- One title about "not talking yet," but speech delay is a top parent concern with high search volume. Does not clearly fit any existing category.

7. **Gender identity and LGBTQ+ family topics** -- One title about nonbinary kids, one about clothing preferences. Very thin for a topic with growing search interest. Would fit in Body Safety or Parenting Philosophy.

8. **Single parent-specific strategies** -- Mentioned in passing but no dedicated coverage. Different challenges (no co-regulator, financial stress) that could be woven into Staying Calm and Discipline articles.

9. **Picky eating deep dives** -- Only 5-6 food-related titles. This is one of the most-searched parenting topics and could support a fuller series with more source material. The Eating category is the thinnest.

10. **Regression behaviors as a unified topic** -- Sleep regression is covered, but general regression (potty regression, behavior regression after life changes) could be addressed more systematically across categories.
