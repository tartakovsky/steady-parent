    "The 5-minute claim is a key differentiator for time-constrained parents; homepage emphasizes access over depth",
    "Homepage keywords are mostly branded terms (good inside, dr becky) - long-tail behavioral keywords are captured by internal pages, suggesting intentional content distribution strategy",
    "Sturdy parenting philosophy provides unique vocabulary that differentiates from generic parenting advice market",
    "App features are positioned as personalized support + chatbot + reminders, keeping functionality minimal above the fold"
