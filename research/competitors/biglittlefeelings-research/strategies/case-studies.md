# Strategy: Case Studies & Expert Content

## What It Is

Case studies and social proof content that builds trust through real parent stories, expert interviews, testimonials, and authority-building profiles. This strategy ranges from first-person narratives to podcast interviews with recognized experts, creating credibility through multiple trust signals.

## Why It Works

Parents making decisions about parenting approaches need to see that methods work for real families. Case studies serve multiple SEO and conversion purposes:

- **Trust building** - Real stories from relatable parents reduce risk perception
- **Long-tail traffic** - Specific scenarios ("my toddler won't stop hitting") capture problem-aware searches
- **Expert authority** - Interviews and profiles establish thought leadership
- **Social proof** - Reviews and testimonials create FOMO and credibility
- **Content depth** - Personal narratives create engaging, shareable content that earns natural backlinks

The emotional resonance of authentic stories converts visitors into customers better than purely educational content.
