## Key Insights

### What Works

1. **Content Depth:** 2,000-4,500 word comprehensive guides outperform shallow content
2. **Founder Authority:** Personal brand (credentials, media presence) drives differentiation
3. **Problem-First Language:** Match exact parent searches ("how to stop toddler hitting")
4. **Age Segmentation:** Parents search by child age more than general topics
5. **Trust Signals:** Guarantees, social proof, credentials above the fold
6. **Multiple CTAs:** Different conversion paths for different readiness levels

### Market Gaps (Opportunities)

1. **Parent Emotional Wellness:** Most focus on child behavior, not parent overwhelm/rage
2. **Therapy-Informed Depth:** Few integrate clinical frameworks (CBT, IFS, attachment) deeply
3. **Video SEO:** Heavily text-focused, video demonstrations underutilized
4. **Interactive Tools:** Beyond quizzes, calculators/assessments are rare
5. **Cultural/DEI Content:** Limited diverse family structure representation

### Differentiation Angles

- **Therapy Room to Living Room:** Clinical psychology techniques made practical
- **Parent-Child Dyad:** Focus on relationship system, not just child behavior
- **Evidence + Accessible:** Research-backed but warm, relatable tone
- **Video + Written Hybrid:** Demonstrate techniques visually
- **Community-Driven:** Real parent questions inform content priorities
