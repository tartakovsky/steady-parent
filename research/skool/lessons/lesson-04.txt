LESSON 4: Regulate, Relate, Reason (Adjusted for Real Life)

You've probably heard of Bruce Perry's "Regulate, Relate, Reason" sequence. It's become a cornerstone of trauma-informed parenting, and for good reason—it works. The brain processes experience in a specific order, and trying to reason with a dysregulated child is like trying to have a conversation with someone who's drowning.

But here's the problem: the way it's often taught makes it sound like every conflict requires a 20-minute therapeutic intervention. And that's not realistic when you have dinner to make, other kids to manage, and a job that starts in 45 minutes.

Let's break down what this sequence actually means and how to use it efficiently.

The Sequence Explained:

1. Regulate: Help them (and yourself) move out of fight/flight/freeze. This is about the body, not the mind. Lower your voice. Slow down. Get on their level. Remove stimulation if needed. Sometimes just your calm presence is enough.

2. Relate: Connect before you correct. This doesn't mean a long conversation—it can be a single sentence that shows you understand what they're experiencing. "You're frustrated." "You didn't want to stop." This tells their brain: I'm safe. This person gets me.

3. Reason: Only after regulation and connection can you actually teach, problem-solve, or discuss consequences. This is when the prefrontal cortex comes back online.

The Mistake: Skipping to Reason

Most parents default to reason first. "Why did you do that?" "You know better." "How many times have I told you?"

When a child is dysregulated, these questions don't compute. They can't access the part of their brain that knows better. You're essentially asking their brainstem to do algebra.

The Other Mistake: Turning It Into a Therapy Session

Some parents swing the other way. They spend so long on regulate and relate that the child never gets to reason. Every meltdown becomes a 30-minute processing session. The child learns that big emotions get big attention, and the actual issue never gets addressed.

The balance: be warm, be brief, be clear.

Real-Life Application:

Scenario: Your child hits their sibling because they took their toy.

What NOT to do:
"Why did you hit? You know hitting is wrong. How would you feel if someone hit you? We don't hit in this family."

What to do:

1. Regulate: Calmly separate them. "I'm going to help you calm down." (No lecture yet.)

2. Relate: "You were so mad when she took that." (One sentence. That's it.)

3. Reason: Once calm—maybe in a few minutes, maybe after snack—circle back. "Hitting hurts. Next time you're that mad, what could you do instead?"

Total time: maybe 5 minutes of actual engagement, spread out.

Scripts for Each Stage:

Regulate:
- "Let's take some breaths together."
- "I'm going to sit here with you."
- "We're going to pause for a minute."

Relate:
- "That was really hard for you."
- "You didn't want that to happen."
- "I get it."

Reason:
- "What could we try next time?"
- "Here's the rule: we don't hit."
- "You can be mad. You can't hurt people."

What to Watch For:

- If you're still dysregulated, you can't help them regulate. Take your own breath first.
- Relating doesn't mean agreeing. "I understand you're angry" is not the same as "You're right."
- Reasoning too soon is the most common error. If they're still activated, pause and go back to regulate.

The Quick Version for Busy Moments:

Sometimes you don't have time for a full sequence. That's okay. You can do a compressed version:

1. Regulate: Lower your voice, get close.
2. Relate: One sentence of acknowledgment.
3. Reason: State the boundary and move on.

"I see you're upset (relate). Take a breath (regulate). Hitting is not okay. Let's figure this out when you're calm (reason)."

This can happen in 30 seconds. It's not ideal for every situation, but it's better than skipping straight to punishment or letting the behavior slide.

Key Takeaway:

Regulate, relate, reason is a sequence, not a ritual. You don't need to turn every conflict into a therapy session. You need to meet your child where they are, connect briefly, and then address the issue. Warmth and efficiency can coexist.

You can stay in charge while staying calm enough to be effective. That's the goal.

Next lesson: boundaries that actually stick.
