# Affiliate Monetization Strategy

## Option 1: Auto-Monetization (Easiest)

**Platforms:**
- https://www.skimlinks.com
- https://www.sovrn.com/publishers/commerce/ (formerly VigLink)

**How it works:**
- Install one script on your site
- All outbound links automatically become affiliate links
- 48,500+ merchants (Skimlinks) / 70,000+ (Sovrn)
- No individual applications needed

**Downside:** They take ~25% of commissions

This is the "set and forget" approach. You write naturally and link to products without thinking about affiliate mechanics.

## Option 2: Join Major Networks (One Application = Thousands of Brands)

Apply once to each network, then apply to individual programs within (usually instant/auto-approval).

| Network | Brands | Strength |
|---------|--------|----------|
| https://www.shareasale.com | 3,900+ merchants | Many baby/parenting brands (Ergobaby, Newton Baby, DockATot) |
| https://www.cj.com | Enterprise brands | BabyBjörn (20%), Ten Little (10%) |
| https://impact.com | Premium brands | Walmart, major DTC brands |
| https://www.awin.com | 20,000+ advertisers | Strong in Europe, owns ShareASale |
| https://rakutenadvertising.com | 1,000 exclusive brands | Gerber, H&M |

**Workflow:**
1. Create one account per network
2. Browse their merchant directories filtered by "parenting/baby/kids"
3. Bulk-apply to programs (most approve within 24-48 hours)
4. Get all your links from one dashboard

## Option 3: High-Commission Parenting Programs

Direct programs worth the manual signup:

| Program | Commission | Cookie |
|---------|------------|--------|
| BabyBjörn | 20% | 120 days |
| Organic Baby Foods 24 | 25% | - |
| KeaBabies | 15-20% | - |
| Ultimate Bundles | 40% | - |
| Parenting Simply | 40% | 365 days |
| DockATot | 10% | - |
| GroVia | 10% + repeat | - |

## Recommended Stack for Parenting Sites

Start with this combination:

1. **Skimlinks** - catches everything automatically (passive income layer)
2. **ShareASale** - most baby/parenting brands live here
3. **Impact** - for bigger DTC brands and Walmart
4. **Cherry-pick 5-10 direct programs** with 15%+ commissions for products you recommend most

This approach provides broad coverage without manual outreach while optimizing for higher commissions on best-sellers.
