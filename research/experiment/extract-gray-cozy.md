# Extracted Content: The Cozy Corner - Relevant to "How to Handle a Tantrum That's Already Happening"

## Short-Term Benefits (In the Moment)

The Cozy Corner serves an immediate function: helping toddlers **soothe and settle big feelings in the heat of the moment**. The space provides containment during emotional overwhelm. A secondary short-term benefit is **building resilience** through the practice of moving through difficult emotions rather than suppressing them.

## Critical Implementation Guidelines: During an Active Tantrum

### Essential: Stay With Them (Co-Regulation Model)

The parent's role is to **stay with the child**. This is described as **regulating with them** and **staying present through their big feelings**. The word "with" is emphasized, indicating the relational and collaborative nature of the process. The parent is not a passive observer but an active co-regulator whose calm presence helps the child's nervous system settle.

### Exception: When the Child Requests Space

If the child asks for space to be by themselves, this is acceptable. The recommended response: tell them **"I'll be right over here if you need me or want a hug."** This preserves the sense of availability and safety while honoring the child's autonomy and developing self-awareness about their needs.

### Anti-Pattern: Never "Send" a Child to the Cozy Corner

The framing explicitly warns: **We are never "sending them" to their cozy corner.** This distinguishes the Cozy Corner from punishment-based approaches like traditional time outs. The Cozy Corner is a resource the child can access, accompanied by a supportive parent. It is not a place of isolation or consequence. Sending implies rejection; accompanying implies connection.

## Physical Elements to Help Soothe an Active Tantrum

### Squishable Object (Stress Ball or Similar)

Add something the child can physically squish, such as a stress ball. This element is described as **especially helpful for anger and fear**. The underlying principle: **emotions are connected to our bodies**. Physical action provides a release valve for the physiological arousal that accompanies strong emotions. Squishing engages the body in a safe, non-destructive way.

### Drawing Materials

Include materials for drawing. The purpose: **letting big feelings out without relying on words**. This acknowledges that toddlers (and many older children and adults) cannot always verbalize their emotional experience. Drawing provides an alternative release channel that bypasses the verbal processing system.

### Feelings Chart (Visual Aid for Emotional Identification)

A printed feelings chart should be kept in the Cozy Corner. Its function is to **help the child identify how they are feeling**. This addresses a core challenge for toddlers: they experience emotions intensely but lack the vocabulary or self-awareness to name what is happening internally. The visual aid bridges this gap.

### Huggable Object (Lovey or Stuffy)

Include something specifically designated for hugging during distress. This is not merely decorative. Parents should **explicitly explain** to the child that when they feel sad or mad, they can hug this object to feel better. The explanation creates an intentional association between the object and emotional relief.

## Underlying Philosophy: Time In vs. Time Out

The Cozy Corner represents a **"Time In"** paradigm. Where time outs involve isolation and often carry punitive connotations, Time Ins involve:

- **Presence** over isolation
- **Support** over punishment
- **Teaching** over consequences
- **Connection** over disconnection
- **Co-regulation** leading to eventual self-regulation

The approach treats tantrums and big feelings as opportunities for learning rather than behaviors to be extinguished through negative consequences.
