## The Four Expert Tips

### Tip 1: Approach With Curiosity

**Core principle:** The tantrum is not about you. Often it is not even about the apparent trigger.

**Self-questioning protocol during tantrums:**
- "What's going on for my child right now?"
- "When was the last time they ate and slept?"
- "Have they had a busy day?"
- "Do they need a break?"
- "What are they trying to tell me?"

**Mindset shift:** Transform from "this is being done to me" to "this is an opportunity to learn from my child."

### Tip 2: Practice the Art of "Being With"

**What "being with" means:**
- Stay physically near your toddler
- Minimize verbal input (see Tip 3)
- Add no new demands
- Communicate through presence that the child is seen
- Signal that you will be there to discuss what happened after the emotional storm passes

**Critical warning about mid-tantrum demands:** Whatever demands the child places on you, or words they say during the tantrum, should not be acted upon in the moment.

**Example of contradictory tantrum demands:** "Mommy I need the bear... No Mommy no bear... Mommy I need milk... Mommy no milk"

**Correct response to contradictory demands:** Acknowledge that you can discuss their requests once they are calm. Then simply wait with them as they process.

**Why "being with" works:** Offering your calm and demonstrating confidence in handling their big feelings is powerful. Children learn to regulate their own dysregulation through repeated exposure to parental calm over time. This is a co-regulation to self-regulation developmental pathway.

### Tip 3: The Louder They Talk, the Softer You Talk

**Counter-intuitive principle:** When your child escalates volume, decrease your volume.

**Why yelling backfires:**
- Child matches your tone
- Child feels compelled to yell louder to be heard
- Escalation spiral results

**Why speaking softly works:**
- Child must tune in to hear what you are saying
- Child must quiet their voice to hear yours
- De-escalation becomes possible

**Additional linguistic principle:** Children in emotional flooding cannot process complex language. During strong emotional moments, keep language minimal with short, clear directions.

**Timing of explanation:** Wait until the child has borrowed your calm and returned to a state where they can understand words before engaging in discussion.

### Tip 4: Teach Words and Skills After Calm Returns

**Key insight:** Emotional regulation and verbalizing emotions are skills that must be taught, equivalent to brushing teeth or using a fork. These are learned competencies, not innate abilities.

**Post-tantrum teaching protocol:**

**Step 1: Narration and labeling**
Help the child verbalize what happened by narrating the experience calmly and empathetically. Tell them the story of what happened before, during, and after the tantrum. This helps them make sense of their own emotions and experiences.

**Example labeling statements:**
- "It's tough for you when Daddy has to leave for work. You feel sad that you can't go with."
- "You are feeling sad right now; it's hard to share your toys."
- "You feel really mad with Tommy when he takes your toys, and it is tough. How can we tell Tommy how you feel?"

**Step 2: Skill practice**
After narration, practice skills that allow the child to express needs without a tantrum:
- Asking for a break
- Taking space
- Deep breathing
- Other age-appropriate coping strategies

## The Parent's Role: Defined

**Your job is NOT to join your child's chaos.**

**Your job IS to remain your child's calm in the chaos.**

---

## Why Traditional Discipline Methods Fail

**Traditional punishment methods do not work** because they assume the child possesses self-regulation skills they have not yet developed. Failed approaches include:
- Timeouts
- Spanking
- Yelling the child out of a tantrum

**Root cause of failure:** These methods expect the child to calm themselves using skills they do not possess. The child literally cannot comply even if they wanted to.

## Tantrums as Physiological Events

**Tantrums are a physiological reaction that helps toddlers restore equilibrium in their bodies.** This is not a conscious choice or manipulation strategy.

**What tantrums are NOT:**
- Attempts to manipulate parents
- Efforts to control parents
- Intentional behavior to make parents angry
- Evidence of bad parenting
- Signs of a defective or "bad" child
- Indicators that parents are missing critical knowledge

## Summary of What Works vs. What Fails

**Effective approaches:**
- Staying curious about underlying causes
- Physical presence without excessive verbal input
- Speaking softly when child speaks loudly
- Waiting until calm to discuss and teach
- Narrating experiences to build emotional vocabulary
- Practicing alternative coping skills
- Offering consistent parental calm as a regulatory anchor
- Viewing tantrums as attachment-building opportunities

**Ineffective approaches:**
- Timeouts
- Spanking
- Yelling
- Adding demands during the tantrum
- Following contradictory mid-tantrum requests
- Using complex language during emotional flooding
- Taking the tantrum personally
- Expecting self-regulation skills the child does not yet have
