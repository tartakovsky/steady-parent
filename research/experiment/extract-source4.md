# How to Handle a Tantrum That's Already Happening (Extracted from Source 4)

## Five Practical Strategies for Navigating Tantrums

### Strategy 1: Approach Tantrums with Curiosity

**Mindset shift:** The tantrum is not about you. It often is not even about the thing triggering it.

**Self-inquiry questions during a tantrum:**
- What's going on for my child right now?
- When is the last time they ate?
- When is the last time they slept?
- Have they had a busy day?
- Do they need a break?
- What are they trying to tell me?

**Outcome:** These questions reframe the tantrum from something being done TO you into an opportunity to learn FROM your child.

### Strategy 2: Practice the Art of "Being With"

**What to do:**
- Stay physically near your toddler
- Do not add extra language
- Do not add new demands
- Simply be present
- Communicate nonverbally that they are seen and you are there

**What to communicate:** When they finish working through the behavior, you will be there to talk about what happened.

**Critical warning about demands during tantrums:** The contradictory requests a toddler makes mid-tantrum ("I need the bear... no bear... I need milk... no milk") should NOT be acted upon in the moment. These are part of the tantrum itself, not genuine requests requiring response.

**Proper response to mid-tantrum demands:** Tell the child that once they are calm, you can discuss their requests. Then simply wait with them as they work through the feelings.

### Strategy 3: The Louder They Talk, the Softer You Talk

**The matching problem:** When you yell at a tantruming child, they match your tone and feel compelled to yell louder to be heard.

**The quiet voice technique:**
- Speak in a quiet voice instead of yelling
- This prompts the child to tune into what you are saying
- The child must quiet their own voice to hear yours

**Language comprehension limitation:** Just as children lack verbal emotion regulation skills, they also lack the ability to process what you are saying during moments of strong emotion.

**Language guidelines during tantrums:**
- Keep language at a minimum
- Use short directions
- Use clear directions

### Strategy 5: Distract, Keep Things Light, and Move Forward

**Balance required:** Empathize and offer understanding while avoiding being triggered or drawn into their big emotions.

**Practical techniques:**
- Do something silly
- Distract with another object
- Distract with a different conversation
- Change location (especially effective if tantrum is location or object specific)

**What staying calm demonstrates to the child:**
- You can handle their emotions
- Their emotions are not scary to you
- Alternative ways of dealing with big feelings exist

**Practical benefit:** This approach keeps tantrums more manageable for the parent.

## Guiding Philosophy

**Quote (L.R. Knost):** "Every day in a hundred ways our children ask, 'Do you see me? Do you hear me? Do I matter?' Their behaviour often reflects our response."

**Role definition:** "Our job isn't to join our child's chaos, but to remain our child's calm in the chaos."

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Alternative |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Timeouts | Assumes self-regulation skills that do not exist | Stay present, "be with" |
| Spanking | Punishes lack of skill rather than teaching | Teach skills after calm |
| Yelling | Escalates volume matching | Speak quieter as they get louder |
| Acting on mid-tantrum demands | Demands are part of tantrum, not real requests | Wait until calm to discuss requests |
| Adding language during tantrum | Child cannot process complex language during emotional flooding | Use minimal, short, clear directions |
| Taking it personally | Creates parental reactivity | Approach with curiosity |
| Viewing tantrums as manipulation | Misattributes intentionality to developmental limitation | Recognize as physiological regulation |
