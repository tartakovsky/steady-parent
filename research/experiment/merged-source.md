## Source 1: Big Little Feelings — Three-Step Tantrum Response

The three steps must be executed in sequence because each creates the precondition for the next. Allowing feelings creates receptivity; only then can boundaries be heard without escalation; and only after boundaries are stated does offering a "yes" have meaning as forward momentum rather than capitulation.

### Step 1: Allow the Feels

**Allowing feelings is not the same as accepting behavior.** You are not saying the tantrum itself is okay. You are communicating that the underlying emotional experience is valid and permitted. The tantrum is the expression; the feeling is what drives it. You address the feeling, not the expression.

Use **"I see"** and **"I hear"** as your primary validation tools. These phrases accomplish three things simultaneously:
1. They verbalize what is happening (naming the experience)
2. They communicate that you perceive the child (being seen)
3. They signal acceptance of the emotional state (okaying the feeling)

**Script:** "I hear you're frustrated because you don't want to take a nap. It's so tough, because you want to keep playing."
**Script:** "I can see you're upset about the green bowl. You feel sad, and it's OK to feel sad."
**Script:** "It's time to close the iPad now. I know you're disappointed... it can be so hard turning it off. I hear you want to watch another show."

Do not spend time trying to figure out why the tantrum is happening. The triggers often make no logical sense (crying because they received the blueberries they asked for, melting down over a cup they specifically pointed to, wailing about wanting to go outside while already outside). Skip the analysis and proceed directly to allowing the feelings.

### Step 2: State the Boundary

State the boundary **immediately** after okaying the feelings. No pause, no waiting to see if validation alone resolves the situation.

**Script:** "I hear you're frustrated because you don't want to take a nap. It's so tough, because you want to keep playing. **Right now it's time for a nap.**"
**Script:** "I can see you're upset about the green bowl. You feel sad, and it's OK to feel sad. **We are not getting another bowl right now.**"
**Script:** "It's time to close the iPad now. I know you're disappointed... it can be so hard turning it off. I hear you want to watch another show, and **it's time for dinner now.**"

You are not explaining the boundary. Explanations invite negotiation and suggest the boundary is open to discussion. You are not negotiating. The boundary is not a starting position for compromise. It is a statement of reality.

### Step 3: Shift to the Yes

The "yes" is not a reward, bribe, or major concession. It is simply something for the toddler to look forward to or have some say in. It shifts attention forward and returns a sense of agency to the child.

Offer a choice between two options. Toddlers crave power and control. A choice makes them feel "large and in charge" while keeping them within acceptable bounds.

**Script:** "Right now it's time for a nap. **Would you like to play on the swing or in the sandbox after your nap?**"
**Script:** "We are not getting another bowl right now. **What toy are you going to play with after we eat?**"
**Script:** "It's time for dinner now. **Would you like your Daniel Tiger cup or your Elsa cup at dinner?**"

### Anti-Patterns

- Dismissing or minimizing feelings escalates rather than de-escalates
- Trying to logic through the irrational trigger wastes time
- Explaining or justifying boundaries invites negotiation
- Stopping at validation without boundaries increases tantrum frequency
- The "yes" is not capitulation — it is redirecting to something acceptable

## Source 2: Nurtured First — Narrate, Wait, Connect

### What Does NOT Work
Logic and reasoning during dysregulation: children cannot process your words. Punishments and consequences: brain science shows during meltdowns children cannot process punishments. Both approaches are ineffective because the child's brain is not in a state capable of processing this information.

### Step 1: Narrate
Verbally describe out loud what your child is doing or feeling.
Purpose: (1) Allows children to feel understood, (2) Teaches children the vocabulary to express their own feelings over time.
**Script:** "I hear you! You wanted to play with the remote right now, and I couldn't let you play with it."

### Step 2: Wait
Remain in silence with your child instead of adding more words.
- Prioritize presence and body language over words
- Additional words can overload an already dysregulated nervous system
- Offer a hug or place a hand on their back while they release their tears
- You do NOT need to meet your child's every demand. Waiting does not mean giving in.
- By staying calm yourself, you model how to stay "calm, cool, collected" during uncomfortable feelings

### Step 3: Connect
After the intensity has passed:
1. Tell the story of what happened: "You were feeling really sad you couldn't have the remote. You let out your tears, and now you are feeling better!"
2. Offer a creative yes: "I can't let you play with the remote control, but YES, you can play with the car!"

Connect with what is happening underneath the behavior, not with the behavior itself.

### Anti-Patterns
- Do not expect logic to work during dysregulation
- Do not punish tantrums
- Do not add excessive words during the waiting phase
- Do not confuse waiting with meeting every demand
- Do not connect with the behavior; connect with the feeling underneath
- Do not view tantrums as manipulation or defiance

## Source 3: Nurtured First — Expert Tips

### Tip 1: Approach With Curiosity
The tantrum is not about you. Often it is not even about the apparent trigger.
Questions to ask yourself: "What's going on for my child right now?" / "When was the last time they ate and slept?" / "Have they had a busy day?" / "Do they need a break?" / "What are they trying to tell me?"
Transform from "this is being done to me" to "this is an opportunity to learn from my child."

### Tip 2: Practice the Art of "Being With"
- Stay physically near your toddler
- Minimize verbal input
- Add no new demands
- Communicate through presence that the child is seen

Mid-tantrum demands ("Mommy I need the bear... No Mommy no bear... Mommy I need milk... Mommy no milk") should not be acted upon. Acknowledge that you can discuss their requests once they are calm.

Offering your calm and demonstrating confidence in handling their big feelings is powerful. Co-regulation to self-regulation developmental pathway.

### Tip 3: The Louder They Talk, the Softer You Talk
When your child escalates volume, decrease your volume.
- Yelling backfires: child matches your tone, feels compelled to yell louder
- Speaking softly: child must tune in to hear you, must quiet their voice
- Children in emotional flooding cannot process complex language. Keep language minimal with short, clear directions.

### Tip 4: Teach Words and Skills After Calm Returns
Emotional regulation and verbalizing emotions are skills that must be taught, equivalent to brushing teeth or using a fork.
Post-tantrum: narrate and label what happened. Practice skills like asking for a break, taking space, deep breathing.

**Script:** "It's tough for you when Daddy has to leave for work. You feel sad that you can't go with."
**Script:** "You feel really mad with Tommy when he takes your toys, and it is tough. How can we tell Tommy how you feel?"

Your job is NOT to join your child's chaos. Your job IS to remain your child's calm in the chaos.

### What Works vs. What Fails
Effective: staying curious, physical presence without excessive verbal input, speaking softly, waiting until calm to teach, narrating experiences, offering consistent parental calm.
Ineffective: timeouts, spanking, yelling, adding demands during tantrum, following contradictory mid-tantrum requests, using complex language during flooding, taking it personally.

## Source 4: Nurtured First — Respond to Toddler Tantrums

### Strategy 1: Approach Tantrums with Curiosity
(Same content as Source 3 Tip 1 — self-inquiry questions during tantrum)

### Strategy 2: Practice the Art of "Being With"
(Same content as Source 3 Tip 2 — presence, no extra language, no new demands)

Contradictory requests mid-tantrum ("I need the bear... no bear... I need milk... no milk") are part of the tantrum itself, not genuine requests requiring response. Wait until calm to discuss.

### Strategy 3: The Louder They Talk, the Softer You Talk
(Same content as Source 3 Tip 3 — inverse volume matching, minimal language)

### Strategy 5: Distract, Keep Things Light, and Move Forward
Practical techniques:
- Do something silly
- Distract with another object
- Distract with a different conversation
- Change location (especially effective if tantrum is location or object specific)

What staying calm demonstrates: you can handle their emotions, their emotions are not scary to you, alternative ways of dealing with big feelings exist.

### Anti-Patterns Table
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Timeouts | Assumes self-regulation skills that don't exist | Stay present, "be with" |
| Spanking | Punishes lack of skill rather than teaching | Teach skills after calm |
| Yelling | Escalates volume matching | Speak quieter as they get louder |
| Acting on mid-tantrum demands | Demands are part of tantrum, not real requests | Wait until calm to discuss |
| Adding language during tantrum | Child cannot process complex language during flooding | Use minimal, short, clear directions |
| Taking it personally | Creates parental reactivity | Approach with curiosity |
