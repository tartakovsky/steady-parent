# Extracted Content from "How to Stop Your Toddler from Hitting"

## The CONNECT + CONTAIN Gameplan: A Three-Step Framework

This framework structures the in-the-moment response to hitting. The name emphasizes the dual goals: emotional connection with the child AND physical containment to maintain safety.

### Step 1: See Them (Connect with the Child's Experience)

The first action is to verbally acknowledge what the child is experiencing. The example script is: "I see you're so frustrated because he took your toy."

**Why this comes first**: This step contradicts how most adults were raised, where the first response to misbehavior was correction or punishment. The source directly asks: "Have you ever met a toddler who responded well to correction during a tantrum?" The implied answer is no, and this is used to justify prioritizing connection over correction.

**The logic**: During a tantrum, the toddler is not in a mental state where they can hear, process, or retain instructions. Attempting correction in this moment wastes the parent's effort and escalates the child's dysregulation. Instead, the parent's first task is to make the child feel seen, which begins the de-escalation process.

**What "seeing" accomplishes**: By naming what the child is experiencing, the parent demonstrates understanding. This shifts the dynamic from adversarial (parent vs. misbehaving child) to collaborative (parent helping child through a hard moment).

### Step 2: Okay the Feeling (Not the Behavior)

After seeing the child, the parent explicitly validates the emotion: "It's okay to feel angry and frustrated."

**The critical distinction**: The feeling is validated; the behavior is not. At no point does the parent say hitting is acceptable. But the emotion that triggered the hitting is acknowledged as legitimate.

**The psychological mechanism**: The source uses adult experience as an analogy. When someone is upset and hears "You're totally overreacting," defenses go up. When someone hears "That sounds really hard. It's okay to be upset about that," defenses lower automatically. This same dynamic operates with toddlers. Acknowledging the feeling reduces the child's need to escalate the behavior to prove the feeling is real.

**The difficulty factor**: The source explicitly notes this step is neither easy nor natural, especially for parents who were raised with a "stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about" approach. Practice is required to override ingrained patterns.

### Step 3: State the Boundary (Then Hold It Immediately)

The final step is communicating and enforcing the limit: "It's not okay to hit when you feel upset. I'm going to move brother over here to keep him safe."

**The boundary definition**: Boundaries are described as "non-negotiable rules that keep everybody safe." This framing positions boundaries not as arbitrary parental preferences but as safety requirements. Hitting is not just "against the rules"; it is dangerous.

**The timing and repetition problem**: The source identifies a common failure mode: saying "Stop hitting your brother" six times, then eventually yelling it. This pattern fails because the boundary is stated but not held. The child learns the rule has no teeth.

**The correction**: Hold the boundary "QUICKLY and CALMLY the FIRST TIME." Speed matters because delayed enforcement teaches the child that immediate compliance is optional. Calm matters because emotional escalation fuels the behavior.

**Physical intervention scripts for different scenarios**:

When the child hits a sibling: "It's not okay to hit when you feel upset. I'm going to move brother over here to keep him safe." The parent physically moves the other child to safety.

When the child hits the parent: "I won't let you hit me. I'm going to move my body over here to stay safe." The parent physically distances themselves.

When the child pursues after the parent moves away: "You're angry, and that's okay. It's not okay to hurt anyone with your body. I'm going to hold your hands down now to keep everyone safe." The parent gently wraps the child in a hug. This restraint prevents further hitting while maintaining physical closeness.

**The repetition requirement**: These three steps may need to be repeated several times during a single incident. This is described as "totes normal." The instruction is to enter "broken-record mode," channeling calm leadership and repeating the connect-contain cycle until the tantrum ends and everyone is safe.

## The Pre-Requisite: Finding Calm Before Acting

Before any intervention can occur, the parent must achieve internal calm. This is positioned as a **non-negotiable prerequisite**, not a nice-to-have. The phrase used is "before you ever open your mouth," emphasizing that speaking while dysregulated will undermine whatever words are chosen.

**The identity statement**: Parents should remind themselves "You are the calm, cool leader of your home." This is framed as a "capital-t Truth," suggesting it should function as an internalized identity, not just a situational tactic. The parent's role is leadership, and leaders set emotional tone rather than matching the emotional chaos around them.

**Practical techniques offered**:
- Take a deep breath
- Sniff essential oil
- Go to a mental happy place

The specifics matter less than the function: anything that reduces blood pressure and shifts the parent into a regulated state. The key is that this happens BEFORE engagement, not during.

## Post-Incident Teaching: The Piece That Creates Long-Term Change

Stopping hitting in the moment addresses the immediate crisis but does not prevent future occurrences. The source emphasizes that without teaching alternative behaviors, the hitting will "keep happening and keep happening and keep happening."

**The timing principle**: Teaching happens "much, MUCH later," when everyone is calm and happy. This is not minutes later while the child is still recovering; it is potentially hours later, in a completely different emotional context. The child must be regulated enough to learn.

**The teaching script**: "Earlier today, you were so mad when brother took your toy. It's okay to feel mad. It's not okay to hit. When you feel mad, what are some things you can do instead of hitting?"

**The structure of this script**:
1. Reference the specific incident (grounds the conversation in real experience)
2. Revalidate the feeling (reinforces that the emotion was legitimate)
3. Restate the boundary (reinforces that the behavior was not acceptable)
4. Ask for alternatives (engages the child in problem-solving rather than lecturing)

**Why asking instead of telling**: By asking the child what they can do instead, the parent engages the child's own thinking. The child generates options rather than receiving mandates, which increases buy-in and retention. The child becomes an active participant in their own behavioral development.

**The long-term framing**: What happens outside the tantrum "sets up your child for life-long emotional health and resilience." This frames the post-incident teaching not as punishment or rehashing but as building durable skills the child will carry into adulthood.

## Expectations and Mindset Management

**Initial difficulty is normal**: The source explicitly states the approach "will be challenging at first." Parents should not expect immediate mastery.

**Testing will occur**: "Will your toddler push back to see if you're for real? One hundo p." Children will test whether the parent truly means the boundary. This testing is expected and does not indicate failure; it indicates the child is checking whether the new approach is consistent.

**Consistency is required**: The payoff comes from "hard work and consistency." The techniques work cumulatively over time, not instantly.

**The ultimate outcome**: The goal is not just stopping hitting but watching the toddler "become emotionally healthy." This positions the approach as building emotional intelligence, not just managing behavior.
