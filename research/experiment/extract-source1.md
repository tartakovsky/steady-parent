# How to Manage a Tantrum Already in Progress

## Core Framework: The Three-Step Tantrum Response

The three steps must be executed in sequence because each creates the precondition for the next. Allowing feelings creates receptivity; only then can boundaries be heard without escalation; and only after boundaries are stated does offering a "yes" have meaning as forward momentum rather than capitulation.

## Step 1: Allow the Feels

### The Distinction Between Feelings and Behavior

**Allowing feelings is not the same as accepting behavior.** This is a critical paradigm shift. You are not saying the tantrum itself is okay. You are communicating that the underlying emotional experience is valid and permitted. The tantrum is the expression; the feeling is what drives it. You address the feeling, not the expression.

### The Magic Phrases

Use **"I see"** and **"I hear"** as your primary validation tools. These phrases accomplish three things simultaneously:
1. They verbalize what is happening (naming the experience)
2. They communicate that you perceive the child (being seen)
3. They signal acceptance of the emotional state (okaying the feeling)

### Scripted Examples and What They Demonstrate

**Example 1:** "I hear you're frustrated because you don't want to take a nap. It's so tough, because you want to keep playing."

This demonstrates: naming the feeling (frustrated), identifying the trigger (not wanting to nap), acknowledging the underlying desire (wanting to play), and expressing empathy for the conflict (it's so tough).

**Example 2:** "I can see you're upset about the green bowl. You feel sad, and it's OK to feel sad."

This demonstrates: observation-based language ("I can see"), naming the emotion (upset, sad), explicit permission for the feeling ("it's OK to feel sad").

**Example 3:** "It's time to close the iPad now. I know you're disappointed... it can be so hard turning it off. I hear you want to watch another show."

This demonstrates: stating the situation, naming the feeling (disappointed), validating the difficulty ("it can be so hard"), acknowledging the desire (wanting another show).

### Important Caveat: Don't Try to Understand "Why"

Do not spend time trying to figure out why the tantrum is happening. The triggers often make no logical sense (crying because they received the blueberries they asked for, melting down over a cup they specifically pointed to, wailing about wanting to go outside while already outside). The "why" is frequently unknowable and irrelevant to resolution. Skip the analysis and proceed directly to allowing the feelings.

## Step 2: State the Boundary

### Timing Is Critical

State the boundary **immediately** after okaying the feelings. There is no pause, no waiting to see if validation alone resolves the situation. The two components are delivered as a connected sequence.

### Scripted Examples With Boundaries Added

**Example 1:** "I hear you're frustrated because you don't want to take a nap. It's so tough, because you want to keep playing. **Right now it's time for a nap.**"

**Example 2:** "I can see you're upset about the green bowl. You feel sad, and it's OK to feel sad. **We are not getting another bowl right now.**"

**Example 3:** "It's time to close the iPad now. I know you're disappointed... it can be so hard turning it off. I hear you want to watch another show, and **it's time for dinner now.**"

### What You Are NOT Doing

**You are not explaining the boundary.** You do not justify why naptime is necessary or why dinner needs to happen now. Explanations invite negotiation and suggest the boundary is open to discussion.

**You are not negotiating.** The boundary is not a starting position for compromise. It is a statement of reality.

You are simply restating where the limits are so the child knows them. This is communication, not debate.

## Step 3: Shift to the Yes

### What the "Yes" Actually Is

The "yes" is not a reward, bribe, or major concession. **It is simply something for the toddler to look forward to or have some say in.** It shifts attention forward and returns a sense of agency to the child.

### The Choice Technique

The preferred method for delivering the "yes" is offering a choice between two options. This works because toddlers crave power and control. A choice makes them feel "large and in charge" while actually keeping them within acceptable bounds you have set. The choice also moves the tantrum toward resolution by redirecting focus from what they cannot have to what they can have or decide.

### Scripted Examples With "Yes" Added

**Example 1:** "I hear you're frustrated because you don't want to take a nap. It's so tough, because you want to keep playing. Right now it's time for a nap. **Would you like to play on the swing or in the sandbox after your nap?**"

This demonstrates: offering a choice about a future activity, redirecting attention to post-nap possibilities.

**Example 2:** "I can see you're upset about the green bowl. You feel sad, and it's OK to feel sad. We are not getting another bowl right now. **What toy are you going to play with after we eat?**"

This demonstrates: offering agency about a future decision, shifting focus from the denied bowl to something pleasant after the meal.

**Example 3:** "It's time to close the iPad now. I know you're disappointed... it can be so hard turning it off. I hear you want to watch another show, and it's time for dinner now. **Would you like your Daniel Tiger cup or your Elsa cup at dinner?**"

This demonstrates: offering a choice within the required activity (dinner), giving control over a small detail while the main boundary (iPad off, dinner time) remains firm.

## Anti-Patterns: What Not to Do

### Dismissing or Minimizing Feelings

Telling a child (or anyone) that their feelings are not a big deal or that they should "just get over it" escalates rather than de-escalates. It makes the person feel unheard and increases emotional intensity.

### Trying to Logic Through It

Attempting to understand or explain the irrational trigger wastes time and energy. The triggers often make no sense. Skip the "why" entirely.

### Explaining or Justifying Boundaries

Explanations suggest boundaries are negotiable. They invite debate. Simply state the boundary as fact without defense.

### Stopping at Validation

Allowing feelings without following up with boundaries creates a problematic pattern. The child learns that expressing big emotions gets them what they want, which increases tantrum frequency.

### Viewing "Yes" as Caving

The "yes" in step three is not capitulation. It is not giving the child what they originally demanded. It is redirecting to something acceptable that returns a sense of choice and forward momentum.
