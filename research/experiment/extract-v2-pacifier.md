## Handling Emotional Responses

### Understanding the Gift's Purpose

The physical gift exchanged for the pacifiers is NOT a bribe. Its purpose is to provide the child with an actual, tangible item to hold when they feel sad about the pacifiers being gone. This is a **coping strategy**, not a reward. The distinction matters because it shapes how parents should frame and use the gift afterward.

### When Children Express Sadness During PREP

If the child expresses upset feelings about the upcoming change, parents should:

1. **Affirm the mixed feelings**: Acknowledge that the child can feel excited AND sad simultaneously. Example: "It sounds like you're excited for the Paci Fairy to come, and you're also feeling sad about your pacifiers."

2. **Validate the difficult emotion**: State explicitly that feeling sad is okay and acceptable.

3. **Connect back to PREP materials**: Reference what characters in the books did when they felt sad. Example: "Remember what the little boy/girl did in our books when they felt sad about it? Yes! They hugged their stuffy really tight."

This approach teaches children that their emotions are valid while also modeling coping strategies.

### When Children Miss Their Pacifier After the Transition

**In-the-moment comfort approach**:

1. **Acknowledge the feeling**: "I hear you're missing your paci."

2. **Validate the emotion**: "You're feeling sad, and it's okay to feel sad."

3. **Connect to the new situation**: "You gave them to the paci fairy and now you have this toy."

4. **Allow the feelings to flow**: Letting children release their emotions, including crying, is healthy. Do not try to shut down or rush past the emotional experience.

5. **Remind them of coping skills from PREP books**:
   - Holding and hugging their lovey
   - Drawing a picture of their feelings
   - Blowing bubbles (pretend is acceptable)

## Key Principles and Patterns

### Emotional Validation

Throughout the process, the approach emphasizes validating all emotions rather than dismissing negative feelings. This includes:
- Explicitly stating that sadness is okay
- Acknowledging mixed feelings (excited AND sad)
- Allowing crying rather than trying to stop it
- Providing physical comfort objects and activities

The underlying belief is that emotions need to be felt and released, not suppressed or avoided.

### Safety Through Predictability

The emphasis on extreme detail when explaining what will happen reflects a fundamental principle: toddlers feel safe when they know what to expect. Uncertainty is inherently anxiety-producing. By making the unknown known through detailed explanation, parents remove a significant source of resistance.

### Control and Agency

A recurring theme is giving the child a sense of control. This appears in:
- Having the child physically gather the pacifiers
- Having the child decorate the envelope
- Having the child place the package on the porch
- Framing it as "their idea"

This works because toddlers are in a developmental stage where autonomy and control are deeply important. When they feel in charge, they are more cooperative. When they feel things are being done to them, they resist.
