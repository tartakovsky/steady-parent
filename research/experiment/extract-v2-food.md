## Emotional Regulation as Foundation

Your reaction to a toddler's behavior either encourages or discourages that behavior from recurring. This creates a feedback loop: the toddler brain interprets any significant parental response as attention, and toddlers crave attention regardless of whether it is positive (praise) or negative (yelling, pleading, frustration).

When a parent offers what the source calls a "biiiiiiiiig response," the toddler's brain registers that they got lots of attention. Even shouting feeds the same attention reward system as positive engagement would.

## Step 1: Play It Cool

Emotional regulation in the parent is the prerequisite for everything that follows. An escalated parent cannot deliver the script effectively, and an escalated response feeds the attention-seeking behavior the parent is trying to eliminate.

The challenge is staying calm while facing repeated provocation is genuinely difficult. The source frames this as rising up "like the warrior parent you are," positioning emotional control as an act of strength rather than passivity.

## Narration Component (Acknowledging the Behavior)

State what you observe in a calm voice: "I see you throwing your cheerios on the floor."

The purpose of narration is to make absolutely clear which specific behavior is unacceptable. Toddlers may not automatically understand which of their many actions triggered the parental response. Explicit narration eliminates ambiguity.

## What NOT To Do (Anti-Patterns)

**Do not give big reactions:** Yelling, pleading, begging, expressing visible frustration, or showing any dramatic emotional response feeds the behavior you want to eliminate.

**Do not scold or lecture:** Extended lectures become another form of "big reaction."

**Do not confuse consequence with punishment:** The psychological frame matters. This is cause and effect, not retribution.

## Age-Appropriate Considerations

Younger toddlers are more likely to perceive big reactions as a fun game.

Younger toddlers need significantly simplified scripts.

Hand gestures should accompany verbal communication for younger children.
