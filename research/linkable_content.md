# Linkable Content Assets

Content that naturally attracts backlinks because people want to reference, embed, or share it.

**Why this matters:** Other sites link to useful tools and reference resources. Bloggers write "I took this quiz" posts. Journalists cite statistics pages. This builds backlinks passively.

## The Meta-Asset: Parenting Scripts Database

**Concept:** Searchable database of "what to say when..." covering hundreds of situations.

### Example Entries
- What to say when: child hits sibling
- What to say when: child says "I hate you"
- What to say when: child refuses to share
- What to say when: child lies
- What to say when: child won't get dressed
- What to say when: child has a meltdown in public
- What to say when: child asks about death
- What to say when: siblings are fighting
- etc.

### Why It's Extremely Linkable
- It's THE reference resource
- Every parenting blogger would link to "here's a database of scripts for every situation"
- High utility - parents return repeatedly
- Already have this content in extracts - just needs restructuring

### Implementation
- Searchable by situation, age, behavior type
- Each entry: situation → what to say → why it works → what not to say
- Filter by parenting approach (for different brands)

## Cross-Brand Asset Strategy

Some assets work across all brands (shared infrastructure):
- Milestone tracker
- Sleep calculator
- Chore generator

Some assets are brand-specific:
- Cycle Breaker: patterns quiz, healing assessments
- Nerd Parent: evidence checker, research summaries
- Conservative: character-building assessments
- Grandparents: then-vs-now comparisons

Shared assets can exist on each brand's domain with different styling/voice, or be a neutral tool that all brands link to.
