## Major Cross-Link Pathways

1. **The Behavior Chain**: Tantrums -> Hitting -> Discipline -> Parent Regulation -> Repair -> Connection
   - A parent searching for tantrum help will naturally flow into discipline philosophy, then into "how do I stay calm," then into "how do I repair after I lose it"

2. **The Anxiety Web**: Anxiety -> Sleep (bedtime fears) -> School (refusal) -> Separation -> Social
   - Anxious kids show up in many contexts; each cluster handles the context-specific angle

3. **The New Baby Highway**: Postpartum -> Siblings -> Sleep Regression -> Tantrums (jealousy) -> Parent Regulation (overwhelm)
   - A parent with a new baby will touch at least 4-5 clusters

4. **The Age Escalation Path**: Postpartum -> Toddler behaviors (Tantrums, Hitting, Potty) -> School-age (School, Friendships, Emotional Intelligence) -> Teens
   - Parents re-enter the content ecosystem at each developmental stage

5. **The Philosophy Spine**: Parenting Approach -> Discipline -> Emotional Intelligence -> Connection -> Every specific behavior
   - Parents who start with "what kind of parent do I want to be?" flow into practical application

# Coverage Gaps

Topics parents commonly search for that have **thin or no coverage** in the source material:

1. **ADHD and neurodivergent-specific strategies** -- Several titles mention "differently wired kids," ODD, OCD, sensory issues, and Tourette's, but there's no systematic coverage. These are extremely high-search-volume topics. Consider a dedicated cluster or comprehensive subcategory once original content is created.

2. **Co-parenting logistics** -- Divorce appears in ~10 titles, but specific co-parenting mechanics (schedules, communication tools, parallel parenting) are thin. High demand topic.

3. **Dad-specific content** -- Only 3-4 titles address fatherhood directly. Search volume for "dad parenting tips," "stay-at-home dad," and "father-child bond" is significant.

4. **Multilingual and multicultural parenting** -- Zero coverage. Growing search demand.

5. **Child's academic struggles** -- Homework battles appear a few times, but learning disabilities, reading struggles, math anxiety, and gifted education are largely absent.

6. **Toddler speech and language delays** -- One title about "not talking yet," but speech delay is a top parent concern with high search volume.

7. **Gender identity and LGBTQ+ family topics** -- One title about nonbinary kids, one about clothing preferences. Very thin for a topic with growing search interest.

8. **Single parent-specific strategies** -- Mentioned in passing but no dedicated coverage. Different challenges (no co-regulator, financial stress, dating as a parent).

9. **Regression behaviors** -- Sleep regression is covered, but general regression (new baby, trauma, life change) could be its own subcategory.

10. **Picky eating deep dives** -- Only ~5-6 food titles. This is one of the most-searched parenting topics and could support a dedicated 10-article series with more source material.

# Merge/Split Decisions

### Decisions Made

1. **SPLIT: "Challenging Behaviors" (v1 #13) into three clusters**
   - **Whining, Lying & Everyday Behaviors (#18)** -- These are annoying-but-normal behaviors with distinct search intents ("how to stop whining," "why does my kid lie"). They deserve their own cluster because the parent mindset is different from tantrums or aggression.
   - **Strong-Willed, Spirited & Sensitive Kids (#19)** -- "My regular kid is whining" and "my kid is MORE of everything" are fundamentally different problems. Spirited kid content crosses every behavioral cluster and needs its own home.
   - **Potty Talk and Body Curiosity moved to Potty Training (#9)** -- Natural search pathway: parents searching potty content are the same ones dealing with potty talk.

2. **SPLIT: "Developmental Stages" (v1 #11) dissolved across clusters**
   - v1 had a "Developmental Stages" cluster, but age is a modifier, not a category. The content was redistributed: baby development went into Postpartum (#15), toddler/preschooler development is handled within each behavioral cluster, and tweens/teens got their own cluster (#16) because the parenting approach differs so much.

3. **MERGED: "Attachment & Connection" (v1 #12) + Play + Routines into "Play, Connection & Daily Routines" (#13)**
   - Attachment theory, special time, play, and routines all serve the same parent need: "how do I stay close to my kid?" Keeping them separate would create thin clusters. The combined cluster has ~55 articles of coverage and represents a cohesive search intent around closeness and daily family life.

4. **SPLIT: "Body Safety" (v1 #16) expanded to include Hard Conversations (#14)**
   - Body safety alone had only ~12 articles. By adding "hard conversations" (death, divorce, race, world events, Santa), the cluster grows to ~25 articles and serves the unified parent need: "how do I talk about scary/difficult/sensitive stuff?" The search intent is the same parental anxiety: "I need to have a hard conversation and I'm afraid of getting it wrong."

5. **NEW CLUSTER: "Raising Tweens & Teens" (#16)**
   - v1 had teens as a subcategory under "Developmental Stages." But parenting a 14-year-old is so different from parenting a 4-year-old that the strategies, language, and parent mindset diverge completely. With ~25 articles of source material, this justifies its own cluster. Every tween/teen search query ("my teenager won't talk to me," "discipline for teens," "teen anger") is a distinct intent from the toddler versions.

6. **KEPT SEPARATE: Tantrums (#1) vs. Hitting (#2)**
   - These overlap (aggressive tantrums include hitting), but the parent's felt problem is different. "My kid melts down" and "my kid hits" trigger different Google searches, different shame responses, and different intervention strategies. The line: if the core issue is emotional overwhelm expressed physically, it's a tantrum. If the core issue is intentional physical aggression (even impulsive), it's hitting. Cross-links handle the overlap.

7. **KEPT SEPARATE: Discipline (#6) vs. Parenting Philosophy (#20)**
   - Discipline is tactical: "what do I DO when my kid won't listen?" Philosophy is strategic: "what kind of parent do I want to be?" The parent searching "alternatives to time-out" has a different intent from the parent searching "is gentle parenting research-based?" Philosophy content is evergreen/foundational; discipline content is situational/actionable.

8. **MERGED: Eating (#10) stays small rather than merging with a larger cluster**
   - With only ~20 articles, Eating is the smallest standalone cluster. I considered merging it into a "Daily Life" super-cluster, but eating problems are such a distinct and high-volume search topic ("picky eater help," "toddler won't eat") that keeping it separate preserves SEO clarity. If source coverage grows, this cluster can expand.

9. **KEPT SEPARATE: Screen Time (#11) despite being small (~15 articles)**
   - Screen time is one of the most searched modern parenting topics. Even with thin source coverage, the search intent is so distinct and the topic so commercially valuable (affiliate potential for monitoring apps, alternative toys) that it deserves its own URL space. Content creation should prioritize filling this cluster.

10. **NEW CLUSTER: Strong-Willed, Spirited & Sensitive Kids (#19)**
    - This was a subcategory in v1's "Developmental Stages." But ~25 articles address the "my kid is MORE" parent experience, and these parents feel like regular parenting advice doesn't apply to them. This is a powerful positioning cluster: it signals that Steady Parent understands their specific struggle. Every other cluster can cross-link into this one with a "for spirited kids" angle.
