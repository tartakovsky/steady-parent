              TANTRUM RESET CHEAT SHEET
              The Steady Parent Method
================================================================================

Save this. Screenshot it. Use it in the moment.

Based on: Regulate-Relate-Reason (Bruce Perry), Polyvagal Theory,
Attachment Theory

================================================================================
THE 60-SECOND RESET
================================================================================

STEP 1: REGULATE YOURSELF FIRST (10-15 seconds)
-----------------------------------------------
- Drop your shoulders away from your ears
- Unclench your jaw
- Take ONE slow breath out (exhale longer than inhale)
- Plant your feet firmly on the ground
- Soften your face

Your calm is contagious. Their storm needs your anchor.


STEP 2: CONNECT BRIEFLY (15-20 seconds)
-----------------------------------------------
- Get low (crouch or sit to their level)
- Open your body posture (no crossed arms)
- Soft eye contact if they can tolerate it
- Stay within arm's reach but don't force touch
- Match your energy DOWN, not their energy UP


STEP 3: HOLD THE BOUNDARY (20-30 seconds)
-----------------------------------------------
Say ONE thing, then wait:

"I won't let you [hit/throw/hurt]. I'm staying right here."

Then: STOP TALKING. Breathe. Wait. Repeat only if needed.

The boundary stays. Your presence stays. Words can wait.


================================================================================
WHAT TO SAY (Pick One)
================================================================================

[  ] "I'm here. I'm staying with you."

[  ] "I won't let you hurt yourself/me/your sister."

[  ] "This is really hard. I get it."

[  ] "I'm going to keep you safe."

[  ] "You're allowed to be upset. I'm not leaving."

[  ] "I hear you. This is a big feeling."


KEY: Short. Warm. Repeat if needed. Don't explain or lecture.


================================================================================
WHAT NOT TO SAY (And Why It Backfires)
================================================================================

X  "Stop crying right now."
   --> Signals their emotions are wrong/unsafe to express

X  "You're fine. It's not a big deal."
   --> Dismisses their experience, increases disconnection

X  "If you don't stop, I'm going to..."
   --> Threats escalate arousal, they can't process logic

X  "You're being ridiculous/dramatic."
   --> Shame increases dysregulation, damages trust

X  "Use your words!"
   --> Impossible when flooded; language centers offline

X  "I'll give you something to cry about."
   --> Fear doesn't teach regulation, just suppression


================================================================================
BODY RESET FOR PARENTS (Do While Supervising)
================================================================================

1. LONG EXHALE
   - Breathe in for 4 counts
   - Breathe out for 6-8 counts
   - Activates your parasympathetic nervous system
   - Do 2-3 rounds

2. GROUND YOUR FEET
   - Press all four corners of your feet into the floor
   - Wiggle your toes inside your shoes
   - Feel the solid ground beneath you
   - This anchors you in the present moment

3. COLD WATER RESET
   - Run cold water on your inner wrists (10 seconds)
   - OR press a cold glass to your face/neck
   - Triggers the dive reflex, slows heart rate
   - Works even mid-chaos


================================================================================
AFTER THE STORM (Repair Steps)
================================================================================

WAIT until they're fully calm (watch for:)
- Breathing slows
- Body relaxes
- Eye contact returns
- They might seek closeness

THEN (not before):

1. RECONNECT PHYSICALLY
   - Offer a hug, back rub, or just sit close
   - Let them initiate or accept your offer
   - No words needed yet

2. NAME IT SIMPLY
   - "That was a big one."
   - "Your body was really upset."
   - No need to analyze or lecture

3. REPAIR IF NEEDED
   - If you yelled or lost it: "I got too loud. I'm sorry."
   - Model owning your part without over-explaining
   - Shows ruptures can be repaired

4. MOVE ON
   - Don't rehash or extract promises
   - Return to normal activity
   - Connection is the lesson


================================================================================
REMEMBER
================================================================================

- You cannot reason with a dysregulated brain
- Connection must come BEFORE correction
- Your regulation IS the intervention
- The relationship matters more than this moment
- "Not yet" is different from "never"
- You're doing harder work than it looks


================================================================================
Quick Reference: The Sequence
================================================================================

    REGULATE (you)  -->  RELATE (connect)  -->  REASON (later)

    You can't calm        You can't teach       Logic comes back
    them if you're        through a wall.       when the storm
    not calm.             Get close first.      passes.
