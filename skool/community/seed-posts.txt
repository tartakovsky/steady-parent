TITLE: My 5yo hit her brother and laughed. What do I say?

My daughter (5) hit her little brother (3) during playtime and when I told her that wasn't okay, she laughed in my face. I completely lost it and yelled. Now I feel terrible but I also don't know what I should have done differently.

What do you actually say in that moment? I froze and then exploded.

---

REPLY 1 (Parent):
Oh man, the laughing is SO triggering. My son does this too. I learned in Module 3 that the laugh is often a stress response—they don't actually think it's funny. Their nervous system is dysregulated too.

What helped me: I get down to his level, make eye contact, and say "I won't let you hit. Hitting hurts." Then I physically move him away from his sister. Short, calm, done. The lecture comes later when everyone's regulated.

---

REPLY 2 (Parent):
The laughing used to send me over the edge every time. Now I literally say out loud (to myself, but they can hear): "She's not laughing because it's funny. She's nervous." It helps ME stay calm, which is half the battle.

---

REPLY 3 (Admin):
Great responses here. A few things to remember:

1. The laugh is a nervous system response, not disrespect
2. In the moment, keep it short: "I won't let you hit."
3. Physically separate if needed
4. Address it later when everyone is calm

Check out the script in Resources called "When Your Child Hurts Someone"—it walks through exactly what to say in the moment and in the follow-up conversation.

TITLE: Bedtime is a nightmare - she leaves her room 10+ times

Every. Single. Night. My 6yo gets out of bed constantly. She needs water, she's scared, she heard a noise, she has a question about tomorrow. I've tried being patient, I've tried consequences, I've tried yelling (not proud of that one). Nothing works and by 9pm I'm completely depleted.

Anyone crack this one?

---

REPLY 1 (Parent):
We dealt with this for MONTHS. What finally worked was a really boring, broken-record response. Every time she came out, I walked her back with zero conversation. Just: "It's sleep time" in the most monotone voice. No eye contact, no engagement. It took about a week but she stopped because it wasn't giving her anything.

---

REPLY 2 (Parent):
We added a "bedtime ticket" system. She gets two tickets per night. Each time she comes out, she gives up a ticket. If she still has tickets in the morning, she gets an extra story the next night. It gamified it in a way that worked for her personality.

---

REPLY 3 (Admin):
Bedtime battles are exhausting. A few things to consider:

- Is she getting enough connection time before bed? Sometimes the exits are bids for more of you.
- Is the boundary clear? She needs to know exactly what happens when she leaves.
- Are you consistent? Same response, every time, no matter what.

The "boring response" approach mentioned above is gold. Your calm, consistent response teaches her that leaving the room doesn't get her what she wants (more time with you).

TITLE: I stayed calm during a full grocery store meltdown

I need to share this because two months ago this would have ended with me dragging my kid out while whisper-yelling through clenched teeth.

My 4yo lost it in the checkout line because I wouldn't buy candy. Full screaming, on the floor, the whole thing. And I just... stayed calm. I got down to his level, acknowledged he was upset, and quietly said "I hear you. You really wanted that. The answer is still no."

An older woman gave me a dirty look. I didn't care. My son calmed down faster than he ever has before. We walked out holding hands.

I'm not saying I've figured this out. But today was proof that the work is working.

---

REPLY 1 (Parent):
This made me tear up. The dirty looks are the worst but you handled it perfectly. The calmer you stayed, the faster he came back to you. That's the magic.

---

REPLY 2 (Parent):
"The answer is still no" delivered calmly is EVERYTHING. It's firm and it's kind. This is the goal right here.

---

REPLY 3 (Admin):
This is exactly what we mean by "calm is your superpower." You didn't give in. You didn't escalate. You held the boundary AND the connection. That's the whole method in one moment. Thank you for sharing this.

TITLE: My son used words instead of hitting for the first time

Small win but I'm counting it. My 7yo has always been physical when he's frustrated—pushing, hitting, throwing things. We've been working on "Use your words, not your hands" for what feels like forever.

Yesterday his sister took his toy and instead of shoving her, he yelled "THAT'S MINE AND I'M MAD!"

Was it loud? Yes. Was it aggressive? Kind of. But he didn't hit. He used words. I'll take it.

---

REPLY 1 (Parent):
That's not a small win, that's a HUGE win! The fact that he had enough regulation to choose words over actions in a heated moment? That's real progress. Celebrate this one.

---

REPLY 2 (Parent):
"I'M MAD" is beautiful. Seriously. He identified and expressed his emotion. That's exactly what we want.

TITLE: Script: What to say when your child says "I HATE YOU"

[ADMIN POST]

This one stings. But here's the thing—when your child says "I hate you," they're not giving you information about their feelings toward you. They're telling you they're overwhelmed and don't have better words.

HERE'S THE SCRIPT:

In the moment (stay calm, soften your face):
"You're really upset right now. It's okay to be angry. It's not okay to say hurtful things."

If they keep going:
"I'm going to give you some space. I'll be here when you're ready."

Later, when everyone is calm:
"Earlier you said you hated me. I know you were really upset. Do you want to talk about what was going on for you?"

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- Don't say "You don't mean that" (invalidates their feelings)
- Don't lecture in the moment (they can't hear you when flooded)
- Don't take it personally (easier said than done, I know)

Remember: Your calm response teaches them that big feelings don't break the relationship.

Save this one. You'll need it.

TITLE: The 3-Step Reset: What to do AFTER you yell

[ADMIN POST]

You're going to yell sometimes. It happens to all of us. What matters is what you do next.

THE 3-STEP RESET:

1. REGULATE YOURSELF FIRST
Step away if you need to. Take 5 deep breaths. Splash water on your face. You cannot repair from a dysregulated state.

2. REPAIR WITH YOUR CHILD
Get on their level. Say: "I yelled at you and that wasn't okay. You didn't deserve that. I'm sorry."

Don't add "but you made me..." That's not an apology, that's blame.

3. REFLECT (LATER, ON YOUR OWN)
What happened before the yell? Were you hungry, tired, touched-out? What need wasn't being met?

Your yelling is information. Not about your child's behavior—about your state.

---

This doesn't mean yelling is fine. It means ruptures can be repaired. And modeling repair is one of the most powerful things you can teach your child.

TITLE: He only acts out with me, never with his dad

My 8yo is completely different with my husband. Calm, cooperative, listens the first time. With me? Constant pushback, arguments, meltdowns. I'm the one doing all the emotional labor and I'm the one getting punished for it.

Is this normal? What am I doing wrong?

---

REPLY 1 (Parent):
THIS. My daughter is the same way. Her therapist told me that kids often save their hardest emotions for the parent they feel safest with. It's actually a sign of secure attachment. Cold comfort when you're in the trenches, I know.

---

REPLY 2 (Parent):
You're not doing anything wrong. You're probably the primary caregiver, which means you're the safe space to fall apart. It's exhausting and unfair. Make sure you're getting breaks and that your husband is taking on some of the heavy lifting.

---

REPLY 3 (Admin):
This is one of the most common things we hear, and it's so painful. A few things:

1. Kids do often "save" their big feelings for the safest parent
2. You might be more depleted, which makes staying calm harder
3. Your husband might have different energy (less history of power struggles)

None of this means you're doing it wrong. It means you need more support and more breaks. Is your husband aware of how different the dynamic is? Sometimes they genuinely don't see it.

TITLE: New here - mom of a "spirited" 4yo

Hi everyone. I'm Sarah, mom to a very strong-willed 4yo boy and a 7 month old.

I found this course after a particularly bad week where I yelled so much I lost my voice. Not my proudest moment. My son is smart, funny, and exhausting. Every transition is a battle. Every "no" leads to a meltdown. I feel like I'm failing him.

I'm hoping to find some tools that actually work and maybe feel a little less alone in this. Looking forward to learning from all of you.

---

REPLY 1 (Parent):
Welcome Sarah! You're definitely not alone. Spirited kids are HARD. But they're also incredible once you figure out how they work. This community has been a game changer for me. Start with Module 1—understanding your own triggers was huge for me.

---

REPLY 2 (Parent):
Mom of a spirited 5yo here. The transition struggles are so real. Check out the "transition warnings" strategy in Module 4—it was the first thing that actually helped us. You've got this.

---

REPLY 3 (Admin):
Welcome, Sarah. You're in the right place. Spirited kids push us to our edges, but they also respond really well to the approach we teach here—firm boundaries held with calm, consistent energy.

Start with Module 1 and come back here with questions. We're here for you.
