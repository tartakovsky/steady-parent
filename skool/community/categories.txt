COMMUNITY CATEGORIES

---

1. WINS & PROGRESS
Share your breakthroughs, big or small. First time you stayed calm during a meltdown? Your kid used their words instead of hitting? A bedtime that actually worked? We want to hear it. Your wins inspire others.

---

2. HELP & TROUBLESHOOTING
Stuck on a specific situation? Post it here. Share what happened, what you tried, and what went wrong. The community (and our team) will help you troubleshoot with scripts and strategies that actually work.

3. INTRODUCTIONS
New here? Tell us about yourself and your family. We'd love to know what brought you here and what you're hoping to work on. No pressure to share more than you're comfortable with.

4. RESOURCES & SCRIPTS
Ready-to-use scripts, printables, and quick reference guides. Check here for tools you can use in the moment—what to say when your kid hits, refuses to listen, or melts down in public.
