LESSON 6: Why They Don't Listen (And How to Fix It)

You've said it five times. They haven't moved. You're getting louder. They're still playing. Eventually you snap, they cry, and everyone feels terrible.

Sound familiar?

"They don't listen" is one of the most common parenting complaints. But here's the thing: it's rarely about listening. It's about a breakdown somewhere in the communication-to-compliance chain. And once you understand where the breakdown is, you can fix it.

The Five Real Reasons They Ignore You:

1. Attention Competition
Their brain is focused on something else—a game, a show, their thoughts. Adele Diamond's research on executive function shows that children have limited cognitive resources for attention switching. They're not ignoring you to be defiant; they literally didn't process what you said.

Fix: Get their attention first. Move close, make eye contact, say their name. Wait until you have acknowledgment before giving the instruction.

2. Cognitive Overload
You gave too many instructions at once, or the task is more complex than their working memory can hold. "Go upstairs, brush your teeth, put on pajamas, pick out clothes for tomorrow, and come back down" is at least three instructions too many for most kids under eight.

Fix: One instruction at a time. Or use visual checklists for routines.

3. Autonomy Needs
Kids—especially between ages 2-5 and again in adolescence—have a developmental need to feel some control. Constant directives without choice feel oppressive. They push back not because they don't want to comply, but because they want some say.

Fix: Offer limited choices within your boundaries. "Do you want to brush teeth first or put on pajamas first?" Both options achieve your goal.

4. No Reason to Comply
From their perspective, there's no incentive to stop what they're enjoying. The natural consequence of ignoring you (you eventually give up or do it for them) is better than complying.

Fix: Make follow-through reliable. If ignoring works even sometimes, they'll keep trying it.

5. Inconsistency
You've said things you didn't mean before. You've threatened consequences you didn't deliver. They've learned that your words don't always match reality, so they wait to see if you're serious this time.

Fix: Say less. Mean what you say. Follow through every time.

How to Give Instructions That Actually Work:

1. Proximity and connection first
Don't yell from another room. Get close. Make eye contact. Touch their shoulder if appropriate.

2. Use statements, not questions
"Put your shoes on" not "Can you put your shoes on?" Questions invite "no."

3. Give them a moment
Young children have slower processing speed. After you give an instruction, wait 5-10 seconds before repeating.

4. Reduce competing stimuli
Pause the show. Put down the toy. Make compliance the path of least resistance.

5. Acknowledge before redirecting
"I know you're in the middle of something. In two minutes, we need to leave."

Scripts to Use:

Getting attention:
- "[Name], I need your eyes."
- "Stop and look at me for a second."
- "I'm going to tell you something important."

Giving instructions:
- "It's time to put on shoes."
- "Teeth brushed in the next five minutes."
- "Please hand me that."

When they don't respond:
- "I asked you to put on shoes. What's stopping you?"
- "I need you to start moving toward the door now."
- "This is the last time I'm going to ask, and then I'm going to help you do it."

Common Mistakes:

- Talking too much. Every additional word reduces impact. Keep it simple.
- Asking instead of telling. Save questions for actual choices.
- Repeating without consequence. If you've asked three times, you're training them to wait for the fourth.
- Yelling from a distance. It doesn't work and it escalates everyone.

The Pattern That Works:

1. Get close and connected
2. Give one clear instruction
3. Wait
4. If no response, give one reminder with a stated consequence
5. If still no response, follow through

This might sound slow, but it's actually faster than repeating yourself ten times and then exploding.

Key Takeaway:

Kids don't listen when there are too many barriers between your words and their action. Remove the barriers: get their attention, reduce overload, offer some autonomy, and make follow-through reliable. You'll repeat yourself less, and they'll comply more—with less friction for everyone.

Next lesson: handling backtalk, lying, and pushback without losing your mind.
