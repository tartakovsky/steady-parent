# How to Discipline Your Child: 6 Ways That Work

Source: Good Inside (Dr. Becky Kennedy, Clinical Psychologist)

## Core Paradigm Shift: Teaching vs. Punishing

**Effective discipline is not about punishing kids to correct "bad" behavior.** It is about teaching kids the skills they need to improve behavior in the first place. This reframe transforms the entire approach to discipline.

### The Fundamental Insight About Children

Kids are born with all of the feelings and none of the skills to manage those feelings. When a child yells, hits, or misbehaves, they are actually showing us that they lack the skills needed to manage how they are feeling in the moment. The parent's job is to teach the missing skills, not punish children for lacking them.

### What This Approach Is NOT

Approaching discipline from a place of teaching does not mean letting your kid "get away" with harmful or inappropriate behavior. It means embodying your authority as a **sturdy leader** and building your child's emotional regulation skills to change behavior in the long term.

### Long-Term Outcomes

When you approach discipline through teaching, you reduce hitting and screaming while simultaneously wiring your child with critical lifelong skills: empathy, resilience, self-awareness, and more. These are the skills that will help them speak respectfully to their boss, navigate conflict with friends, and communicate their needs to a partner as an adult.

## Strategy 1: Give Consequences a Second Thought

### The False Choice Parents Face

Parents typically turn to punishment because they want kids to learn that there are consequences in the "real world." The reasoning goes: if your child yells at their boss in their first job, they could lose their job. They need to know that.

### The Better Alternative

There are two paths: You can teach your kids that there are consequences to yelling, OR you can teach them how to manage their frustration so they will not get to the point of yelling at their boss in the first place. The latter is preferable.

### The Replacement Question

Next time your child hits, kicks, or misbehaves, recognize the urge to give a consequence and instead ask yourself: **"What skill is my child missing right now? What is happening underneath this behavior?"**

### The Key Reframe

Our kids' struggles on the outside mean they are struggling on the inside. Their struggles are cries for support, not punishment or shame.

## Strategy 2: Set Boundaries

### The Formula: Boundary Plus Connection

When our kids act out, we have to be the boundary for our child that they cannot yet be for themselves. When we follow boundaries with connection, we reflect the best version of our kids back to them.

### Example 1: Throwing Blocks

**Instead of:** "Stop throwing blocks or you're going to your room!"

**Try this:**
- **Set boundary:** "I won't let you throw. I'm going to put the blocks away until you can calm your body."
- **Connect:** "You're a good kid having a hard time."

### Example 2: Clearing Plates

**Instead of:** "If you don't clear your plate, no iPad tonight!"

**Try this:**
- **Set boundary:** "I know clearing your plate is no fun, and in this family, everyone clears their own plates."
- **Connect:** "I know you're a responsible kid who can do it."

## Strategy 3: Redirect Problem Behaviors

### The Purpose of Redirection

Once you have set a boundary, redirect your child to safer, healthier ways of expressing their emotions. Redirecting teaches your child to listen to their feelings and find healthier outlets for expressing them.

### Example: Hitting a Sibling

"You're allowed to be angry, and sometimes this anger needs to come out in hits. Like I said, I won't let you hit your brother or other people, but you can hit this pillow. Let me know when you get all of your hits out. I'll be right here until your body feels calm."

### Key Elements of This Script

The parent validates the emotion (anger is allowed), acknowledges the physical impulse (anger sometimes needs to come out in hits), holds the boundary (not hitting people), offers an alternative outlet (the pillow), invites the child to communicate when done, and provides reassuring presence throughout.

## Strategy 4: Spend One-on-One Time With Your Kid

### Why Quality Time Matters for Discipline

While it may seem simple, spending quality time with your child outside of tough moments has a huge impact on increased cooperation and reduced rudeness, whining, and other difficult behaviors over time.

### The Connection Capital Metaphor

Connection is the "currency" of parent-child relationships.

**You gain connection capital:**
- Every time you validate emotions
- Every time you make time to be present

**You spend connection capital:**
- Every time you make decisions your kids dislike
- Every time you ask them to do something they do not want to do

**The strategic implication:** You have to build up connection capital outside of tough moments so you can spend it later inside of tough moments.

### Special Time as a Practice

**Special Time** is a set amount of one-on-one time with your child without distractions or devices, where they get to decide what you do together.

## Strategy 5: Show Them the Way (Modeling)

### The Power of Modeling

You can proactively help your child learn how to manage big feelings like anger, frustration, and disappointment by demonstrating realistic regulation yourself.

### What Modeling Communicates

When we model coping skills, we essentially "say" to our kids that parents also need to practice managing tough feelings and tricky moments. When we model, we leave our kids feeling less alone in their difficulties.

### Example 1: Struggling to Open a Jar While Cooking

"Ugh!!! This lid is so tight!! I can't do it!" Then pause and say, "Ok deep breath... go slowly... I got this."

### Example 2: Resisting Losing a Board Game

"No, no, no... I think I actually won, it's just that you... Ah! I want to throw all my cards! Wait... I'm good inside... I'm good inside even when I lose... Okay. Good game, sweetie."

### Bonus Effect

In witnessing you struggle, your kids might even offer you their own calm-down ideas, which helps remind them of their own regulation toolbox.

## Strategy 6: Highlight Skills Underneath Good Behavior

### The Core Principle

If we want to get the best out of our kids, we need to see the best in them. That is why it is so powerful to highlight our kids' healthy regulation skills in between tough moments.

### How to Spot Opportunities

Pay attention to "good behavior." Maybe it is your child taking a deep breath while doing homework or calmly asking for a toy back from their sibling.

### The Critical Distinction

Instead of praising the behavior itself, recognize the skills underneath the behavior.

### Example Scripts

**Situation:** Child persisted through difficulty.
**Script:** "Wow, even when things got hard, you didn't give up. That's something I really admire about you."

**Situation:** Child asked calmly for toy back from sibling.
**Script:** "I noticed how calmly you asked for your toy back from your sister. You were angry, and you found a different way to tell her. You're really learning to pay attention to your big feelings!"

### The Internal Message This Creates

By shifting attention away from behavior and toward skills, we teach our child confidence and a self-belief that says: "Even when things feel hard on the outside, I am good inside."

## Why Avoiding Harsh Discipline Is Essential

### The Practical Long-Term Argument

At some point, your child will grow up and it will become impossible to actually enforce punishments or consequences. If you want them to cooperate with requests, come to you with questions, and spend time with you later, you need to start building the foundations of a safe and loving relationship now.

### The Relationship as the Primary Tool

The most powerful parenting tool we have is our relationship with our kids.

### Contrasting Approaches

**Fear-based parenting strategies** (withholding dessert, spanking) strain the relationship by making kids feel alone and ashamed. Research shows this can negatively impact children's mental health and development.

**Connection-based strategies** (like Special Time) strengthen the relationship by helping kids feel seen and supported.

## Addressing Parent Guilt

### The Reassurance

If you are feeling guilty about past parenting moments: You are a good parent who was doing your best with the resources you had at the moment. You did not mess up your child, and it is never too late to show up as the parent you want to be.

## The Punishment Cycle (Anti-Pattern)

### What the Cycle Looks Like

Parents threaten consequences (time-out, no screen time, dinner without dessert). The next week, kids are back to screaming "I hate you!", throwing blocks, and hitting siblings. Parents return to making threats. This cycle does not feel good to parents or kids, and it fails to produce lasting change.

### Why It Fails

The punishment cycle addresses behavior without addressing the underlying skill deficit. Children continue to struggle because they still lack the emotional regulation skills they need.

## Summary of Inside vs. Outside the Moment Strategies
