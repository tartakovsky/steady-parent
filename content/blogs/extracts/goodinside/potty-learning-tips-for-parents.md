# Potty Learning: A Body Awareness Approach

**Source:** Good Inside (Dr. Becky Kennedy, Clinical Psychologist)

## Core Philosophy: Reframing from Training to Learning

The terminology shift from "potty training" to "potty learning" reflects a fundamental difference in approach. The word "training" implies shaping behavior through external control, which leads parents down counterproductive paths: punishing accidents, forcing scheduled toilet sits, and spiraling when outcomes deviate from expectations.

**The deeper purpose of the potty process is not about peeing and pooping on the potty.** It is about the child feeling independent, in control, and aware of their own body. This reframe connects toilet learning to broader developmental foundations.

Potty learning represents one of the first times a toddler learns whether they are in charge of their own body. The process of understanding internal feelings and sensations is the same foundational process that builds confidence, informs healthy boundaries, and shapes many other important life skills.

## Readiness Assessment

### False Indicators (Common Myths to Reject)

These are NOT valid signs that a child is ready:

- Other children in your child's peer group are being potty trained
- A relative or friend claims your child is ready
- Your own anxiety or fears about the process
- The age you were when potty trained
- The age your other children were when potty trained

The emphasis is on ignoring external pressure and social comparison entirely.

### True Readiness Signals

Look for these indicators in your individual child:

- **Instruction following:** Ability to follow simple instructions
- **Bladder control duration:** Tendency to stay dry for at least two hours
- **Nap dryness:** Tendency to be dry after naps
- **Bowel predictability:** Regular and predictable bowel movements
- **Curiosity:** Interest in bathroom activities
- **Discomfort awareness:** Discomfort with dirty diapers
- **Language comprehension:** Ability to understand bathroom words and relevant body part words
- **Independence drive:** Desire for more independence (may manifest as resisting help or trying to do things independently)
- **Communication capacity:** Ability to communicate wants and needs (verbal or non-verbal)

**Key principle: Do not rush.** Waiting for true readiness ensures a smoother transition and protects the developmental learning embedded in the process.

## Parent Self-Preparation

Before beginning, parents must reflect on their own emotional patterns. Anticipating feelings that might arise during toilet learning improves the parent's ability to cope, enabling them to show up as a "sturdier" presence for the child.

### Self-Reflection Questions

- What happens when I am invested in something that feels out of my control?
- How do I react to making mistakes and tolerating frustration?
- What happens when my house gets dirty or messy?
- How comfortable am I allowing my kids to separate from me?

### The Outcome vs. Process Distinction

This separation is described as "critical":

**Outcome:** The child using the potty.

**Process:** The child noticing signs in their body, having accidents, feeling independent, and building confidence in themselves.

**Prioritizing the process is what leads to successful outcomes now and later**, especially when the child is outside the home without prompts or the desire to please the parent. This suggests that process-focused learning creates internalized body awareness rather than external compliance.

## Pre-Launch Preparation (Months Before)

These strategies are described as "low-effort, high-impact" and should be implemented in the months before officially starting.

### Build Bathroom Associations

Change dirty diapers in the bathroom rather than elsewhere. Ideally have the child stand during changes so they feel more independent. Dump poop from the diaper into the toilet. This creates the mental connection between elimination and the bathroom space.

### Model the Internal Cue Recognition

The goal is teaching that a specific bodily feeling serves as the cue to use the toilet. Parents should narrate their own experience aloud: "Oh, I have that feeling... Yup, my bladder is telling me it's full! I'm going to the bathroom, and then I'll be right back."

This models both the recognition of the internal sensation and the appropriate response to it.

### Empower Through Choice

Let the child pick out their own underwear so they feel like an active participant. Introduce the potty without pressure by placing it in the bathroom and allowing the child to explore it freely.

## The Three-Day Intensive Process

### Structure and Setup

Set aside three consecutive days for the beginning of potty learning. Stay at home during these days so the child can focus on building new skills. A long weekend provides ideal timing.

With the right approach, children can learn to use the potty in just three days.

### Technique 1: Prepare the Physical Environment

Place several potties around the house for easy access. Stock up on the child's favorite drinks or make popsicles to increase liquid consumption (more liquid means more practice opportunities).

**Accident preparation is essential.** Accidents are framed as "a normal part of the potty learning process." To reduce parental stress:

- Roll up rugs
- Cover furniture with old blankets
- Keep cleaner and paper towels in common areas
- Keep a stack of extra underwear or change of clothes nearby

### Technique 2: Explain the Change

When the toddler wakes on day one, explain what is happening with enthusiasm: "It's an exciting day! We're going to start using the potty. I know you can figure this out! We're going to take off your diaper. What undies do you want to wear?"

This script combines announcement, confidence expression, action description, and empowering choice.

### Technique 3: Focus on Bodily Autonomy

During the process, emphasize that the child owns responsibility for their body awareness. The suggested language: "Your job is to pay attention to your body and let me know when you have that 'I have to go!' feeling. We will run to find a potty when you have it and get as much of the pee or poop in there as you can!"

This framing assigns the child ownership ("your job"), emphasizes internal attention ("pay attention to your body"), creates partnership ("let me know"), and sets achievable expectations ("as much... as you can" rather than perfection).

## Signs a Child Is NOT Ready

A child may not be ready if they exhibit:

- Lack of interest in the potty
- Struggle with following simple instructions
- Rarely have a dry diaper for longer than two hours

The recommendation is to wait until the individual child shows readiness signs to ensure a smoother transition.

## Key Takeaways (Summary)

1. **Purpose reframe:** The potty process is about the child feeling independent, in control, and aware of their own body, not merely about elimination in the correct location.

2. **Individual timing:** Every child is different. Parents will recognize the right time for their specific child.

3. **Empowerment strategies:** Let children pick out underwear, get comfortable with the toilet, and communicate when they have "that feeling."

## Unaddressed Topics (Acknowledged Gaps)

The article acknowledges but does not cover:

- How to respond when a child refuses to use the potty
- How to handle accidents
- Poop anxiety in children

These represent common "what about when..." parenting concerns that require additional guidance.
