# How to Help Your Child Manage Their Anxiety

## Core Framework: The Good Inside Anxiety Equation

**Anxiety = Uncertainty + Underestimation of Ability to Cope**

This equation reveals why common parental responses backfire. Most parents attempt to "solve" anxiety by reducing uncertainty and reassuring children that "everything will be okay." Ironically, this approach increases anxiety rather than reducing it.

The effective intervention targets the second variable: helping kids tap into their capability and coping ability. When children feel capable of handling uncertainty, anxiety decreases even when the uncertainty remains.

## What Anxiety Actually Is

Anxiety is a feeling of worry or fear that manifests through four channels:
1. Sensations (bodily feelings)
2. Emotions
3. Thoughts
4. Physical symptoms

Anxiety feels uneasy in the body. The core issue underlying all anxiety symptoms remains constant: the child is uncomfortable and fearful.

### Behavioral Manifestations in Children

Anxiety can present in two seemingly opposite ways:

**Internalizing presentations:**
- Hesitation
- Shyness
- Clinginess
- Tearfulness
- Protest during separation

**Externalizing presentations:**
- Out of control behavior
- Tantrums
- Avoidance
- Fears

The same underlying discomfort drives both types of presentation. Signs of anxiety differ from child to child and situation to situation, but the core emotional experience is identical.

## Critical Reframe for Parents

Anxious moments are common in childhood and do not predict an anxious future. When a child shows signs of anxiety, this does not mean the child will be anxious forever. Anxiety in kids can feel concerning, but it is normal for kids to experience anxious behavior on occasion.

Understanding anxiety is the prerequisite for effective intervention. Only once we understand can we effectively intervene.

## Strategy 1: Validate and Empathize with Feelings

### The Counterintuitive Truth

The best response when a child is anxious is to let them know it is okay to be feeling anxious.

### Why Reassurance Backfires

When parents tell a child all the reasons why "everything will be ok," two harmful effects occur:

1. The child feels more alone in their anxiety and more confused about their feelings. This isolation and confusion increases discomfort and anxiety rather than reducing it.

2. The child perceives that the parent is just as afraid of their discomfort as they are. When children sense parental fear of their feelings, their own fear increases.

The underlying message of reassurance is: "Your feelings are so scary that we need to make them go away quickly." This amplifies rather than diminishes the threat.

## Strategy 2: Role Play Anxiety Provoking Situations

### How Role Play Builds Tolerance

Role play allows a child to practice tolerating anxiety in advance. This advance practice increases the likelihood that they will be able to tolerate anxiety when a real life tricky moment comes.

### The Approach vs. Avoidance Dynamic

Role playing or "doing practice runs" helps a child approach the situation that brings anxiety. Approaching anxiety producing situations brings feelings of capability.

The alternative, avoiding these situations, brings feelings of additional fear. Avoidance reinforces the message that the situation is too dangerous to face, which strengthens anxiety.

### Parental Involvement During Role Play

Role play gives parents an active role in supporting a child through each step of an anxiety producing situation. The parent becomes a collaborative partner rather than a bystander.

**Example application:** If a child is anxious about attending a birthday party, set up a pretend birthday party with chairs or stuffed animals. Practice going through different scenarios together.

### Understanding What Drives the Anxiety

Role play helps parents understand what is making their child feel anxious. The specific fears often reveal themselves during practice, allowing for targeted support.

### The Emotional Vaccination Concept

**Emotional Vaccination** is the process of connecting with a child before a big feeling moment so that the child feels more prepared for that moment when it comes.

Role play enables emotional vaccination by creating preparation. Preparation helps kids feel more ready to confront situations that make them anxious. During role play, child and parent practice coping skills together, which compounds the preparation benefit.

## Strategy 3: Practice Deep Breathing Together

### The Physiology of Anxious Breathing

During moments of anxiety, breathing becomes more rapid and more shallow. This breathing pattern increases anxiety, creating a feedback loop.

### Why Deep Breathing Works

Deep breathing slows the body down and helps kids and adults feel more grounded again. It interrupts the physiological escalation that anxiety produces.

### Making Deep Breathing Concrete for Children

"Deep breathing" is sometimes hard for children to concretely understand.

**Hot Cocoa Breathing technique:**
1. Tell the child to imagine they are breathing in the smell of hot cocoa
2. Then breathe out through their mouth very slowly
3. The goal: breathe slowly enough not to blow off the imaginary marshmallows on top of the hot cocoa

Children love this visual because it transforms an abstract instruction into a concrete, playful image.

### Practice Together, Not Teaching

Practicing Hot Cocoa Breathing together, as opposed to "teaching" a child how to do it, helps the child feel less alone and more motivated to try it. The distinction between practicing together and teaching matters because it maintains connection rather than creating a teacher student hierarchy.

## Strategy 4: Spend Quality Time Connecting and Communicating

### The Connection Anxiety Link

Anxiety gets worse when kids feel alone. Anxiety gets better when kids feel understood.

When a child is anxious, spending time with them and letting them know they can talk to you about their anxiety helps. Communication is essential for establishing connection with an anxious child.

### Connection Builds Resilience

The more connected your child feels, the more resilience they will have to manage anxious feelings. Connection is not merely comforting; it is functional in building coping capacity.

### The "I Know I Don't Know" Strategy

This strategy helps a child feel safer and more secure when discussing anxiety.

**How to implement:**
1. Name what you know
2. Name what you do not know
3. Quantifying both helps the child calm down

**Example script:** "Here's what I know and here's what I don't know: I know your teacher will be waiting for you and I know there will be many new kids in your class. I don't know exactly how long I will stay before I say goodbye. I also know you can handle this and we'll get through it together."

The strategy works because it models honest acknowledgment of uncertainty while pairing it with confidence in the child's capability.

### The "Telling the Story" Strategy

With Telling the Story, you walk through how a situation went, what happened next, and how your child was able to cope.

**Example script:** "I took you to school, you were a little nervous to say goodbye, I knew you'd be safe, you played with friends, and I came back just like I said I would!"

**Multiple benefits of Telling the Story:**
1. Helps parents connect with their child
2. Shows the child that they are resilient through anxious moments
3. Strengthens the parent child connection
4. Teaches the child they can rely on a parent to learn how to regulate their emotions

The narrative structure helps children integrate the experience and recognize their own capability in retrospect.

## Strategy 5: Model Healthy Anxiety Management

### Why Modeling Matters

Children are always watching their parents. When children observe that parents have anxiety and that parents can cope with it, this shows them they too will be able to be resilient in tough moments.

### Parental Anxiety is Not a Problem

It is okay if you feel anxious. Parental anxiety is not inherently harmful to children.

### What to Do When Anxious in Front of Your Child

Three essential steps:
1. **Label your feeling as your own:** Make clear the anxiety belongs to you, not the child
2. **Tell your kid it is not their fault:** Children often assume responsibility for parental emotions
3. **Commit to building your own regulation skills:** This enables you to show up as a sturdy leader who can help your child co regulate in tough moments

### The Role of Co Regulation

**Co regulation** is essential to developing emotional regulation skills that enable a child to manage their worries and anxiety effectively. Children learn to regulate by being regulated with a calm, capable adult, not by being taught regulation techniques in isolation.

A "sturdy leader" is a parent who can remain grounded while helping a child navigate difficult emotions. This steadiness provides the scaffolding children need to develop their own regulation capacity.

## The Developmental Perspective

Anxiety is a common part of child development. It makes sense that a child would feel worried as they learn about the world and try new things. Similarly, it makes sense that parents feel anxious at times.

The goal is not to eliminate anxiety but to help children tolerate and build skills to manage it. This approach sets the stage for resilience and capability rather than avoidance and fragility.

## Why Parents Struggle with This

Most parents do not know how to manage their kid's anxiety or build a child's confidence simply because these things are not "natural" to know. Unlike other jobs, parenting does not come with training or a manual. This lack of preparation explains why parents feel overwhelmed.

### The Path Forward

By learning a step by step game plan to manage anxiety and increase confidence, parents start to feel confident and hopeful, and more connected to their kid. The transformation happens on both sides: as parents gain competence, children gain capability.
