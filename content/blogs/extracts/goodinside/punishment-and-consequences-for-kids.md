# An Effective Alternative to Punishments for Kids

Source: Good Inside (Dr. Becky Kennedy, Clinical Psychologist)

## Core Philosophy: Understand Before Intervening

The foundational principle is that most discipline approaches fail because they skip a critical first step: understanding why the behavior is happening in the first place. Parents must get curious before dispensing consequences.

**The biological reality**: Children are born with all of the feelings but none of the skills to manage those feelings. When a child yells, hits, or lies, they have not considered the situation, assessed all options, and chosen to misbehave. Instead, they experienced a big feeling or sensation they could not regulate, and it exploded out of their bodies as behavior.

**The key reframe**: "Bad" behavior is a sign of dysregulation, not disobedience. This principle applies equally to adults. Behavior improves when children develop stronger core emotional regulation skills.


## Why Punishments and Consequences Fail

### The Swimming Pool Analogy

Consider how we approach a child who lacks a physical skill like swimming. No parent would stand by the pool watching their child struggle and threaten: "You have to swim! If you don't start swimming, no dessert for a week!" or "That's not swimming! Time-out NOW. You need to think about what you've done wrong."

The analogy reveals the absurdity of our typical approach to emotional skills. Whether the missing skill is swimming or regulating emotions, a parent's job is to teach the skills children are missing, not punish them for not knowing yet.

### Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Costs

Even when punishments produce short-term behavior change, they come at a long-term cost. These discipline approaches can leave children feeling ashamed, afraid, and alone. The internal narrative becomes: "I'm a bad kid who did a bad thing."

**Two problematic outcomes emerge over time**:
1. **Internalization**: Children develop anxiety or self-criticism
2. **Externalization**: Children act out in more dangerous ways such as lying or sneaking out as they get older


## The Teaching Approach: Not Permissiveness

A critical clarification: approaching discipline from a place of teaching rather than punishing does not mean letting children "get away" with harmful or inappropriate behavior. The teaching approach means embodying authority as a sturdy leader while building the child's emotional regulation skills for the long-term.


## The Two-Step Intervention Strategy

This strategy is specifically designed for inside difficult moments, the exact times when parents typically resort to punishments.

### Understanding What Acting Out Communicates

When a child acts out, they are essentially communicating: "This feeling inside me, it's too much for me to handle! Please tell me that it's not too much for you. If my feelings don't scare you, then over time they won't scare me... and I'll learn to regulate them myself."

Children are begging parents to demonstrate that the parent is not afraid of the child's feelings, that the parent can keep them safe.

### Step 1: Establish Safety

Safety is established through firm boundaries. This takes two forms depending on the situation:

**Verbal boundary**: Simply stating the boundary when words suffice

**Physical boundary**: Physically stepping in to be the boundary when the situation requires it

### Step 2: Validate Goodness

After establishing safety, validate the child's goodness. The purpose is to separate the behavior on the outside from who you see on the inside. Children feel good inside when parents stay with them when they are upset. This shows children that their feelings do not scare the parent or make the parent see them as bad kids.

**The developmental outcome**: Over time, children start to learn to do this separation themselves. The combination of safety plus goodness leads to emotional regulation over time.


## Practical Example: Child Throws a Block at a Friend

**Anti-pattern** (what not to say): "No iPad tonight if you don't stop throwing."

**The teaching approach**:

**Step 1, Establish safety**: State your boundary by saying "I won't let you throw." If physical intervention is needed, say "I'm going to pick you up until your body calms down."

**Step 2, Validate goodness**: "I know you're a good kid having a hard time."


## Three Key Takeaways

1. **Kids act out of control because they feel out of control.** The external behavior reflects the internal state.

2. **Punishments and consequences might stop behavior in the short-term, but they do not teach kids the skills they need to manage big feelings.** Those skills are the key to lasting, meaningful change.

3. **During a tough moment, set boundaries and validate your child's goodness to build emotional regulation.** This two-step process directly addresses the skill deficit.


## Common Anti-Patterns in Traditional Discipline

**Time-out**: Isolates the child during emotional dysregulation when they most need connection and skill-building

**Removing screen time**: Uses external control rather than building internal regulation capacity

**Withholding dessert**: Creates transactional compliance rather than genuine skill development

**Threats**: "If you don't stop, then..." triggers fear rather than teaching regulation

**Shame-based correction**: "You need to think about what you've done wrong" creates the internal narrative of being a bad kid


## The Cycle of Ineffective Discipline

Parents often find themselves stuck in a repeating pattern: implement consequence, see behavior stop temporarily, behavior returns (child screaming "I hate you!", throwing objects, sneaking phone into room), return to making threats.

This cycle persists because the underlying approach addresses behavior without building the skills that would prevent future dysregulation.


## Breaking Generational Patterns

Many parents default to the discipline methods they experienced growing up, then question why these methods are not working. The invitation is to break these cycles by learning approaches that do not rely on fear, guilt, or shame.


## Remaining Questions for Further Exploration

The article acknowledges several scenarios that require additional guidance:
- What to do when a child keeps repeating the same "bad" behavior
- How to identify which specific skills a child needs to develop
- How to transition if a parent has been using punishments up until now
