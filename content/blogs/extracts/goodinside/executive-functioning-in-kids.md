# Executive Functioning in Kids: Why They Struggle and How to Help

Source: Good Inside (Dr. Becky Kennedy, Clinical Psychologist; Dr. Alex Reed, Clinical Psychologist specializing in neurodevelopment)

## Core Reframe: Identity vs. Skill Gap

The central teaching point is that children displaying executive dysfunction are not lazy, careless, or bad. These are **skill gaps**, not **character flaws**. Parents often wonder "Why are they so lazy?" or "What am I doing wrong?" but the accurate frame is: a good kid having a hard time with executive functioning. Both child and parent deserve support rather than blame.

## What Executive Functioning Actually Is

Executive functioning refers to a set of **cognitive skills** that help us plan, respond, and regulate. The metaphor used is the brain's **"control panel"**, an essential system that manages impulses and emotions in daily life.

### The Eight Core Executive Function Skills

1. **Flexible thinking**: The capacity to adapt when things do not go according to plan
2. **Working memory**: The ability to mentally hold and use information while working with it
3. **Self-monitoring**: The skill of evaluating one's own behavior and adjusting accordingly
4. **Planning and organizing**: The capacity to define steps toward a goal while keeping track of resources and responsibilities throughout the process
5. **Task initiation**: The ability to get started, especially when the task is boring or complex
6. **Inhibition**: The skill of pausing to think before acting or reacting
7. **Emotional regulation**: The ability to recognize, manage, and express big feelings appropriately
8. **Focus**: The capacity to prioritize and sustain attention on what matters

## How Executive Dysfunction Manifests

Executive dysfunction appears in small, everyday moments that feel endlessly frustrating to parents. Observable signs include:

- Going from 0 to 60 emotionally when plans change (such as soccer practice being cancelled)
- Leaving a trail of belongings wherever they go
- Struggling to wait their turn in games
- Being told to put on shoes, only to be found 10 minutes later still barefoot
- Putting off homework until the last minute, then begging for help
- Having a messy backpack
- Needing constant reminders to get ready
- Difficulty starting homework

## The Three Reasons Kids Struggle with Executive Functioning

The foundational principle stated is: **understand before you intervene effectively**.

### Reason 1: Executive Function Skills Develop Slowly

Children are not born with these skills. They develop incrementally over time. The **prefrontal cortex**, the brain region responsible for executive function, does not fully develop until the mid-20s.

**Developmental Expectations by Stage**

**Preschoolers** are just starting out. They can follow simple, single-step directions like "Grab your shoes!" but multi-step processes and small changes in routine are difficult for them. Major meltdowns are normal and even healthy at this stage.

**Elementary-age children** are ready for more responsibility, such as remembering their backpack or setting the table. However, they still need reminders and supervision. Common struggles at this age include blurting out answers, interrupting others, and losing track of items.

**Tweens and teens** display exciting bursts of independence, including managing homework independently, keeping up with schedules, and making social plans. Their skills are still developing, which means risk-taking behavior and roller-coaster emotions are par for the course.

**Key Insight**: Two things can be true simultaneously: a child's executive function challenges are frustrating AND they might also be age-appropriate.

### Reason 2: These Skills Must Be Taught

Executive function skills do not develop in a vacuum. Flexible thinking, inhibition, and emotional regulation need to be **actively taught**, just as we teach children how to read or swim.

**Neurodivergent children** especially need more support in building these skills than others because of differences in their brain structure, function, and development.

**Key Insight**: A child's executive function issues are not a sign of who they are as a person. They are a sign of where they need support.

### Reason 3: The Digital Age Makes Learning Harder

Children today grow up surrounded by:
- Constant stimulation
- Instant answers
- Endless scrolling
- Screens that deliver fast, easy "dopamine hits"

Growing research indicates that all of this negatively impacts executive function development. Children are getting **less practice** at:
- Waiting
- Tolerating frustration
- Pushing through boring or difficult tasks

This does not mean children are doomed. It does mean parents and society must be **intentional** about helping children develop these critical skills.

**Key Insight**: In a fast-and-easy digital world, kids need more support strengthening their executive function skills.

## Why Traditional Approaches Fail

Many parents have tried:
- Time-outs
- Grounding
- Sticker charts
- Praise

These approaches often fail because children keep engaging in the same frustrating behaviors. The insight offered is that punishments and rewards are not the only option, and there is a more effective way.

## The Good Inside Approach: Three Guiding Principles

Before addressing specific skills like focus or emotional regulation, parents need **guiding principles**: big-picture, reliable strategies that can be used and returned to no matter what skill the child is building.

### Principle 1: Connect, Don't Criticize

When children feel criticized, they shut down. When they feel connected, they can learn and grow. Connection starts by **validating the struggle** underneath the difficult behavior.

**Anti-pattern (criticism)**: "You still haven't started? What have you been doing all afternoon?"

**Effective approach (connection)**: "You're a good kid having a hard time getting started."

### Principle 2: Adopt a Same-Team Mindset

There are two ways to approach executive dysfunction:
1. You versus your kid
2. You and your kid versus the problem

The second framing puts parent and child on the same team, creating a more supportive and collaborative environment for solving challenges.

**Anti-pattern (adversarial)**: "This is your last reminder. If you don't start your homework now, no TV for the rest of the week."

**Effective approach (same-team)**: "Let's figure this out together. What's the easiest first step you can take?"

### Principle 3: Start Small, Start Strong

Parents often feel tempted to fix everything at once. However, the most meaningful change starts small. The recommendation is to focus on **one or two key areas**, such as teaching planning skills or managing impulsivity. Quick wins build confidence and make it easier for both child and parent to keep going.

**Anti-pattern (overwhelming)**: "You need to get your act together and stay on top of everything."

**Effective approach (incremental)**: "This week, let's just practice one thing: Setting a three-minute timer to get started."

## Understanding Big Reactions (Meltdowns)

Big reactions often stem from struggles with emotional regulation, one of the key executive function skills. When a child's "control center" is still developing, changes in plans or frustrating tasks can feel overwhelming. Supporting this skill helps children learn to pause, manage big feelings, and build resilience over time.

## When to Seek Additional Support

Many executive function challenges are age-appropriate since these skills develop slowly into adulthood. However, if a child's struggles feel:
- Frequent
- Intense
- Impacting daily life

It may be time to seek additional professional support for building executive function skills.

## Summary of Three Key Takeaways

1. **Your kid is not lazy, careless, or bad.** Executive function issues are skills gaps, not character flaws.

2. **Kids struggle with executive functioning for different reasons.** Development, brain wiring, and today's digital world all play a role.

3. **Your job is to help your kid build the executive function skills they are missing**, not punish them for not knowing yet.

## Practical Support Strategies Mentioned

- Teaching planning skills step by step
- Practicing emotional regulation strategies
- Building routines that reduce overwhelm
- Using connection and teamwork ("we're in this together") so kids feel safe enough to practice and grow
- Using a timer (like a three-minute timer) to help with task initiation
- Identifying the easiest first step to break paralysis
