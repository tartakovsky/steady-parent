# Managing School Refusal in Children and Teens

Source: Good Inside (Dr. Becky Kennedy, Clinical Psychologist)

## Core Reframe: Understanding School Refusal

**School refusal** (also called school phobia or school avoidance) is more than "not liking school." It involves persistent fear or anxiety about going to school. This distinction matters because it shifts the intervention approach entirely.

### The Interpretive Trap

Parents commonly interpret school refusal as laziness ("Why is my kid so lazy!") or defiance ("My kid never listens to me!"). These interpretations automatically place parent and child on opposite teams by defining the child as the problem.

**Foundational principle**: We have to understand before we intervene. This includes understanding school reluctance rather than reacting to surface behaviors.

### The Good Inside Reframe

Your child's refusal to go to school is not a sign that they are a bad kid. It is a sign that they are a good kid having a hard time.

When you adopt this view, your child's struggles become signals showing where they need your help, not indicators of who they are as a person. This reframe moves you from opposition to alliance: you and your child now stand on the same team against the problem rather than against each other.

## Four Common Underlying Causes

Children or teens experiencing school refusal may be struggling with one or more of the following:

1. **Separation anxiety**: Difficulty tolerating physical separation from parents or caregivers
2. **Social and peer dynamics**: Challenges navigating friendships, social hierarchies, or bullying
3. **Executive functioning**: Struggles with organization, task initiation, time management, or academic demands
4. **Mental health**: Underlying anxiety, depression, or other conditions affecting capacity to engage

## The Parent's Emotional Landscape

Parents legitimately feel stuck between two extremes:

1. **Forcing compliance**: Ignoring the child's distress and making them go anyway, which feels awful for both parties
2. **Allowing avoidance**: Letting them stay home, which can lead to academic consequences and behavioral patterns that entrench over time

Both feelings matter. The approach outlined below offers a third path that transforms short-term behavior while strengthening the long-term relationship.

## Five Strategies for Managing School Refusal

### Strategy 1: Be a Sturdy Leader

The first step to supporting your child is supporting yourself. When children are dysregulated and anxious, they need a parent who is regulated, calm, and confident.

**The airplane analogy**: Imagine intense turbulence on a plane. Passengers are panicking. You have two pilots to choose from:

- **Pilot A** (reactive): "AH! Stop screaming! You're scaring me!" This pilot absorbs and amplifies the passengers' fear.
- **Pilot B** (sturdy): "I know this is scary, and I know we can fly through this." This pilot validates the fear while maintaining control.

Children need Pilot B. A **sturdy leader** is someone who can see and validate a child's feelings without letting those feelings overwhelm them or change their decisions.

**Critical insight**: You can care about your child's resistance to school. You can acknowledge their fears, anxieties, and feelings. AND you can still decide that they are going to school. These are not contradictory.

**Self-talk script**: "My child's struggles are not a barometer of my parenting. I am a good parent with a good kid having a hard time."

### Strategy 2: Connect to Your Kid

A strong relationship with your child is your most important parenting tool when addressing school refusal or any other struggle.

**Actionable approach**: Work on establishing trust and connection outside of difficult moments. This means engaging in low-pressure shared activities: play video games together, take a walk, eat ice cream, whatever works for your family.

**Persistence matters**: If connection feels hard to build, keep trying. Your efforts matter even when results are not immediately visible.

### Strategy 3: Identify Triggers

Getting on the same team means defining the problem together. This requires curiosity about your child's specific experience.

**Exploratory conversation example**: "Hmm, I wonder... What does the lunch room feel like? I remember my cafeteria... Oh boy, was it loud at times! Hmm, what about recess? What's that like? Oh, it's not fun? I wonder why... I know it can feel hard to figure out which crowd to hang with at times... I felt that way at school when I was your age, too."

**The crucial distinction**: Your goal is not to remove triggers. Your goal is to help your child build the skills they need to cope with school-related stress and anxiety. This difference is massive in helping your child move from a state of avoidance and anxiety to a state of resilience and capability.

**Next step**: Brainstorm together what your child can do if those triggers come up. Co-creating coping strategies builds ownership and skill.

### Strategy 4: Validate

Acknowledge and validate your child's emotions and experiences while holding hope that this will get better with time.

**Validation language examples**:
- "I believe you... and I know this won't be forever."
- "Something about school feels terrible to you right now."
- "I know this is hard and I know we're going to get through this together."

**The paradox of allowing feelings**: The more you allow their feelings to exist, the less overpowering they become. When we show our kids that we are not afraid of their school-related concerns, they actually start to become less afraid too.

### Strategy 5: Hold Boundaries and Start Small

Validating feelings does not mean letting children "get away with" school refusal. It means acknowledging that this feels hard for them while holding hope that they can do hard things.

**Boundary-holding language examples**:
- "I know going to school feels hard right now, and I know you can do hard things. We are going to leave for school now."
- "I believe that you don't want to go to school. And we are still going to school today."
- "You can be upset with me for taking you to school. You're allowed to be upset. Part of my job is to make decisions that I think are best for you, even when you disagree with me."

**Graduated exposure approach**: Depending on your child and the intensity of their refusal, you may want to gradually expose them to school-related stimuli in a controlled and supportive environment. Options include:
- Taking short visits to the school
- Planning occasional half-days
- Meeting with teachers or counselors in a controlled setting

**Rationale for gradual exposure**: This helps reduce anxiety and build self-trust. Staying connected to peers and other people in school increases feelings of safety within that environment.

## Recognizing School Refusal

School refusal does not always present as loud, firm refusal. It can manifest in quieter ways:

**Loud signs**:
- Complaints of stomachaches
- Refusal to get dressed
- Tears and meltdowns in the morning

**Quiet signs**:
- Headaches
- Anxiety before bed
- A sudden drop in grades

**The diagnostic question shift**: Move from "What's wrong with my kid?" to "What's happening for my kid?" This reframe enables more effective intervention.

## The Compassion-Boundary Balance

This is the tightrope many parents walk: not wanting to push too hard, not wanting to let children opt out completely. The resolution: You can do both. You can be compassionate AND hold boundaries simultaneously.

**Example phrasing**: "I know school feels scary right now, and I am still taking you to school today."

Managing school refusal is not about snapping your fingers and fixing it. It is about being the sturdy presence your child can lean on while they build the tools to cope.

## Decision Framework: Should They Stay Home?

**Guiding question**: Will staying home help my child feel more capable next time?

- If yes, staying home may help them reset and regroup
- If no, it might be time for a small, doable step toward school with your support

Sometimes staying home helps kids reset. Other times, it makes things harder the next day by reinforcing avoidance patterns.

## When to Seek Professional Help

**Indicators for additional support**:
- School refusal is stretching into weeks
- The situation is creating constant stress in your home

**Support options**:
- School counselor
- Therapist
- Parent coach

**Reframe around seeking help**: You are not failing if you cannot figure this out alone. You are a good parent with a good kid who needs help with something big. Just as we want our kids to ask for help when they need it, parents get to do that too.

## Summary of Key Principles

1. **Understand before intervening**: School refusal signals struggle, not character defects
2. **Same team mentality**: Parent and child together against the problem
3. **Sturdy leadership**: Validate feelings without being overwhelmed by them
4. **Connection outside difficult moments**: Relationship is your primary tool
5. **Curiosity over judgment**: Identify specific triggers through exploration
6. **Validation paradox**: Allowing feelings diminishes their power
7. **Boundaries with compassion**: Both elements coexist, neither optional
8. **Skill-building over trigger removal**: Resilience and capability as the goal
9. **Graduated exposure when needed**: Small steps build self-trust
10. **Professional support is valid**: Asking for help models healthy behavior
