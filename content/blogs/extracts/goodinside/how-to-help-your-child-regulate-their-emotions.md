# How to Help Your Child Regulate Their Emotions

## Core Conceptual Framework

**Emotional regulation** is defined as the ability to cope with intense feelings. It represents an essential aspect of **self-regulation**, which encompasses managing our emotions, thoughts, and behaviors together. This capacity serves as a foundational skill for children to become confident, resilient, and caring adults.

### The Behavior-Emotion Connection

In their early years, children often experience emotions that feel too big to manage in their bodies. Because the feelings cannot be contained internally, they come catapulting out as difficult behaviors such as hitting, throwing, biting, or screaming. The causal principle at work: **when kids feel out of control, they act out of control**.

This framework explains why telling a child "Don't hit!" rarely produces the desired result. Behavior is merely the surface of a child's experience. To create long-term change, adults must help children regulate the intense feelings happening underneath the behavior. Surface-level correction addresses symptoms rather than causes.

### The Learning Mechanism

The core insight about how emotional regulation develops: **Children learn to self-soothe through the experience of being soothed by their caregivers**. This is the big idea that governs all practical approaches.

While every child's developmental timeline differs, the process of building emotional regulation remains constant. Children need adults to:

1. Stay calm
2. Validate their experience
3. Model coping skills in the face of overwhelming emotions

## Strategy 1: Manage Your Own Emotions First

Building your child's emotional regulation skills begins with building your own emotional regulation skills. Parents serve as the **sturdy leader** of the family. Your calm presence in the face of your child's emotional turbulence constitutes the most important parenting tool you possess.

### Practical Self-Regulation Technique

When you start to feel frustrated or angry, especially when your child is present, practice regulating your emotions through this sequence:

1. Pause
2. Take a deep breath
3. Say kind words to yourself

**Example self-talk**: "This feels hard because it is hard, not because I'm doing something wrong."

### The Repair Principle

If you lose your cool and yell, recognize that this is acceptable. The governing principle: **Good parents aren't perfect; good parents repair**. The capacity to repair after ruptures matters more than achieving perfect composure.

## Strategy 2: Talk About Emotions With Your Child

### The Power of Parental Self-Disclosure

One of the simplest ways to start talking about feelings in your home is by naming how you feel. Parents have feelings, and it is acceptable for children to know this. Talking about your own feelings without making children feel guilty or responsible accomplishes three teaching objectives simultaneously:

1. Teaches empathy
2. Models self-regulation
3. Helps children set boundaries between themselves and others

### The Deshaming Function

By naming and deshaming your own feelings, you teach children that having feelings is normal. You also demonstrate that talking to you about their feelings is safe.

### Scripts for Parental Emotional Disclosure

**Script 1: When Crying**
"When I'm crying, that means I'm feeling sad. Tears or no tears, I'm still your strong mom who can take care of you."

This script accomplishes dual purposes: naming the emotion while reassuring the child that the parent's emotional state does not compromise their capacity to provide care.

**Script 2: When Needing Space**
"I just wanted to tell you I feel frustrated because of work today. I'm safe and you're safe, I just need a few minutes in my room alone. You did nothing wrong. This is one of those times I need space to take care of my feelings."

Key elements: names the emotion, identifies the external cause (work), establishes safety, requests space, absolves the child of responsibility.

**Script 3: When Child Monitors Parent's Emotions**
"Am I happy? Hmm... you're paying close attention to how I feel, huh. That can be great, to notice how others feel... and it can be kind of tricky, right? It's my job to take care of my feelings, and I take that job really seriously. It's never your job to do this."

This script addresses children who become overly attuned to parental emotional states. It validates the noticing ability while establishing the boundary that caring for adult feelings is not the child's responsibility.

## Strategy 3: Help Your Child Recognize Their Own Emotions

### The Developmental Starting Point

Children come into the world with all of the emotions but none of the coping skills, not even the words for their emotions. When a toddler cannot fit puzzle pieces together, all they know is that they feel something intense inside and they need to get the feeling outside. Hence the screaming and stomping feet.

### Why Naming Emotions Works

Simply naming your child's feelings, without trying to change them or give advice, is powerful for a specific reason: When you name a feeling, you start to build your child's relationship to those intense sensations. Over time, children learn to differentiate between feelings, gaining the ability to pause and reflect before they react.

### Validation Requirement

When you name feelings, also validate that it is acceptable for your child to feel the way they do. The principle behind this: **Our feelings are important messengers about what matters to us, what we like, and what we dislike**.

### Validation Scripts

**Script 1: For Sadness**
"It's okay to cry. Tears tell us when we feel sad. I'm here with you."

**Script 2: For Excitement**
"Wow! You have so much excitement in your body! Let's think of how we can move our bodies while we wait for your friends to come over."

This script both validates the feeling and channels it into physical expression.

**Script 3: For Anger**
"You're allowed to be angry. It's hard when things don't go the way you want."

### Managing Expectations About Response

Do not expect to receive gratitude or acknowledgment such as "Thanks daddy! I do feel angry." Building emotional regulation takes time, but changes will become noticeable over time.

### Handling Resistance: The Deeply Feeling Kid

If your child resists when you talk about their feelings, there is nothing wrong with your child and nothing wrong with you. They simply need a different approach.

You may have a **Deeply Feeling Kid (DFK)**, characterized by:

- Feeling things more intensely
- Escalating quickly
- Rarely responding to "typical" parenting approaches

**Alternative strategies for DFKs**:

- Simply saying: "I'm here. I'm not scared of your big feelings"
- Using interactive games such as Thumbs Up & Down

## Strategy 4: Validate and Accept Your Child's Feelings

This strategy overlaps with Strategy 3 but emphasizes the acceptance component. The validation scripts provided above serve this function. The core message to convey is that all feelings are permitted to exist.

## Strategy 5: Allow Kids to Express All Feelings (Including Tantrums)

### Reframing Tantrums

An inconvenient truth: **Tantrums are actually a healthy sign of child development**, even though they are not enjoyable. A tantrum is a child's way of communicating: "I know what I want, even when you say no. My whole body is showing you that I'm angry/frustrated/disappointed!"

### The Parent's Job During Tantrums

Your job is NOT to end the tantrum. During a tantrum, you have exactly two jobs:

**Job 1: Keep your body calm**

Use a mantra such as: "I am safe. This isn't an emergency. I can cope with this."

**Job 2: Keep your child safe**

Safety encompasses both emotional and physical dimensions. Recognize your child's feelings while setting a firm boundary around any dangerous behavior.

Physical intervention may be necessary, meaning you might need to hold your child's wrist or pick them up.

**Script for tantrum with dangerous behavior**:
"You really want the blue shoes. You're allowed to be frustrated and I won't let you throw. I know you can find a different way to show me how you feel."

This script validates the desire, permits the emotion, sets a firm limit on the behavior, and expresses confidence in the child's ability to find an alternative expression.

### Anti-Pattern: Believing Tantrums Should Be Stopped

Allowing the tantrum is NOT reinforcing "bad behavior." Rather, it is part of helping your child learn to recognize their desires while building emotional regulation skills to manage disappointment, frustration, and anger.

### Long-Term Payoff

These emotional regulation skills developed during tantrums transfer to adult competencies: the ability to calmly ask for a raise in a first job, or to communicate needs with a partner.

## Strategy 6: Teach Coping Skills

### Key Reframe for Parents

Your child is not the problem. The lack of skills is the problem. You and your child are on the same team against the problem.

This mindset shift empowers parents to work with their child to add coping skills and tools to the child's "emotional regulation toolbox."

### Principle of Individual Differences

Different tools work for different children. Experimentation is required.

### Coping Tool 1: Mantras

Create a short mantra you and your child can use when they are having big feelings.

**Example mantras**:
- "I'm a good kid having a hard time"
- "I can do hard things"

**Why mantras work**: When our bodies feel overwhelmed, mantras offer a grounding sense of rhythm and predictability.

### Coping Tool 2: Hot Cocoa Breathing

**Hot cocoa breathing** serves as a core emotional regulation tool applicable to both adults and children.

**Technique**:
1. Pretend you are holding a cup of hot cocoa
2. Breathe in deeply with your face over your imaginary cup
3. Breathe out slowly to cool it down

### Coping Tool 3: Emotional Vaccination

**Emotional vaccination** prepares us for big moments by strengthening our regulation skills before the full-force emotion arises. The analogy: just as a vaccine prepares your body for a virus, emotional vaccination prepares your body for a feeling.

**Application example**: In the days leading up to a doctor's appointment, talk to your child about what it might feel like to go to the doctor. This advance preparation builds coping capacity before the stressful moment arrives.

## Overarching Principles

### What Parents Can and Cannot Do

Parents cannot protect children from distressing feelings in life. However, parents can prepare children to handle distress in healthy and effective ways through modeling regulation and actively teaching coping tools. Over time, these skills become second nature in the child.

### The Modeling Effect

As parents model regulation and actively teach coping tools, they help these skills become second nature in the child. The learning occurs through observation and experience, not merely through instruction.
