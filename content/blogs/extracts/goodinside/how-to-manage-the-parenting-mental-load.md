# How to Share the Parenting Mental Load

Source: Good Inside (Dr. Becky Kennedy, Clinical Psychologist)

## Core Problem Definition

The parenting **mental load** encompasses all the emotional and cognitive labor involved in caring for a family and home. This load is also called the **invisible load** or **worry work**. Unlike physical tasks, the mental load is especially tricky because it happens internally and remains unseen by others, including partners.

When couples lack clear communication about this invisible work, the bulk of the mental load falls on one person. This imbalance leads to frustration, resentment, and burnout.

## The Scope of Mental Load Tasks

Concrete examples of mental load activities include:

- Tracking the family calendar
- Researching options for kids' clothes, activities, school supplies, and similar items
- Noticing when things need to be cleaned (awareness before action)
- Remembering birthdays and anniversaries
- Monitoring household inventory and knowing when to replenish items like diapers and toilet paper
- Planning meals and creating grocery lists
- Maintaining check-ins with extended family and friends

## The Scale of the Problem

Research indicates parents spend **30.4 hours per week** coordinating family schedules and household tasks. This figure represents the mental load alone, not counting the visible physical tasks. The mental load by itself approaches the equivalent of a full-time job.

## The Gendered Dimension

Research consistently shows that mental load work primarily falls on women and mothers. This imbalance is not any individual's fault. Larger sociological and structural issues create this pattern, reinforced by decades of reliance on the unpaid labor of parents (especially mothers). Society does not recognize parenting as a job despite its fundamental importance.

## Framework for Change: Individual and Systemic

Two truths coexist:

1. Major policy changes are needed to reduce parental stress at a societal level
2. Individual changes inside homes are both possible and necessary right now

**Key insight:** When you challenge the norm inside your home, you contribute to changing the norm outside your home. Shifting dynamics in your family helps shift dynamics for all families. Personal action connects to broader social change.

# Three Strategies for Sharing the Mental Load

## Strategy 1: Make the Invisible Visible

**Core principle:** Noticing and planning the division of labor is 90% of the equation to balancing the mental load. Actually doing the labor is only 10%.

**The action step:** Write down common household tasks and who performs them. Then examine each task deeply.

### Example: The Grocery Store Task

A partner may physically go to the grocery store and believe they are helping (and they are). However, the trip to the store represents only the visible portion. The invisible work that enables the trip includes:

- Knowing what each family member likes or dislikes
- Looking at what exists in the fridge or pantry
- Planning the meals
- Making the list
- Taking inventory at home to know what goes on the list
- Problem-solving different options when something is out of stock

**Critical insight:** When one partner handles all the invisible work, the other partner cannot become aware of it. The invisible work is being done *for* them, which perpetuates their lack of awareness.

**Key teaching point:** So much of parenting and domestic labor is invisible, so we need to make it visible. Visibility is the prerequisite for sharing.

## Strategy 2: Manage Guilt

As you begin sharing the mental load, discomfort arises. Guilt creeps in with thoughts like: "I left my partner with too much to do."

### Example Scenario

Your partner takes your five-year-old to a birthday party while you meet a friend for lunch. You find yourself wondering:
- Did they get the right gift?
- Should I help them out?
- Do they have the address?
- I should jump in, I feel so guilty.

### The Two Types of Guilt

1. **Legitimate guilt:** Guilt we feel for not acting in accordance with our values
2. **False guilt:** "Guilt" that is actually someone else's disappointment or discomfort that we are absorbing

**The diagnostic question:** "Is my guilt a result of acting out of line with my values? Or am I actually taking on my partner's disappointment or discomfort?"

**The likely answer:** More often than not, the guilt you feel when delegating mental load tasks is the second type. You are absorbing discomfort that belongs to your partner, not experiencing genuine values-based guilt.

## Strategy 3: Tolerate Your Partner Doing Things Differently

The challenge here is tolerating the uncomfortable feeling of watching your partner do something differently than you would do it.

### Reframing "Different" vs. "Wrong"

You may think: "It's not just different, it's not as good!" The reframe: You are tolerating the discomfort of your partner getting something done in a way that is not as efficient or effective *in your mind* as how you would do it.

### Example: Bedtime Routines

You always read two books to your child before bed. Your partner starts handling bedtime on certain days. They sing a song and don't do any books. You feel the urge to remind them to read.

**Catch yourself and remember what's most important:**
- My partner is connecting with our kid
- My partner is getting bedtime done

The connection and completion matter more than the specific method matching your approach.

# Three Key Takeaways

1. **We all play a part in addressing the mental load gap.** By challenging the norms inside our home, we start to change the norms outside our homes too.

2. **Sharing the mental load starts with seeing it clearly.** When both partners recognize all the invisible labor that goes into raising kids, they can work toward a more balanced, supportive partnership.

3. **Practice letting go of perfection.** If your partner does something "differently," that does not mean they are doing it "wrong."

# Conceptual Framework Summary

## The 90/10 Principle

The cognitive work of noticing and planning represents 90% of the challenge. The physical execution represents only 10%. Most couples focus on dividing the 10% while leaving the 90% unaddressed and invisible.

## Visibility as Prerequisite

Nothing can be shared until it is seen. Making the invisible visible is the necessary first step before any redistribution of labor becomes possible.

## Values-Based Guilt Test

When experiencing guilt around delegating, always ask whether the guilt stems from violating your own values or from absorbing someone else's discomfort. This distinction determines whether the guilt deserves attention or should be released.

## Connection Over Method

The purpose of parenting tasks (like bedtime) is connection and care. When a partner accomplishes connection through a different method, the purpose has been fulfilled. Method variation is not failure.

## Personal Change as Social Change

Individual families changing their internal dynamics contribute to broader cultural shifts. The personal is political in the domain of domestic labor distribution.
