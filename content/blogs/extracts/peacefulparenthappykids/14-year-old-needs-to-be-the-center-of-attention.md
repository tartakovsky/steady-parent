# Helping a Teen Who Dominates Social Attention

## Core Issue: Attention-Seeking Behavior in Social Situations

A 14-year-old daughter consistently tries to be the center of attention in social situations. The parent feels embarrassed both personally and on behalf of the child. The daughter appears unaware of the problem. She has few friends and peers consider her "weird." The parent worries about damaging self-esteem while trying to help.

## Diagnostic Framework

**This is both a maturity issue and a manners issue.** Many children, particularly only children, lack an intuitive sense of how to appropriately step into and then step out of the spotlight in social situations. The behavior does not indicate a character flaw but rather a gap in social skills that were never explicitly taught.

**Key insight:** The fact that the child "has never lacked for attention at home" does not mean she has learned how to share attention with others. Receiving abundant attention is different from understanding the social mechanics of attention distribution.

## Recommended Approach: Frame It as a Manners Lesson

The recommended strategy is to address this as you would any manners issue: through direct conversation without blame.

### Why This Framing Works

- Removes shame by positioning the issue as a teaching gap rather than a character defect
- Takes responsibility away from the child ("how would you know this since I forgot to teach you?")
- Makes the skill concrete and learnable rather than vague and judgmental
- Allows parent and child to work as a team on skill development

### The Conversation Script

A specific conversation approach is provided:

**Opening:** "I've been thinking about when we were in X situation recently. I noticed that you were really enjoying talking about Y and having everyone listen to you."

**Key reframe:** "I realized that I had forgotten to teach you an important manners lesson, and of course, how would you know this since I forgot to teach you?"

**The social rule:** "In social situations, each person gets a little chance to talk about themselves or their opinion about something, and then the conversation moves on to other people's views or experiences."

**Modeling cue:** "If you watch me, you'll notice that's what I do when we're with other people."

**The standard:** "It's considered inappropriate to dominate the conversation."

**Practical solution:** "So maybe you and I can start practicing when we're in groups. We need a little signal so you can ask me if it's time for you to start focusing on other folks for awhile, and another signal so I can remind you if you forget."

### Elements of the Script

1. **Reference a specific recent situation** - grounds the conversation in reality
2. **Acknowledge what the child was experiencing** ("really enjoying talking") - validates rather than shames
3. **Take responsibility as the parent** - removes blame from the child
4. **Explain the explicit social rule** - makes implicit knowledge explicit
5. **Offer yourself as a model to observe** - provides concrete learning opportunity
6. **State the social consequence** - makes clear why this matters
7. **Propose a collaborative practice system** - creates ongoing skill development
8. **Use signals** - allows in-the-moment coaching without embarrassment

## Additional Teaching Point: Reciprocity Principle

**Point out that all people need attention and want to be listened to and respected.** If the child can offer this to others, she will always be appreciated and liked.

This reframes attention-seeking from "getting something" to "giving something" - from a deficit-based behavior to a social contribution. The child learns that offering attention to others is a path to social acceptance.

## Addressing the "Weird" Label

**Being considered "weird" at this age does not automatically indicate a problem.** Any child who is out of the ordinary may receive this label. The example given: a nearly 13-year-old who prefers reading books to watching TV and is not interested in boys is also considered "weird" by peers.

**The critical diagnostic question is not whether the child is labeled "weird" but whether she has one or more good friends.** If she does not have any good friends, then she may need help with social skills or "something more" (implying potentially deeper issues that warrant further exploration).

## What Not To Do

- **Do not ignore the issue** - this will not help the daughter
- **Do not shame her** - this is the equal and opposite error from ignoring
- **Do not approach it as a character flaw** - frame it as a skill gap instead

## Implicit Principles

### The Balance Problem

The parent faces a tension between:
- Not wanting to shame the child or damage self-esteem
- Recognizing that ignoring the problem does not help

**The resolution is to address the issue directly but without blame** - by framing it as a teaching gap rather than a personal failing.

### Explicit Teaching of Implicit Social Rules

Many social skills that adults take for granted are not intuitive - they must be explicitly taught. This is especially true for:
- Only children who have less sibling-based socialization
- Children who receive abundant attention at home but have not practiced attention-sharing

### In-the-Moment Coaching System

**The signal system** allows for real-time correction without public embarrassment:
- One signal for the child to ask "should I shift focus to others now?"
- One signal for the parent to remind the child to shift focus

This creates a private communication channel that enables practice in actual social situations.

## Parent Validation

The parent's sensitivity and concern for the daughter are described as "the best assets she could have at this difficult point in her life." The instinct to worry about this is valid - this is not being a "worry wart." The concern for balancing help with not damaging self-esteem reflects appropriate attunement to the developmental challenges of this age.
