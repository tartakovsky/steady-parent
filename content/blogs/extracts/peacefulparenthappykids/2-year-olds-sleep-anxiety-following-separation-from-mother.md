# Helping a Toddler Overcome Sleep Anxiety After Separation from Parent

## The Core Problem: Suppressed Fear After Separation

When a toddler experiences a major separation from their primary caregiver (such as a parent's hospitalization), they have big feelings of panic that they cannot handle because the caregiver is gone. So they push those feelings away.

**The mechanism of suppressed emotions**: When humans are willing to let their feelings sweep through them, those feelings then evaporate. But when we push them away, they are stored in the body, making us tense and tightly wound. These "repressed" feelings press to come up and out, and can cause behavior problems, clinginess, and sleep issues.

**Why symptoms appear with delay**: Once the parent returns, the child will hopefully feel safe enough to let those feelings surface, which means to feel and express them. This explains why a child may only begin showing bedtime anxiety weeks after the parent returns from hospital. It takes time for the child to be reassured that the parent is really home to stay, so that they feel safe letting their fear come up.

**The child's underlying fear**: Even toddlers understand that a parent's absence could become permanent, because it is a life or death matter to them. A child cannot articulate "I am worried you will vanish and never return" but any child who has endured a week's separation would be feeling this. They may instead focus their fear on something else (like Santa) because they cannot put words to the real terror.

## How Separation Anxiety Manifests at Bedtime

The reaction to buried fear is that the child is no longer comfortable snuggling down to fall asleep. Instead, they want a parent in the room with them. Then, when they awaken slightly during the normal light phases of the sleep cycle, they check to be sure the parent is there. When the parent is not there, they call out.

This is completely normal behavior for a child worried that a parent will disappear again. But because the child is not so exhausted during night wakings (since they have just slept for a number of hours), they do not fall back to sleep so easily, requiring the parent to sit with them in the wee hours.

**Physical symptoms connection**: It is possible that a chest infection or other illness is related to the child's emotions, since children especially feel everything in their bodies, and major separations give them a lot to cope with.

## What NOT to Do

### Do Not Leave the Child to Cry Alone

Leaving a child to cry alone will make their fear worse. Even if the child "learns" to sleep, they will actually be learning that the parent does not come when they call. Their fear will get bigger and come out in other ways during the day, in difficult behavior.

### Do Not Transition to a Toddler Bed During This Period

Transitioning to a toddler bed is a big change for children and tends to make them insecure and nervous. Many children begin getting out of bed at night once they are in a toddler bed. For an already anxious child, this would likely lead to them ending up in the parents' bed or needing a parent to lie with them all night to keep them asleep - exactly the "habits" parents want to avoid.

**Wait until the anxiety is resolved before making the bed transition.**

## Two Approaches to Resolution

### Option 1: Wait It Out

Continue the current approach of sitting with the child while they fall asleep, and hope that as the parent's health improves, the hospital separation recedes into the past, and the child gains maturity, they will begin soothing themselves back to sleep.

**This will eventually work.** However, it could take a long time, maybe as much as a year. The reason is that the habit of needing the parent to fall asleep will get more firmly established the longer it goes on. The child's increased maturity and re-solidified sense of safety will eventually outweigh that habit, but will take time to do so.

### Option 2: Help the Child Feel and Express the Fear (Recommended)

Help the child to feel and express to the parent all those fears that are keeping them from relaxing into sleep without the parent's presence. This is recommended because it is what the child really needs.

This approach involves three components, done in sequence:
1. Play
2. Connect
3. Help the child cry

## Component 1: Play - Accessing and Releasing Anxiety Through Giggles

**Why play works**: Giggling releases the same anxieties that crying does. Play games that get the child giggling to begin accessing the upsetting fear and expressing it.

**Important**: Do NOT use tickling. Tickling actually seems to increase fear and build up stress hormones. Use any kind of play other than tickling that gets the child giggling, with as much warmth as possible.

### Recommended Physical Play Games

**Bucking bronco**: Have dad get on all fours with the child on his back, scrabbling around the room and trying to (gently) toss the child off. Go for giggles.

**Airplane**: Toss the child in the air, or zoom them wildly around the house.

### Separation Games (Especially Important)

Separation games are particularly important for the parent who was absent to play with the child.

**"Please Don't Leave Me" game**:
- When reading to the child and they start to get off your lap, pull them back to you
- Tell them how much you love holding them, and please don't go away from you ever, and you want to hold them always
- Keep your voice light and playful rather than needy so the child feels free to pull away
- Keep scooping them back to you and begging them to stay
- Go for giggles

**The purpose**: This heals the feelings inside the child of how much they needed and wanted the parent when the parent left. The child now gets to play the "leaver" role.

**"Bye Bye Game"** (excellent for separation anxiety):
- A simple version of Hide and Seek that triggers just a little separation anxiety, just enough to get the child giggling
- Say "Let's play Bye-bye. If you want me, yell Peanut Butter" (or whatever the child would think is funny)
- Hide behind the couch or door for just a moment before YOU yell "Peanut Butter" and run out, and hug them
- Say "I missed you! Ok, let me try that again" and go hide again
- Come back out before the child yells for you, which should get them giggling, especially if you play-act being silly and excessively worried
- Keep playing this, with you trying to yell first - and not really leaving - as long as they are giggling

**The mechanism**: This surfaces the child's anxieties about being separated from the parent in a safe, playful way.

### What If the Child Won't Giggle?

Sometimes when children have stuffed down a lot of fear, they can get very serious and find it harder to giggle. Don't give up. Notice what makes them laugh and do more of it, no matter how silly it is. The more giggling the better to help them let up all that fear.

### Why Start with Play

Play is essential to begin with because even if the child still needs to cry to express their fear (which is likely), the play will bring the fear closer to the surface so it can easily come up and out.

This strategy alone (play) will almost certainly help the child sleep better.

## Component 2: Connect - Rebuilding the Bond

**Why connection matters even with a strong bond**: When kids close off their feelings, they lose some connection to themselves, and therefore to parents. Even with a strong existing bond, the child needs some strengthening of the connection. That will help them feel safe enough to let the terror inside them out.

**The prescription**: Have at least half an hour every day to simply focus completely on the child and pour your love into them. Do whatever they want during that time, to build connection and trust.

**During this time**:
- If they are playing, just sit with them and watch them play
- You can make comments occasionally like "Now the red truck is racing the blue truck" or whatever
- Mostly just adore them and let them direct the play

## Component 3: Help the Child Cry - The Emotional Release Process

After a week of strong connecting and lots of giggling play, the child may be able to settle without you in the room. However, if that is not the case, it means they have more panic inside them that needs to come out, and they need your help to surface it.

### The Key Distinction: Crying WITH vs. Crying ALONE

**Critical**: The child needs to cry in a parent's arms, or with at least one or both parents in close proximity. It is essential that a parent (ideally the one who was absent, since they seem to be at the core of the anxiety) is present, helping the child feel safe enough to feel those upsetting fears.

This is NOT suggesting leaving the child alone to cry. It IS giving them the safety of a parent's presence so they can finally "show" the terror locked inside them, and let it go.

**Why crying alone doesn't work**: We know the child will cry if the parent leaves the room, but that doesn't help because the child will not feel safe in the parent's absence. It will just re-traumatize them. Instead, we need to help the child cry in the parent's presence.

### Natural Opportunities for Emotional Release

Children have an instinct for healing themselves. The child may create an opportunity to cry by having a meltdown about something that seems inconsequential to adults. If the child begins to sob or reacts angrily to something that disappoints them, remind yourself that they are seizing this opportunity to "vent" some big feelings. Welcome those emotions.

### What the Emotional Release May Look Like

The child might simply cry. But often when children express fear that has been locked up inside them, it looks like they are fighting for their lives:
- They might struggle against you
- Sweat
- Get red-faced
- Yell

**What to do**:
- Protect yourself, but stay as close as possible
- If they try to hit you, hold them as gently as possible so they can't hurt you
- Breathe deeply
- Remind yourself that they are doing exactly what they need to do
- Stay calm (which takes a lot of deep breathing and talking yourself through it)

**What to say**: "You are safe... I am right here... I am not going anywhere... I am so sorry I was gone in the hospital, Sweetie... I know you were scared... but you are safe... I am here, and your dad is here."

### The Bedtime Crying Protocol (If Needed)

If the child does not find a way to get upset about something during daily life, use bedtime to help them cry - that's when their fears naturally surface.

**Important**: Do not do this until you have at least a week of daily connection time and concentrated play, to build up a strong bond of trust and loosen up the fear so it can pour out.

#### Step 1: Preparation with Stuffed Animals

Before bedtime, take the child's stuffed animals and act out the bedtime routine:
- Have a mom and dad stuffed animal tuck the baby into bed
- Kiss the baby goodnight and leave the room
- Have the baby protest and the parents reassure them
- Act out the whole bedtime routine as it used to successfully happen
- Have the baby snuggle down and go to sleep easily when the parents leave

**Purpose**: This shows the child what will happen and helps them see how positively things can go.

#### Step 2: Announce the Plan

Tell the child that tonight you will be doing what the animal family did, and what you used to do.

**The underlying goal**: You aren't actually going to leave them alone - that's not the goal. The goal is to help the child face their fear by having them imagine the thing they are so frightened of (being left alone). You won't actually leave them alone because that would re-traumatize them without you being there to help them heal. But you do need to re-open the trauma in order to help them, by reminding them of all those horrible feelings when you were gone, but doing it while you are with them so they feel safe enough to cry.

**Analogy**: Think of this as cleaning a wound that has been festering. It will allow them to heal. And you will be with them the whole time.

#### Step 3: Working Through the Fear

**If they begin to cry and protest when you explain the plan**: That's a good thing. Welcome those emotions as described above.

**If they don't react**: They are either not understanding or hoping that you won't follow through. Keep gently reminding them throughout the bedtime routine that tonight you and dad will leave the room and they will sleep by themselves. Tell them that they are completely safe, and you are right there in your own room near them. Sooner or later their upset will surface.

**If they remain calm through the routine**: Continue with the bedtime routine as you used to, and head for the door.

**When they cry at the door**: Stop right where you are, and reassure them that they are safe. Go back to them and touch and hold them.

**If holding stops them from crying**: Start for the door but only go as far from them as you need to for them to cry. The goal is to help them cry in your presence.

**Distance calibration**: When they cry, use your voice to reassure them. Think of yourself as the witness to their traumatic experience, which they are now telling you about. Stay 100% focused on them and pour your love out to them even if you can't touch them - they will sense it. Stay as close as you can to reassure them, but not so close that their upset vanishes.

**If they get more upset**: Go to them and hold them. Then, once calm, start over.

**If uncomfortable with how upset they are**: Move closer so they calm a bit. If they will cry with you holding them, that's terrific.

**If they want to be picked up**: That's fine, but if they stop crying, tell them you will be putting them down again, so they can continue crying.

**If they struggle against you when picked up**: That is their fear being released, so that is great. Keep breathing and reminding yourself that they are letting up old fear.

### After the Emotional Release

Once the child finishes crying, they will probably simply fall asleep. If not, they will simply be peaceful and yawning. At that point, hold them and tell them how much you love them and that they did good, hard work. When they're ready, put them in bed. They will almost certainly snuggle down and sleep.

**If they don't settle**: If you are up for more hard work, you can repeat the whole process. If you don't have the internal resources left inside you to stay calm - at any point - you can simply sit in their room while they fall asleep. Just tell them that you will stay tonight but tomorrow you will leave the room. Then repeat the entire thing the next night.

### Handling Night Wakings During This Process

During the night, if the child wakes up, you will probably be too tired to be fully present with their crying. That full presence matters because it is what helps them feel safe. Given that, don't do the crying protocol in the middle of the night. Just do what you have been doing, where you stay in their room. They will probably fall asleep fairly easily given that they have already released a lot of fear.

### Timeline and Variations

**Possible outcomes**:
- It may take only one session of crying
- You may not even need the bedtime session if the play and connection alone help them settle, or if they cry about some pretext during the day
- You may need to do a bedtime session every day for a week to help them dissolve and release their panic

**Observable result**: Over the course of a week or so, you will see the child become much more relaxed (at all times) and able, finally, to return to their previous relaxed trust in bed.

## Why This Is Different from Sleep Training

What is described here is very hard work because it requires the parent to stay calm, but also to really see the child's terror. You can't just leave the room and leave them to cry, or they won't actually process the emotions and they will come out in some other way.

**The distinction**: The parent IS helping the child cry so they can release the emotions that are getting in their way. But the parent maintains presence and connection throughout, which is what allows actual emotional processing rather than suppression.

---

## If the Full Protocol Feels Like Too Much

There is no harm in waiting and continuing the current approach (sitting with them) for as long as you want to. It may be that you want to wait to get stronger physically before doing this hard work.

**However**: The child does need a chance at some point to surface these fears and release them, or they will continue to try to find their way out. So at minimum, begin with the play component now.

## Important Considerations

### Involvement of Both Parents

Because the healing revolves around the absent parent's previous absence (and current reduced involvement in care), it seems essential that the absent parent be present and as involved as possible in this process. However, the other parent will probably have to be very involved as well, especially if the absent parent has physical limitations.

### Contributing Factors to Watch

Multiple factors can compound a child's anxiety:
- Unplanned nature of a parent's emergency (the child picks up on parental stress about "an emergency")
- Ongoing changes in the parent's physical abilities and interaction with the child
- Changes in who is primary caregiver
- Holiday stress and schedule changes
- Fears about seasonal figures (like Santa)
- Vacation from regular childcare routine
- Presence of additional adults (grandparents helping), even if positive
- Illness (chest infections may have emotional components)
- Teething

All of these combined create a lot for a toddler to cope with.
