## Understanding the Behavior: Why Children Make Threats

**Threats as power experimentation**: When a young child tells another child "I want you dead," they have typically just discovered an amazing tool to make themselves feel powerful. The child is experimenting with power and intimidation, which is described as a "time-honored tradition for five year olds."

**This behavior is developmentally adjacent to normal preschool behavior**: Saying "I want you dead" is not so different from the preschooler who says "I hate you. I'm not inviting you to my birthday party." Any preschool teacher can confirm that this kind of strong exclusionary language is standard behavior for a four year old. By age five, children are usually starting to be able to handle conflict without resorting to such strong language, which means a five-year-old doing this may need some additional support to develop those skills.

**The behavior indicates a skill gap, not pathology**: Does threatening language mean a child will grow up to be dangerous? Unlikely. It means they're five. However, it does indicate the child needs help learning more appropriate ways of negotiating peer conflict than "pulling out the nuclear threat."

**Why schools must take it seriously**: Five year olds have been known to get their hands on guns and use them. Even when parents are confident there is no actual danger, any responsible school knows that when a kid threatens another kid it needs to be taken seriously. The school is being responsible in making this kind of language off-limits, and parents would be doing their child no favor to allow them to interact with peers this way regardless of what the school allows.

## Diagnostic Framework: When to Seek Professional Help

**Single-issue vs. multiple-issue assessment**: If the threatening behavior is the only issue the child is having, then strict but empathic limit-setting combined with coaching better peer social/emotional skills should solve the issue. If the child is acting out in other ways, then they do need help from a psychologist.

**Consequence effectiveness test**: If a consequence has to be applied more than twice and the behavior continues, the consequence isn't working. This indicates one of two things:
1. The child doesn't perceive the consequence as unpleasant
2. The child is getting something very rewarding out of threatening other kids

Either scenario means the child needs help from a psychologist.

## The Strict But Empathic Limit-Setting Framework

### Setting the Limit Clearly

The limit must be set in no uncertain terms: Tell the child that threats are absolutely never allowed. Something unpleasant will happen if the child in any way threatens another child.

### Coordinating Consequences with School

Sit down with the school and agree on the consequence, tell the child the rule, and then stick to it. Consistency between home and school is essential.

### Example Consequence: Loss of Recess

If the consequence is that the child is not allowed to go to recess with the other kids, then no exception should be made.

**Critical caveat for high-needs children**: Depriving a high-needs child of recess is a recipe for a meltdown later in the day. If this is the agreed-upon consequence, make sure you take the child to the playground on those afternoons so they can let off steam. However, do not link the two events so the child doesn't see the playground as a reward for the consequence.

### Example Consequence: Being Sent Home

If the school insists that the consequence is that the child will be sent home, you will need to be sure that home becomes boring and non-rewarding. Many children like to be home with their parent, especially if the parent lets them watch TV. The home environment must not inadvertently reinforce the behavior by being more pleasant than school.

## Coaching Better Peer Social/Emotional Skills

Even after the threatening behavior stops due to consequences, the child still needs coaching in better peer social/emotional skills. The consequence addresses the immediate behavior, but skill-building addresses the underlying need.

### Discussion When Calm

Have a discussion with your child when they are not angry about how they think it makes someone feel to hear these threatening comments.

**Validate the underlying emotion**: Agree with the child that when we're mad it's hard not to say angry things. Acknowledge that you know they are mad when they say these things.

**Frame the limit clearly**: Explain that threatening physical harm is like hitting - it is always off limits.

**Practice alternative responses**: Ask the child how they could handle the same situation if it happens tomorrow. Giving the child a chance to act it out with you will prime their subconscious so that they are more likely to act appropriately when they find themselves angry again. This rehearsal approach prepares the child's automatic responses.

### Understanding Anger as a Secondary Emotion

**Anger is always a response to underlying hurt, fear, or sadness**. This is a core principle that shapes how to help the child process their feelings.

**Encourage emotional expression**: Let the child blow off steam by talking about how angry they were at the other kid. Reflect what they're saying so they feel heard and understood: "Wow, you were very angry at him!"

**Help identify underlying feelings**: Tell the child anger is normal, but help them let go of the anger by becoming aware of the feelings underneath. Example reflection: "Sounds like you were hurt when Henry called you that name... so you wanted to hurt him back, so you said angry things to him." This connects the anger to the root cause and the threatening behavior to the hurt, creating understanding of the full emotional chain.

### Teaching Anger Management Strategies

Teach concrete strategies the child can use to manage their anger and frustration in the moment:

- **Physical release tool**: Carry a squeezy ball in their pocket to squeeze when angry
- **Self-regulation technique**: Learn to close their eyes, breathe, and count to ten
- **Verbal self-regulation script**: Teach them to say "I am really mad and I don't want to say anything mean so I am going to get a drink of water and calm down." This combines acknowledgment of emotion, statement of intent, and a concrete action to create distance from the situation.

### Teaching Negotiation and Problem-Solving

**Introduce the win-win problem-solving concept**: "We can find a solution that works for everyone."

**Example application**: "Jeremy wants to play soccer. Jake wants to play tag. What could you both enjoy doing?" The children may decide to play tag and then soccer. Or they may climb on the jungle gym. Either way, no one loses. The key insight is that conflicts can be resolved without anyone having to give up or feel defeated.

## Addressing the Root Cause: The Need for Power

**Power-seeking as the underlying driver**: Much like a toddler reveling in the power of "no," children are more likely to threaten peers if that's the only time they get to feel powerful.

**Solution**: Make sure the child gets plenty of opportunities to make their own choices and feel powerful in their life so they don't have so much need to feel powerful with their classmates. When children have appropriate outlets for feeling autonomous and in control, they have less need to use threatening language to achieve that feeling.

## Examining Your Own Discipline Methods

**Model what you want to see**: Don't use discipline strategies that make use of:
- Threats
- Power plays (punishment of any sort)
- Social exclusion (timeouts)

The reason to avoid these methods is that you don't want to model those very behaviors you're trying to eliminate in your child. If you use threats and power plays to control your child, they learn that threats and power plays are how you handle conflict with others.

**Alternative approach**: Set appropriate limits, enforced with empathy.

**The empathy training effect**: Children whose parents use empathy as their primary parenting tool are receiving constant training in empathy and are much less likely to be mean to others. The parenting approach itself becomes implicit social-emotional education.

**Evidence base**: Positive discipline has been shown to result in better behavior than punishment.

## Key Distinctions

**"I want you dead" vs. "I will make you dead"**: While technically one is a statement of desire and one is a direct threat, this is "splitting hairs." It's a short distance from one to the other, and both should be treated as unacceptable.

**Consequence vs. reward confusion**: When implementing consequences that involve missing activities, if you provide alternative outlets (like taking the child to the playground after they missed recess), you must not link the two events. If the child perceives the alternative activity as a reward connected to the consequence, it undermines the effectiveness of the limit-setting.

**Limit-setting vs. skill-building**: These are two separate necessary interventions. The consequence stops the immediate behavior, but without skill-building, the child lacks alternative tools and the behavior may resurface in other forms.
