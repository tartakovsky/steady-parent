# Why a 3-Year-Old Won't Use the Potty for Bowel Movements (And How to Address It)

## Core Principle: This Is Normal, Not a Parenting Failure

It is **very common** for a 3.5-year-old to resist using the potty for bowel movements while happily using it for urination. This has nothing to do with not spending enough time with the child. The behavior stems from identifiable physical and psychological causes, each with specific solutions.

## The Six Most Common Reasons and Their Solutions

### 1. Fear of Falling Into the Toilet

**Who this applies to:** Children using a full-sized toilet rather than a small potty chair.

**How to identify:** The child shows anxiety specifically about the toilet, not about the potty.

**Solution:** If using a potty chair, this is likely not the issue. The potty eliminates the falling-in fear because it's low to the ground and child-sized.

### 2. Negative Experiences at Preschool

**Why this matters:** Preschool is a common site for potty-related trauma that carries home.

**What to investigate:**
- What happens when the child needs a BM at preschool?
- Do they change diapers there, or is there ridicule involved?
- If staff ridicule the child, a **power struggle** may have developed, causing the child to cling to diapers as a form of resistance
- Does the preschool have small potties, or only full-sized toilets?
- If the child only uses a potty at home but faces a big toilet at school, nervousness is natural

**A specific warning:** Children at preschool can become frightened when they witness another child "fall into" the toilet. This is worth asking about because it's a commonly reported trigger.

### 3. The Body Is Accustomed to Squatting

**This is the most common reason** children resist using the potty for BMs.

**The physical mechanics:**
- When defecating in a diaper, children naturally squat
- On a toilet, feet dangle, which tightens rectal muscles and makes pushing difficult
- Even on a potty, the sitting-back position differs from squatting, requiring the body to relearn how to defecate

**The solution - equipment change:**
- Get a very simple, very low potty (Baby Bjorn "Smart Potty" is specifically recommended)
- The potty must be **low enough that the child's knees are higher than their bottom**
- The child's feet must be flat on the floor
- This recreates the squatting position that their body knows

**If using a toilet instead of a potty:** Consider a specialized stool that positions the child's body correctly (squatty-potty style positioning).

### 4. The Child Wants Privacy

**Why this is normal:** It's developmentally typical for little ones to "hide" when having a BM.

**The initial approach:**
- Identify where the child usually goes to have a BM in their diaper
- Put the new potty in that location
- Tell them they can squat over it while still wearing their diaper

**The problem with this approach:** You have to follow them there to ensure they actually use the potty, which defeats the privacy purpose.

**A better approach (if BMs happen at a predictable time):**
1. Make a big deal about the new potty
2. Frame it as "special alone time" with the potty
3. Tell them they can keep their diaper on (this is key - see section 6)
4. The requirement: they must squat over the potty in the bathroom
5. Combine with incentives (see section 5)

### 5. The Child Needs an Incentive

**The underlying psychology:** From the child's perspective, using the potty serves the parent's benefit, not theirs. The child is comfortable with their current habit. Changing a physical habit is hard and even scary.

**Why incentives are appropriate here:**
- The author doesn't generally recommend rewards beyond parental hugs
- However, this specific transition often leads to children "holding" their BMs
- Holding causes constipation, which makes BMs painful
- Painful BMs cause more avoidance, creating a vicious cycle
- Breaking the cycle early is worth providing external motivation

**Specific incentive strategy - the toy basket:**
1. Create a small basket of wrapped small gifts
2. Child chooses one to open and play with while squatting over the potty
3. Critical twist: after a successful BM, the child plays with the toy for two hours, then it goes back in the basket
4. Looking forward to playing with the toy again becomes motivation to return to the potty
5. This doesn't require buying many toys since they rotate back into the basket

**Alternative incentive - the video game approach:**
- One family used a hand-held video game available only during potty time
- This was "very quick and effective" in solving what had become an "intransigent problem" where the son "adamantly refused" to use the potty
- The key: the highly desirable item exists only in the potty context

### 6. Fear of Having a BM Without the Diaper On

**This is VERY common.** The child is accustomed to the physical sensation of the diaper during bowel movements and feels insecure without it.

**The gradual transition process:**

**Phase 1 - Normalize the bathroom location:**
- Tell the child they can go in their diaper, no problem
- The only requirement: wear the diaper while sitting on the potty
- After each BM, change them in the bathroom
- Let them help flush the diaper contents
- Reinforce: "BMs go in the toilet"
- Warning: Only do the flushing step if the child isn't afraid of the toilet. Let the child be the one to flush.
- Continue this phase for a couple of weeks to solidify the habit of going to the bathroom for BMs

**Phase 2 - Gradually loosen the diaper:**
- Start loosening the diaper so it's still on/under them but not tight
- Day by day, loosen it more
- Eventually they're having BMs ON the diaper, but it's not attached to them

**Phase 3 - Remove the diaper:**
- Once they're going with a loose, unattached diaper, it's a small step to remove it as they sit down
- The child is now using the potty

**Why this elaborate process is worth it:** The child is 3.5 and set in her ways. Fighting with a child about their body is a fight you won't win. This gradual approach respects the child's autonomy while still achieving the goal.

## The Power Struggle Dynamic

**What the parent did right:** By never scolding and using only gentle reminders, the parent has side-stepped any power struggle. This is "terrific restraint."

**Why this matters:** Once a power struggle develops around potty use, the child digs in and the situation becomes much harder to resolve.

**What doesn't work:**
- Telling the child about future activities (like swimming lessons) they can do "if they get potty trained" - this is a form of pressure
- "Gentle reminders that #2 goes in the potty too" - even this creates a sense of expectation
- Any form of scolding or punishment

**What the parent should consider now:** Since no power struggle exists, it may be time to add incentives and the gradual diaper-loosening approach.

## A Personal Example That Worked

**The story:** Dr. Laura's son at the same age (around 3.5) would pee in the toilet but needed a diaper for BMs.

**What she said during a diaper change:** "I'll be glad when you decide to use the toilet for BMs."

**The child's reaction:** He was shocked and asked "Why?" - indicating this had never really sunk in despite being told that BMs go in the toilet.

**Her response:** "Because I love you, but I don't love changing poopy diapers."

**The result:** He never used his diaper for BMs again.

**Why this worked:**
- It expressed a genuine parental preference
- It wasn't framed as a power struggle
- It didn't involve punishment
- It gave the child a reason that made sense from an interpersonal perspective (mom doesn't enjoy this task)
- The child realized for the first time that his behavior affected his parent in a way he hadn't considered

**The principle:** It's okay to express your preference, as long as it isn't a power struggle and doesn't involve punishment. Sometimes children simply haven't connected the dots about why the change matters to anyone.

## What Not to Do

- Don't assume the problem is caused by not spending enough time with the child - this isn't the cause
- Don't use the big toilet if the child is only comfortable with the potty (or vice versa) without addressing the difference
- Don't expect a child to defecate successfully with dangling feet - the body mechanics don't work
- Don't force the child to be without their diaper before they're ready - use the gradual loosening technique
- Don't let the flushing happen if the child fears the toilet
- Don't turn this into a power struggle through punishment, excessive pressure, or repeated reminders
- Don't ignore the constipation risk - if a child starts holding BMs, the situation gets worse rapidly due to pain creating more avoidance
