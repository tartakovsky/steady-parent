# Five Resolutions for Becoming a Better Parent

## The Myth of Perfect Parenting and Why Repeat Resolutions Aren't Failure

Many parents avoid making New Year's resolutions because they find themselves making the same ones every year. However, this pattern does not indicate failure. Instead, it signals that you're headed in the right direction and simply haven't achieved perfection yet. The reality is that you won't be perfect this year either, and you don't have to be.

**What children actually need from parents:**
- Parents who accept both the child and themselves with all their imperfections
- Parents who model compassion and respect
- Parents who apologize and reconnect when things go wrong (which will inevitably happen)
- Parents who love themselves as they are while still wanting to grow

The key insight here is that children don't need perfection. They need authenticity, repair, and connection.

## Why "Resolving to Be More Patient" Rarely Works

The resolution to be more patient typically fails because of how our stress response works. By the time we're gritting our teeth trying to stay "patient," we're already sliding into the fight-or-flight stress response. Willpower alone cannot override this physiological state.

The underlying problem is that patience isn't something you can simply decide to have more of. It's the natural byproduct of being emotionally regulated. This means the real work is about regulating your own emotions, not forcing yourself to act calm while internally dysregulated.

## Resolution 1: Work on Regulating Your Own Emotions by Giving Yourself More Support

### The Core Principle

The resolution shouldn't be about trying harder. It should be about having the right support. This is the only way to become the emotionally generous parent you want to be.

### Sustainable Self-Nurturing Practices

To regulate emotions effectively, you need to integrate daily sustainable self-nurturing:

- **Go to bed earlier** so you're better rested (fatigue depletes emotional resources)
- **Eat healthfully** to maintain your energy levels
- **Transform inner negative comments into encouraging ones** (the internal dialogue matters)
- **Give yourself compassion when you mess up** (self-criticism depletes the emotional reserves needed for patience)
- **Slow down your pace** so you're not so stressed (rushing creates chronic stress that makes regulation harder)

### The Critical Practice: Managing Your Reactions

**The most important commitment:** Say no to taking any action while you're angry.

The reasoning behind this is neurological. When you're in fight or flight, your child looks like the enemy, and you cannot teach effectively from that state. The urgency to act that you feel when upset is itself a signal that you're in fight-or-flight mode.

**What to do instead:** Calm your own upset before you engage with your child.

### The Rewiring Effect

Every time you restrain your own "tantrum," you are literally rewiring your brain. Each time you choose love over reaction, it makes the next choice easier. This is how lasting change happens: not through willpower in the moment, but through gradually strengthening new neural pathways.

**The downstream effect:** You'll be astonished at how your child changes as YOU get better at self-regulating. The parent's regulation is the foundation that enables the child's regulation.

## Resolution 2: Love the One You're With

### The Fundamental Truth About Child Development

The one thing known for certain about child development is that kids who feel loved and cherished thrive. This is a crucial distinction. It is not about kids who ARE loved. Many children whose parents love them don't thrive. The kids who thrive are specifically the ones who FEEL loved and cherished for exactly who they are.

This means love must be expressed in ways the child can receive and internalize, not just felt by the parent.

### Why This Is Challenging

Every child is unique, so it takes a different approach for each child to feel safe, seen, and valued. What works for one child may not work for another.

**The hard work for parents:** Accepting who your child actually is, challenges and all, and cherishing them for being that person, even while guiding their behavior.

### The Secret to Making Children Feel Loved

Three core practices:
1. **See it from their perspective** (perspective-taking)
2. **Empathize with them** (emotional attunement)
3. **Celebrate every step in the right direction** (positive reinforcement of growth)

**Perhaps most important:** Enjoy your child! The experience of being genuinely enjoyed by a parent communicates love in a way that words alone cannot.

## Resolution 3: Stay Connected

### Why Connection Is the Foundation of Cooperation

Kids only cooperate and "follow" parental leadership when they feel connected. Without connection, you have no influence. This is not a flaw in children. It's how human relationships work.

**Key insight:** Separation happens constantly throughout the day, so we have to repeatedly reconnect. Connection is not a one-time achievement but an ongoing practice.

### Quality Time Is About Connection, Not Teaching

Quality time should be mostly unstructured because it's about connection, not instruction. Teaching shifts the dynamic from connection to hierarchy.

### Specific Connection Practices

**Morning and departures:**
- Hug your child first thing every morning
- Hug every time you say goodbye

**Reunions (the 15-minute reconnection):**
- When reunited later in the day, put your phone away
- Spend fifteen minutes solely focused on your child

**What to do in those 15 minutes:**
- Listen
- Commiserate
- Hug
- Roughhouse
- Laugh
- Play
- Empathize
- Listen some more

**Response to "not enough time":** What could be more important? This reframes the 15 minutes not as optional but as a priority that supersedes other tasks.

**Evening practices:**
- Stop working and turn off phone and computer before dinner to focus on family
- Eat dinner together without screens
- Do a lot of listening during dinner
- Have a chat and warm snuggle at bedtime every night with each child

**The power of laughter:** Laugh as much as you can. Laughter is a powerful connector and stress reliever.

## Resolution 4: Role Model Respect

### The Core Principle

If you want to raise kids who are considerate and respectful right through the teen years, you must speak to them respectfully. Kids learn from what parents model. If parents can't manage their own emotions, they can't expect kids to learn to manage theirs.

### The Challenge

Speaking respectfully is not always easy when you're angry. This is why mantras are helpful. They provide pre-planned thoughts to redirect the mind when emotional reactivity is high.

### Five Mantras for Staying Regulated

1. **"It's not an emergency."** (This counters the urgency that fight-or-flight creates)
2. **"I'm the role model."** (Reminds you that your behavior is being observed and absorbed)
3. **"He's acting like a child because he IS a child."** (Reframes behavior as developmentally appropriate rather than intentionally provocative)
4. **"Don't take it personally."** (The child's behavior is usually about their internal state, not about you)
5. **"This too shall pass!"** (Provides perspective that the difficult moment is temporary)

## Resolution 5: Stay Curious About the Needs and Feelings Driving Your Child's Behavior

### The Reframe on "Misbehavior"

**All "misbehavior" is a red flag** that your child needs help handling big emotions or filling unmet needs. Behavior is communication. When you address the underlying feelings or needs, the behavior changes naturally.

This reframe shifts the parent from adversary (trying to stop bad behavior) to ally (trying to help the child with their underlying struggle).

### Three Strategies for Addressing Behavior

1. **Lead by loving example** (modeling the behavior you want to see)

2. **Redirect preemptively rather than punish**
   - Example: "You can throw the ball outside" (offers acceptable alternative before the problem escalates)

3. **Set limits empathically**
   - Example: "I see how mad and sad you are. You can tell your sister how you feel without attacking her."
   - This acknowledges the emotion while still holding the boundary on behavior

### The Outcome

When you use these approaches, you raise self-disciplined kids who WANT to follow your guidance. The key word is "want." Compliance achieved through fear or punishment doesn't build self-discipline. Internal motivation does.

### The Most Important Time to Connect

**The most important time to stay connected with your child is when they're acting out.** This is counterintuitive because acting out often triggers parental withdrawal or punishment. But this is precisely when the child most needs connection, and when providing connection has the greatest impact.

## The Philosophy of Constant Course Correction

Children will make mistakes. Parents will make mistakes. There are no perfect parents, no perfect children, and no perfect families. But there are families who live in the embrace of great love, where everyone thrives.

**How such families are created:** By making daily choices that take you in that direction. It's not magic. It's the hard work of constant course correction to get back on track when life inevitably throws you off.

Making the same resolutions every year is actually a positive sign. It means you're keeping yourself on track by choosing, over and over, to take positive steps in the right direction. Eventually, you'll find yourself in a whole new landscape.

**The reframe on parenting:** Parenting is a journey, not a destination. For today, just choose less drama and more love. This simple daily choice accumulates into transformation over time.

## When the Resolutions Feel Too Hard: The Need for Support

If keeping these resolutions sounds like too big a lift, that signals you need more support. This is some of the hardest work anyone ever does. The solution is to figure out what you need to give yourself every day to help you stay on track.

### Forms of Support to Consider

- Inspiring parenting audios to listen to daily
- Books on parenting
- Working with a parenting coach or counselor
- Taking a structured online course

### The Core Message About Self-Support

**Giving yourself support is not selfish. It's the best gift you could give your family.** The logic here is that you cannot pour from an empty cup. Supporting yourself enables you to show up for your family.
