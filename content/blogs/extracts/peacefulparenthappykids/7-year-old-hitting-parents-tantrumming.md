## Core Problem
A 7-year-old boy exhibits aggressive behaviors (hitting parents, throwing things, clinging to prevent movement, tearing clothes) when he doesn't get what he wants immediately or experiences jealousy toward his younger sibling.

## Key Insights

### 1. The Root Cause: Intolerance of Disappointment
- The underlying belief driving the behavior is that the child cannot tolerate disappointment
- When negative feelings arise (sadness, disappointment), they feel unbearable
- Anger serves as a defense mechanism against deeper unhappiness (hurt or sadness)
- The child uses aggression to fend off these intolerable feelings

### 2. Why Punishment Doesn't Work
- Punishment teaches that use of force is acceptable
- Talking alone has limited effectiveness because the child lacks internal emotional regulation capacity
- Children develop self-regulation through limits combined with love and understanding

### 3. The Developmental Task
- One of the most critical tasks of childhood is learning to tolerate everyday disappointments without moving into reactive anger
- Small children's happiness depends on getting what they want; losses feel like "the end of the world"
- Children must gradually internalize the ability to weather disappointment
- The goal is "unshakeable internal happiness" - resilience when bad things happen

## Recommended Approach

### Setting Firm Limits (Non-Punitively)
- Zero tolerance policy toward hitting
- Remove yourself from range when hitting occurs
- If child follows and hits, hold hands gently but firmly
- Do NOT banish child until they control themselves (won't teach the needed lesson)
- Communicate understanding while maintaining the limit

**Example Language**:
> "I know you are really angry, and you wish you could get what you want right now. I'm sorry, but you can't have that. Hitting is never ok, no matter how upset you are. It's ok to show me how mad you are by punching the pillow, or by making a mad drawing, or by pounding the playdough. But if you hit me I will need to move away from you, or hold you so you can't hit. It's my job as the parent to keep everyone safe."

### Getting Under the Anger
- Help child access the vulnerable feelings beneath the anger
- Acknowledge sadness and disappointment, not just anger
- Once vulnerability is recognized, child may pause anger and show tears
- Support crying as emotional release

**Example Language**:
> "I hear you are so angry that you can't have that, so angry you want to hit. I wonder if you are also sad. You really wanted that. You feel so sad and disappointed that you can't have that."

> "I wonder if you are so sad it makes you want to cry. That's ok. Everyone feels that way sometimes. We all need to be held so we can cry sometimes."

### Expected Outcome
- Child likely needs to do serious crying with parental support
- Pent-up feelings covered by anger need release
- After crying, a different child emerges because feelings are no longer bottled up
