- **Author**: Dr. Laura Markham

## Context
A parent describes their 5-year-old son who becomes very emotional during soccer games, having multiple crying meltdowns when things don't go as expected (missing kicks, balls going out of bounds, missing goals). The child stops playing and stands crying instead of continuing to try.

## Key Insights

### Understanding the Behavior
- The child is described as a "sensitive boy with big feelings"
- The emotional reactions during sports suggest accumulated feelings that need an outlet
- Disappointment and frustration during activities trigger emotional overflow

### Recommended Strategies

1. **Proactive Emotional Release**
   - Allow opportunities for the child to cry and release feelings at other times (at home, not during activities)
   - Set kind, reasonable limits and support the child through emotional expression
   - This prevents feelings from building up and overwhelming the child during activities

2. **Laughter as Therapy**
   - Daily roughhousing to get the child laughing
   - Builds physical confidence
   - Provides emotional release in a positive way

3. **Playful Parenting Approach**
   - Use play therapeutically to help children work through issues
   - Builds inner resources and resilience
   - Recommended resource: "Playful Parenting" by Larry Cohen

## Practical Applications

- **Before sports activities**: Ensure the child has had opportunities for emotional expression and physical play
- **Daily practice**: Incorporate roughhousing and laughter-inducing play
- **At home**: Welcome emotional expression with supportive presence during limit-setting moments
- **Long-term**: Read and apply techniques from "Playful Parenting" by Larry Cohen

## Key Takeaway
Sensitive children who have frequent emotional outbursts during activities often need more opportunities for emotional release at other times. Proactive emotional support at home, combined with daily laughter and physical play, can help build the inner resources needed to handle frustration during sports and other activities.
