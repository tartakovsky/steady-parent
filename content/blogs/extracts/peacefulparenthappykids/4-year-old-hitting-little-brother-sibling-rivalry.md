# Handling Sibling Aggression: When an Older Child Hits a Younger Sibling

## The Core Problem and Why It Emerges

Sibling rivalry and aggression often surprise parents because it does not begin with the baby's birth. **The crisis point typically arrives when the younger child starts walking and talking** - when they become a "real person" who can interact, compete for attention, and invade the older child's space and possessions. A baby who sits passively is not threatening; a toddler who can grab toys, get into spaces, and demand parental attention is.

This pattern is rooted in a primal human truth: **all humans want the love they share with a loved one to be exclusive**. This is not unique to children - it drives romantic jealousy, the Oedipal stage, and is reflected in stories like Cain and Abel or Joseph and his brothers. These are fundamental human truths about competing for love and attention.

## The Critical Mindset Shift: Understanding What the Anger Represents

When a child says something like "I'm not going to stop hitting D until he is dead" or "I'm never going to play with him," parents must recognize what lies beneath this anger. **Anger is a defense against a more threatening feeling** - specifically, the fear that the child must not be good enough or the parents wouldn't have wanted a new baby. The child is not merely angry; they are devastated and questioning their own worth and place in the family.

**The "second wife" analogy** illuminates this powerfully: Imagine a man brings home a second wife and tells his first wife he loves her so much he wanted another. He expects the first wife to love the second wife, take care of her, and show her the ropes. This is precisely how older children often experience a sibling's arrival. Why should they share the parents' excitement over these "trespassers"? Why shouldn't they be heartbroken? Why shouldn't they want to send the baby back or flush them down the toilet?

Understanding this does not betray love for the younger child - it allows parents to respond to the older child's genuine emotional crisis rather than just their surface behavior.

## The 7-Step Framework for Responding When Hitting Occurs

**Step 1: First, calm yourself**

Approach your children with as much love and peace as possible. The parent brings the emotional tone into the situation - arriving with peace immediately shifts the dynamic. If the parent arrives with anger, it escalates rather than de-escalates.

**Step 2: Acknowledge each child's position with empathy**

Both children need to feel understood so they can start to calm down. Examples:
- "O, you're mad that you think D threw your book?"
- "D, you're hurting. Ouch!"

If the injured child is really hurt, comfort them **without making the other child wrong**. Taking the injured child to tend to wounds (like going to the bathroom) serves a dual purpose: it provides care AND naturally shows the aggressor that hitting just gives the victim more attention. But do not go overboard - the goal is not to make anyone wrong.

**Step 3: Model self-calming behavior while letting each child tell their side**

Say something like: "Let's all take a deep breath and calm down. Now, help me understand what happened."

Listen to each child without judging who's right or who started it. **Restate what they tell you so they can see what they brought to the situation**:
- "So O, you thought D was throwing your book and you got mad?"
- "D, you didn't mean to throw the book? You were giving O the book and accidentally dropped it? And then O hit you and it hurt?"

**Step 4: Show appreciation for the difficulty of the problem and model empathy for both sides**

Validate that managing emotions is genuinely hard:
- "It's hard when you get mad to control yourself."
- "It hurts when you get hit. And it hurts to be misunderstood."

**Step 5: Set limits that apply universally to everyone in the house**

Even if one child is a baby and clearly not responsible, state house standards that apply to all:
- "We don't hit in this house, no matter how mad we are."

**Why universal rules matter:** If rules only apply to the older child, they develop a chip on their shoulder from perceiving that parents always prefer the younger child. This creates a bully. Universal rules prevent creating permanent "bad guy" and "victim" roles that children will carry into other relationships.

**Step 6: Model how to brainstorm alternative solutions that are win-win**

Help children evaluate solutions by wondering aloud about their effects:
- "What else could you do when you're mad, besides hit, so that everyone is happy?"
- "Well, you're right, you could hit, but we don't hit in this house."
- "Yes, you could yell at your brother. I wonder how that would make him feel."
- "I wonder if you could check with your brother to see if he really meant to throw the book? That would help you not even get mad, when you realized that he dropped it accidentally."
- "I wonder if you could call me for help."
- "I wonder if you could hit the pillow instead."
- "I wonder if you could count to ten when you get mad, and maybe by the time you got to ten you wouldn't be so mad and you could use your words to tell your brother how you feel."

**Step 7: As children get older, step out and let them resolve conflicts themselves**

- "You two are such good problem solvers. I know that if you work together you can come up with a solution that makes everybody happy. I'll be right here folding the laundry if you need me."

## The Role-Casting Trap to Avoid

**Critical warning:** If you make the older child into the "bad guy" and the younger child into the "victim," you are setting up permanent roles that they will have a hard time escaping. These roles will follow them into other relationships outside the family. Always protect BOTH children. Even when one is much younger and clearly in the right, talk to both children so they both participate in the solution.

Additional warning: You do not want the younger child to grow up secretly starting fights to have the parent prove they love them more. Address both children with solutions that do not blame anyone: "It looks like you two kids are having a hard time getting along right now. Maybe you should play in separate rooms."

## Handling Rough-and-Tumble Play and Wrestling

Boys will wrestle. The older child wrestles with the younger both because they like rough-and-tumble play AND because they want to hurt the sibling - both motivations coexist. The key rule is:

**The house rule must be that "STOP" or "NO" expressed by either party must be immediately honored.**

Punishment never helps reinforce this limit. Instead, physically separate them by saying: "I heard someone say STOP. That means now we stop. I know it's hard to calm down. If either of you wants to keep wrestling, you can wrestle the pillows on the couch."

**Practical tip:** Punching bags work wonders in these situations. The child can pummel it as long and hard as they want, providing a physical outlet for aggression.

## The Double Standard Problem with Age-Based Expectations

Parents naturally think: "If the 2-year-old hits, it's because they don't know any better. But if the 4-year-old hits, they should know better." The 4-year-old perceives this double standard immediately and knows the same expectations do not apply to both.

**The solution:** Rules must be universal for all children in the house. This principle comes from **Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish's book "Siblings Without Rivalry"** - a recommended resource on this topic.

## Seven Strategies to Alleviate Sibling Rivalry

**Strategy 1: Honor the older child's feelings**

Do not dismiss or minimize them. The child's devastation about sharing parents is real and valid. Acknowledging it does not mean you love the younger child less.

**Strategy 2: Go underneath the anger to address the feelings motivating it**

If the child can put feelings into words and be heard and understood, they have less need to act them out. When a child says "I'm not going to stop hitting D until he is dead," acknowledge the anger AND what is underneath it:

"Sometimes you are so angry at D that you just want to hit him and make him go away forever. It's hard to have a little brother. You wish sometimes that he would just be gone. You wish sometimes that you could have Mommy and Daddy all to yourself. You want to be our only boy. Is that right?"

**Strategy 3: Make each child feel adored for being the unique person they are**

Reinforce all the wonderful things about who the child is and how they contribute to the family. Generic praise is less effective than **specific contributions**:
- "I love the way you help me"
- "I love the way you make me laugh"

These help the child develop a sense of why they are still a valuable family member. Talk often about how each family member is important in their own way and makes their own special contribution - the family needs each person to be whole.

**A powerful framing:** "You ARE our only O. There is only one O in the world, and that's you. And Daddy and I are so lucky we get to be your mom and Dad. We love you so much. You know why? Because you're O. You're so much fun. You have a huge imagination. We love the way you talk to us, and all your ideas. We love D too, because he's D - but he isn't O. We love you because you're O, so you are very, very special to us."

**Strategy 4: Let the older child feel how rewarding it is to nurture the younger one**

Give opportunities that highlight the older child's special relationship: "D is sad because he fell. You're the best at cheering him up because he loves you so much. Want to try?"

This transforms the older child's role from competitor to valued family member with a unique contribution.

**Strategy 5: Whenever possible, make them a team**

Make it kids against grownups and let them win. **Using an outside foe to unite a conflicted group is a time-honored tradition because it is so effective.** This shifts the dynamic from competition to collaboration.

**Strategy 6: Make sure each child has "protected" toys**

You can have a family toy box, but children also need things that belong exclusively to them that they can feel territorial about. **If they do not have protected possessions, they will assert control over everything.** Having designated personal items reduces the need for constant territorial behavior.

**Strategy 7: Create a storyline through a personalized book**

Make a little book by gluing photos onto construction paper with printed captions. Laminate it because it will get heavy use.

**Structure of the book:**
1. Start with photos of the house, parents, and grandparents
2. Show the older child as a baby and how much everyone loves them
3. Show them getting older and being doted on by both parents
4. Show the younger child being born, with everyone including the older child doting on them
5. Show the older child alone - not necessarily unhappy, but playing alone, or a parent caring for the baby. Caption: "Sometimes O doesn't like it when Mom and Dad are busy with D. New babies can't do much for themselves."
6. **Many photos** of the brothers having fun together:
   - Older child making younger child laugh: "No one can cheer D up like O"
   - Younger child following/watching older child: "D thinks his big brother is wonderful"
   - Playing together: "Brothers love to have fun together"
7. Photos of each one being mad: "Sometimes O gets pretty mad at D. Sometimes D gets pretty mad at O. Sometimes brothers fight. But they'll always be brothers and love each other. They know you can be mad at someone and love them at the same time."
8. Photos of each child with each parent separately: "Mommy LOVES O"... "Mommy LOVES D"... "Daddy LOVES O"... "Daddy LOVES D"
9. Photo of the whole family with brothers relating nicely: "No one's more fun than a brother! We love our family."

**Why present tense works best:** Captions in present tense create a sense of ongoing reality rather than past history.

## Long-Term Outlook

Sibling rivalry never completely goes away throughout life, but siblings can become very close and turn it into a joke. By adolescence it will transform into teasing rather than physical aggression.

Parents should always set standards for kind behavior. Children will find it rewarding to be kind to each other and will do it more and more. The author notes that their own children, now 14 and 18, have not fought in years.

**Key distinction in approach:** Families where parents consciously work to meet each child's needs and help kids develop skills to get along - rather than just using force to enforce temporary truces - produce siblings who become close. The work-intensive approach of addressing underlying feelings and teaching conflict resolution skills pays off in lasting sibling relationships.

## Prevention: The Best Intervention

The primary goal is to prevent hitting by:
1. Helping resolve conflicts as you see them brewing
2. Working to keep children rested so they have a longer fuse

Prevention is always preferable, but impossible to achieve 100% of the time with two children.

## The Reassurance for Parents

Most parents have more than one child and muddle through successfully. Most siblings develop good relationships. Seeing your beloved child hit your defenseless little one triggers protective instincts and is very upsetting - it is normal to feel the urge to sweep in and knock the aggressor out of the way. This is the primal response that parents must learn to override with the more constructive approach outlined above.
