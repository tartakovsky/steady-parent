Childhood panic attacks and anxiety management for a 9-year-old

## Key Information

### Symptoms of Childhood Panic Attacks
- Dizziness
- Stomach discomfort
- Rapid heartbeat
- Shortness of breath
- Crying and feeling petrified in social situations
- Fear of becoming sick (which creates a cycle of anxiety)

### Triggers
- Group settings and social situations (school concerts, birthday parties, Girl Guides)

### Recommended Approaches

1. **Breathing exercises**: Help the child slow down their breathing during episodes
2. **Identify worry triggers**: Help children notice the worries that trigger panic symptoms so they can prevent and interrupt attacks
3. **Emotional support**: Provide love and presence during difficult moments
4. **EFT tapping**: Teach tapping on acupuncture meridians to promote calm

### Recommended Resources
- Book: "Freeing Your Child from Anxiety" by Tamar Chansky
- EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) for children

### Professional Help Guidance
- Seek professional support from a clinician experienced in panic disorders if home interventions don't improve the situation quickly
- Treatment typically should not require medication
- Treatment duration is usually only a few months
- Don't delay getting help to avoid compromising important developmental years

## Parenting Insight
The anxiety cycle can be self-reinforcing: fear of becoming sick leads to anxiety, which causes physical symptoms, which reinforces the fear. Breaking this cycle requires teaching children to recognize and manage their worry triggers before they escalate into full panic attacks.
