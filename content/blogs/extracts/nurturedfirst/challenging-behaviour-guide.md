## Core Philosophy: Behaviour as Communication

**Foundational reframe**: A child engaging in challenging behaviours is not "bad." The behaviour is communicating an unmet need. Understanding this shifts the parent from asking "How do I stop this?" to "What is my child trying to tell me?"

**Common parental misinterpretations of challenging behaviour**:
- "Why can't they just behave?"
- "This behaviour is disrespectful!"
- "How do I make this bad behaviour stop?"

These reactions stem from a learned framework that behavior determines whether a child is good or bad. This framework is counterproductive.

**The path to long-lasting change**: Get curious about what need the behavior is attempting to meet, then address that root cause. Short-term solutions (punishment, threats, yelling) fail because they do not address the underlying need.

## The SEATS Framework: Five Categories of Unmet Needs

All challenging behaviours typically communicate one or more of these five needs:

1. **S**ensory
2. **E**scaping
3. **A**ttention/Connection
4. **T**angible Item or Activity
5. **S**tability

Understanding which need(s) drive a behaviour allows parents to proactively meet those needs before the behaviour occurs, creating genuine long-term change.

## Need #1: Sensory Needs

**Definition**: An individual's requirement for sensory input to regulate emotions and improve functioning. This draws on all five senses: sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell.

**Individual variation**: Sensory needs differ from person to person. Some individuals have heightened sensitivity (needing less input), while others have reduced sensitivity (needing more input).

### Sensory-Seeking Behaviours

**What it means**: The child's body is craving MORE sensory stimulation. Movements help regulate the nervous system.

**Diagnostic questions to identify sensory-seeking**:
- Does the behaviour happen after long periods of sitting?
- Does the behaviour happen after extended time indoors?
- Does the behaviour happen after screen use?

**How sensory-seeking manifests as whining**:
- Begging to go on rides at a fair
- Pleading to go to the park even in rain
- Getting restless in the car, repeatedly asking "Are we there yet?"

**Key insight**: Whining can be the child's way of communicating that sitting still, waiting in line, being quiet, or staying indoors feels physically uncomfortable for their body.

**How sensory-seeking manifests as aggression**:
- Hitting, pushing, shoving, or biting other children
- Slamming doors or cupboards
- Kicking or throwing toys

**Age range**: Applies to children from age 2 through age 12 and beyond. Sensory-seeking children often regulate their nervous system through movement. When denied ample movement opportunities, they resort to less effective (more disruptive) behaviours.

**How sensory-seeking manifests as lying**:
A child might lie about not having homework so they can play outside with friends. The lie serves to access the sensory input their body craves.

### Sensory-Avoiding Behaviours

**What it means**: The child is receiving TOO MUCH sensory input and needs relief from overstimulation.

**Diagnostic questions to identify sensory-avoiding**:
- Does the behaviour happen when the child is hungry, tired, or in pain?
- Does the behaviour happen before meals, while fighting a cold, or during teething?
- Does the behaviour happen in cluttered, busy, noisy, or brightly lit environments (shopping malls, grocery stores)?

**How sensory-avoiding manifests as aggression**:
Hitting, biting, throwing, or kicking when overwhelmed by environmental stimuli.

**Illustrative example with dual interpretation**:
An 8-year-old slams their bedroom door upon arriving home from school.

- **Option 1 (Sensory-seeking)**: The door-slamming signals their body needs MORE sensory input to regulate after sitting on a bus and at a desk all day.
- **Option 2 (Sensory-avoidant)**: The door-slamming signals they are overstimulated and need LESS sensory input after a noisy bus ride and busy classroom.

**How sensory-avoiding manifests as lying**:
A sensory-avoiding child asked to play outside might lie and say they have homework. The lie provides the sensory break they need.

**Critical takeaway**: The same behaviour (hitting, door-slamming, lying) can stem from opposite sensory needs. Curiosity is essential to determine which applies.

## Need #2: Escape

**Definition**: The child's behaviour signals a need to escape an undesired activity or interaction. This occurs when children feel bored, uncomfortable, overwhelmed, or frightened.

**Illustrative example**: A preschooler repeatedly leaves their room at night, defying rules about staying in bed, and lying about needing the bathroom.

**Surface-level (incorrect) interpretations**:
- An attempt to stay up later
- Blatant disrespect
- Manipulation

**Deeper (accurate) interpretation**: The child is struggling with a big feeling (such as fear of the dark). Leaving the room helps them escape to somewhere that feels safe. Lying about needing the bathroom brings them closer to their caregiver.

**Common escape-driven behaviours**:
- Whining
- Running away from the parent
- Covering eyes or ears
- Engaging in behaviours they know will get them removed from the environment (e.g., screaming in a store)
- Refusing to answer questions or saying "NO!"
- Lying about needing the bathroom

**Key pattern indicator**: A child who continues to act out no matter how often punished may be struggling to communicate their need to escape. Punishment fails because it does not address the escape need.

**Proactive solution path**: Discover the escape need through curiosity, then create solutions that help the child before the behaviour occurs.

## Need #3: Attention/Connection

### Reframing "Attention-Seeking"

**Common mistake**: Caregivers view attention-seeking behaviours as negative reflections of the child's character.

**Accurate understanding**: These behaviours are not bad, wrong, manipulative, or negative. They are normal, healthy, and vital to survival. Children's brains are wired for closeness and connection with caregivers.

**Language shift**: Replace "attention-seeking" with **"connection-seeking."** The child does whatever necessary to be noticed because connection is a fundamental need. If they lack helpful and effective methods, challenging behaviours emerge.

**When connection-seeking behaviours appear**: Examine the relationship. Ask: Why might the child be seeking more connection?

### Aggressive Behaviours Driven by Connection Needs

**Mechanism**: Kids behave aggressively to get attention because the behaviour brings the caregiver closer to them.

**Age-specific manifestations**:

- **Toddlers**: Hit siblings, throw food off high chairs, throw toys (because it elicits a reaction)
- **Preschoolers**: Kick, spit, bite, push, or scream to be seen
- **School-aged children**: Shout "I HATE YOU!" or scream swear words to be heard

**Internal logic from the child's perspective**:
- "When I hit my baby sister, you finally spend time with me."
- "When I throw my toys, you notice me."
- "When I swear, I get your attention; you hear me."

**Perspective shift**: View these behaviours as the child communicating a need for connection.

### Lying Driven by Connection Needs

Children of all ages use lying to meet needs for closeness, connection, and attention.

**Example 1**: 10-year-old Keisha lies about being sick to stay home from school. She knows a parent must stay home, giving her exclusive one-on-one time while siblings are at school.

**Example 2**: 7-year-old Wesley lies about cleaning his room because completing the task means running errands with dad. He loves the truck rides, music, and silliness together.

### Critical Response Strategy for Connection-Driven Lying

**Anti-pattern**: "Catching" kids in a lie and giving a big reaction. Big reactions reinforce the behaviour because the child's need for attention gets met through the reaction.

**Recommended approach**: Get curious about the behaviour.

**Example curiosity-based responses**:
- "On the one hand, you told me you couldn't go to school because you were feeling sick, while on the other hand, you're saying you want to go to your hockey game tonight. Can you help me understand how both of these things can be true?"
- "Hmm. I'm hearing you say your room is clean, but you've only been in there for five minutes, and it usually takes you half an hour. I wonder if you're telling me it's clean because you're excited to go for a drive together, does that sound true?"

**The most important element**: Signal through language, tone of voice, and posture that the child will not get in trouble for telling the truth. Truth-telling must feel safer than lying.

## Need #4: Accessing a Tangible Item or Activity

**Definition**: The child's behaviour results from wanting something they cannot have.

**Resulting behaviours when access is denied**: Kicking, hitting, whining, screaming, swearing.

**Diagnostic questions**:
- Does the behaviour happen when they cannot have something they want?
- Does the behaviour happen when a sibling has something they want?
- Does the behaviour happen when told to take turns with a toy or that it is time to leave?

**Note**: Sometimes the desired "tangible" is an activity rather than an item (e.g., going to the park). The child may lack other communication tools, leading to kicking, screaming, or hitting.

**Lying in service of tangible access**: A child might lie about not having had a cookie yet (when they did) because lying is one tool available to access the desired item.

**Pattern recognition and proactive solutions**:
Through curiosity and observation, notice triggers. Example: A preschooler whines about everything when the parent starts feeding the baby. Solution: Give the preschooler a snack BEFORE feeding the baby, meeting their need in advance.

## Need #5: Stability

**Core principle**: Children of all ages thrive in predictable environments. When the environment becomes unpredictable, effective behaviour becomes more difficult.

**Behaviour during instability**: Increased whining, lying, and aggressive behaviours can signal the child's desire or need for stability during change or life transitions.

### Lying as a Stability Response

During major life transitions, children may lie more frequently. This allows them to control the narrative, regaining some power lost during the upheaval.

**Example**: A child whose parents are separating, when asked "Why isn't your dad around?", might lie to friends: "He's on a work trip." This makes an uncertain situation feel more stable.

### Aggression as a Stability Response

Some children need to feel a sense of control. Aggressive behaviours help them feel powerful.

**Example**: A child who recently moved might refuse to attend a new school and kick, scream, or swear at drop-off. These behaviours signal the child is attempting to be powerful in an otherwise powerless situation.

### Life Changes That Can Trigger Stability-Seeking Behaviours

If noticing the onset of aggressive behaviours, lying, whining, or defiance, consider whether any major changes have occurred:
- Moving to a new home
- Switching schools
- Adding a new baby to the family
- Separation or divorce

## Practical Method: Tracking Behaviour to Find Root Causes

**Challenge**: Root causes can be tricky to identify because:
1. The same child's behaviour might change depending on which need they are trying to meet
2. The behaviour might stay the same while the underlying need changes

### Step 1: Ask Questions

Two key questions when investigating behaviour:
- What happened BEFORE the behaviour occurred?
- What happened AFTER the behaviour occurred?

### Step 2: Take Notes

Write down answers and observations. This documentation reveals patterns and trends. Once a pattern is identified, changes can be implemented proactively.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Punishment, threats, or yelling**: These are short-term solutions that do not address root causes and fail to create lasting change.

2. **Labeling behaviour as "attention-seeking" with negative connotation**: This misframes a survival-driven need for connection as a character flaw.

3. **"Catching" children in lies with big reactions**: Dramatic responses to lying reinforce the behaviour by meeting the child's attention need through the reaction itself.

4. **Assuming the same behaviour always has the same cause**: Door-slamming, hitting, or lying can stem from opposite needs (sensory-seeking vs. sensory-avoiding, escape vs. connection).

5. **Responding without curiosity**: Reacting to surface behaviour without investigating the underlying need perpetuates cycles of challenging behaviour.

---

## Key Conceptual Chains

### Behaviour to Understanding to Solution
Challenging behaviour -> Curiosity about need -> Identification of root cause -> Proactive meeting of need -> Reduction of challenging behaviour

### The Lying Response Chain
Child lies -> Parent catches lie with big reaction -> Child's attention need is met through reaction -> Lying behaviour is reinforced -> Lying increases

**Alternative chain**:
Child lies -> Parent responds with curiosity (no punishment threat) -> Child feels safe telling truth -> Connection need met through genuine interaction -> Honesty increases

### The Stability-Control Chain
Life change occurs -> Child experiences loss of power/predictability -> Child uses behaviour to regain control (lying to control narrative, aggression to feel powerful) -> Understanding this allows parent to provide stability through other means

---

## Summary of Behaviour Interpretations by Type

### Hitting/Kicking/Biting/Throwing
May indicate:
- Sensory-seeking (need for movement/input)
- Sensory-avoiding (overstimulation)
- Connection-seeking (gets parent's attention)
- Tangible access (frustrated about not getting something)
- Stability-seeking (feeling powerless during change)

### Whining
May indicate:
- Sensory-seeking (physical discomfort from stillness/confinement)
- Escape (wanting to leave a situation)
- Tangible access (wanting something they cannot have)
- Stability-seeking (response to life changes)

### Lying
May indicate:
- Sensory-seeking (to access activities providing sensory input)
- Sensory-avoiding (to escape overwhelming situations)
- Escape (to get out of frightening situations like dark bedrooms)
- Connection-seeking (to secure one-on-one time with caregiver)
- Tangible access (to obtain desired items/activities)
- Stability-seeking (to control narrative during uncertain times)

### Door-Slamming/Screaming/Defiance
May indicate:
- Sensory-seeking (need for input after passive periods)
- Sensory-avoiding (need for relief from overstimulation)
- Escape (removed from environment via getting kicked out)
- Stability-seeking (asserting control during transitions)

## Final Principles

1. **Behaviour is communication**: The child is intelligent and capable of getting their needs met; challenging behaviours are simply ineffective methods of communication.

2. **Children are not "bad"**: Replace moral judgments with curiosity about unmet needs.

3. **Understanding "why" changes everything**: When you understand why your child is hitting, biting, lying, whining, or screaming, you can shift how you see the behaviour and develop proactive strategies.

4. **Proactive beats reactive**: Meeting needs BEFORE behaviour occurs creates lasting change; reacting to behaviour after the fact only addresses symptoms.

5. **The goal is teaching**: Help children find new ways to get their needs met that will serve them well for the rest of their lives.
