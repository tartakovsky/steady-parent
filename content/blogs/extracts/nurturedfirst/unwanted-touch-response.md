## Core Purpose and Rationale

**Central Thesis:** When children are educated about their bodily rights and empowered to protect their bodies, they become less likely to be targeted or victimized by unsafe people.

**Why This Matters:**
- Children often do not know they can say no to unwanted touch
- Children fear appearing rude or upsetting adults
- Children may not feel safe disclosing uncomfortable experiences due to fear of retaliation or mockery
- Without explicit permission and education, children lack the language and confidence to assert boundaries
- Situations involving unwanted touch can escalate to become more dangerous if children are not equipped to respond

**Opening Case Study (Benny):**
- Seven-year-old highly sensitive child
- Uncle tickled him despite resistance (screaming, squirming)
- Uncle did not stop
- Benny felt uncomfortable and overwhelmed
- Benny did not know he could say no
- Benny worried about upsetting his uncle or being mocked in front of relatives
- Benny needed: (1) empowerment to say no, (2) safety to disclose to an adult, (3) validation of his discomfort

## Part 1: Establishing Body Safety Rules

### Purpose
Body safety rules outline how children can stay safe and identify people they can turn to for help. Creating a tailored plan empowers children with knowledge of what to do when feeling uncomfortable or encountering unwanted touch.

### Key Principle
**Language may need to adapt as the child grows, but core components remain constant.**

### The Five Body Safety Rules with Scripts

| Rule | Script for Child |
|------|------------------|
| **No one touches our bodies without our "yes"** | "If someone touches your body without your consent, you can say, 'No, thank you,' or walk away." |
| **It is not safe for anyone to ask us to touch their private parts** | "If anyone other than Mom, Dad, or a doctor tries to touch your private parts, you can yell, 'Stop that, right now,' run away and come tell a trusted person." |
| **In our family, we don't keep secrets** | "If someone says, 'Hey, do you want to know a secret,' you can say to them, 'No, thank you.' If they keep trying, you can walk away or plug your ears." |
| **If anyone tells us to keep a secret, we can tell our safe people** | "If anyone tells you to keep a secret, you can come to me, Dad, Grandma, Nana or Aunty Julie. We are your safe people." |
| **We will never get in trouble for telling our safe people about unwanted touch or secrets** | "If someone tries to tell you to keep something a secret and says something bad will happen if you tell, don't believe them. You can come and tell a safe person right away. You will never get in trouble for telling us the truth." |

### Implementation Recommendation
**Role-play scenarios** to give the child practice following body safety rules. This builds muscle memory and confidence for real situations when the child is not in parental care.

## Part 2: Teaching Safe vs. Unsafe Touch

### Foundational Definitions

**Safe Touch:** Touch that makes us feel cared for and comfortable
**Unsafe Touch:** Touch that is hurtful or makes us feel uncomfortable

### Age-Appropriate Explanations

**For Younger Children:**
- "Safe touch is touch that makes us feel cared for, like high-fives, fistbumps, a pat on the back, and hugs."

**For Older Children (More Specific Details):**
- "Safe touch is the kind of touch we give others permission for. If I say a hug is okay, then it is a safe touch."
- "Unsafe touch is a touch that is hurtful, makes us feel uncomfortable or is simply unwanted."
- "This is especially true if/when someone tries to touch your private parts or asks you to touch their private parts."
- "It also includes hitting, punching, slapping, biting, and kicking."

### Core Body Autonomy Message

**Start teaching from a very young age:** Children are the bosses of their own bodies and their body belongs to them.

**Script:** "Your body belongs to you! No one can touch your body without your 'yes!'"

### Critical Emphases

1. Children decide when and how someone touches them
2. This applies **even to affection from loved ones** (do not force children to hug relatives)
3. No one should ask them to keep how they have been touched a secret
4. **Role-play scenarios** to practice speaking up for body autonomy
5. Nurture the child's instinct to say no to unwanted touch, which builds confidence

## Part 3: Teaching Children How to Respond to Unwanted Touch

### Component 1: What to Say When They Do Not Want to Be Touched

**Purpose:** Equip children with language and scripts to assert themselves confidently in uncomfortable situations.

**Key Principle:** Having simple, direct phrases prepared ahead of time helps children know exactly what to say if someone tries to touch them without consent.

**Scripts to Practice:**
- "No, thank you; I don't want a hug right now."
- "I don't want to be touched right now."
- "I am the boss of my body."

**Implementation:** Practice these scripts repeatedly so the child becomes comfortable saying no in unsafe situations.

### Component 2: What to Say When Already Touched Without Consent

**Scripts (Simple but Direct):**
- "Please stop. I don't like that."
- "I said no. Take your hands off of me."
- "Don't touch me there."

**Physical Actions to Teach:**
- Move the other person's hands away
- Turn your face or body away from them
- Walk or run away to a safe place or safe person

### Component 3: How to Report Unsafe Touch

**Core Message:** Reporting unsafe touch will not result in punishment or judgment.

**Pedagogical Considerations:**
- This topic can feel tricky and potentially distressing for children
- Approach the subject calmly
- Be straightforward
- Be mindful of tone of voice
- Adapt scripts and censor language based on the specific child's sensitivities, temperament, and maturity levels

**Most Important Element:** Signal to the child that they are safe.

**Safety Script:** "You are safe. Mommy just wants to help you stay safe, so when I'm not around, like on the bus or at school, you can still be the boss of your body."

**Reporting Scripts:**
- "I will always be here to listen if anyone's touch makes you feel weird or uncomfortable. You can tell me, and I will help keep you safe."
- "If anyone touches you in a way you don't like, I need you to tell me, Grandma or your teacher right away. Even if they tell you to keep it a secret, you can tell me."

**Example Scenario Script:**
"Let's pretend a kid at school named Joe touches your mouth during recess. That is a private part, and it is not okay for Joe to touch you there if you didn't say he could. In this instance, you can go to the teacher and say, 'Mrs. Clarkson, Joe touched my mouth.'"

**For Younger Children:** Use toys, puppets, or stuffed animals to act out scenes where a child reports unwanted touch.

**Follow-Up Assessment:** After conversations or role-playing, ask open-ended questions to assess how the child is feeling.
- "I know this topic can feel kind of tricky. Do you have any questions?"

## How to Respond When a Child Discloses Unwanted Touch

### Why Response Matters
The way adults respond shapes:
- How the child feels about themselves
- How the child responds to unwanted touch in the future

### Response Protocol

1. **Stay calm**
2. **Listen without judgment**
3. **Reassure it is not their fault:** Make sure they know they did not do anything wrong or deserve what happened
4. **Thank them for sharing**
5. **Remind them they can always come to you**

### Ultimate Goal
The child feels safe coming to you, and together you find resources to help them through this challenging time. With compassion, patience, and the right support, families can recover and move forward in a healthy way.

### Caregiver Responsibility
If you feel concerned or uneasy about a situation your child shared, it is your role as the caregiver to report the incident to appropriate authorities. You are your child's advocate, so it is your responsibility to speak up on their behalf.

## Fostering Open Communication

### Foundational Principle
**Body safety and consent conversations should not be a one-time event but an ongoing discussion** conducted in an age-appropriate way. Regular reinforcement is essential.

### Strategies for Ongoing Discussion

**Strategy 1: Storybooks About Consent and Body Safety**
- Start at any age
- As children get older, pause periodically to ask questions and get their perspectives
- Let them find answers as a way of demonstrating their knowledge

**Recommended Books:**
- *My Body Belongs To Me!* by Larissa H. Rhone
- *Consent (for Kids!): Boundaries, Respect, and Being in Charge of YOU* by Rachel Brian
- *Teach Your Dragon Body Safety: A Story About Personal Boundaries, Appropriate and Inappropriate Touching* by Steve Herman

**Strategy 2: Share Personal Stories**
- Connect and continue conversation by sharing your own experiences
- Example: "When I was a child, my Grandmother always gave me big kisses. I didn't like to be kissed, so I turned my cheek when she tried to kiss me to tell her 'no.' Do you want to practice with me?"

**Strategy 3: Role-Play with Props**
- Use dolls or stuffed animals
- Practice what children would say and do if someone tried to touch them unsafely
- Praise them for remembering body safety rules
- Example prompt: "It looks like Baby Moo doesn't want to be tickled. What should he say to Grandpa Moo to let him know?"

## Body Safety Check-Ins

### Purpose
- Keep communication open through regular check-ins
- Especially important for children who forget experiences of unwanted touch or do not know how to bring it up
- Takes pressure off children by integrating body safety into daily routines

### Check-In Examples by Context

**Post Play-Date Check-In:**
"How was playing over at Alex's house today? Was there anything that happened that made you feel uncomfortable?"

**After-School Check-In:**
"I wonder if there was anything on the bus or at school that felt tricky?"

**After Family Gathering:**
"We saw lots of cousins at Grandma's birthday party. I noticed you were playing with your older cousins for quite a while! Did you feel like the boss of your body today?"

### Outcome
Regular check-ins show the child you are a trusted source of support. Continuing the conversation empowers children to speak up about body safety long-term.

## Summary Framework: The Complete Body Safety System

1. **Create family body safety rules** with specific scripts
2. **Teach safe vs. unsafe touch** with age-appropriate definitions and examples
3. **Role-play responses** to unwanted touch (verbal phrases and physical actions)
4. **Teach reporting** with reassurance that disclosure will not result in punishment
5. **Respond appropriately** when a child discloses (calm, nonjudgmental, validating)
6. **Foster ongoing communication** through books, personal stories, and role-play
7. **Conduct regular check-ins** integrated into daily routines

---

## Key Concepts and Terms

- **Body autonomy:** The principle that children are the bosses of their own bodies
- **Safe people:** Pre-identified trusted adults the child can report to
- **Secrets vs. surprises:** Secrets (potentially harmful, should be disclosed) are distinct from surprises (temporary, fun, will be revealed)
- **Private parts:** Body parts that require special protection and should only be touched by parents or doctors for health reasons
- **Consent:** The "yes" that must precede any touch
- **Body safety check-ins:** Regular, routine conversations about the child's bodily experiences

---

## Anti-Patterns and Warnings

1. **Do not have body safety conversations only once.** These must be ongoing.
2. **Do not force children to show affection to relatives.** This undermines body autonomy.
3. **Do not react with alarm or judgment when a child discloses.** This may prevent future disclosure.
4. **Do not allow children to believe they will get in trouble for telling.** This is a common tactic used by unsafe people.
5. **Do not use overly complex or frightening language.** Adapt to the child's sensitivities, temperament, and maturity.
6. **Do not skip role-playing.** Practice is essential for children to internalize and act on body safety principles.
7. **Do not assume children know they can say no.** This must be explicitly taught.
8. **Do not ignore concerning disclosures.** Caregivers have a responsibility to report to appropriate authorities.
