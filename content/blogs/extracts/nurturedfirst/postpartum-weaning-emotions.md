## Core Premise

Weaning a breastfed baby triggers **dramatic hormonal shifts** that can cause emotional states similar to the immediate postpartum period when milk first came in. This emotional transition often catches mothers by surprise.

## Expected Emotional and Physical Symptoms During Weaning

Mothers may experience:
- Weepiness
- Fatigue
- Anxiety
- Baby blues recurrence

**Key insight:** These symptoms mirror early postpartum experiences due to hormonal changes, not psychological weakness.

## Factors That Determine Severity of Emotional Change

Two primary variables influence how intense the emotional shift will be:

1. **Speed of weaning:** Faster weaning causes more dramatic hormonal shifts
2. **Frequency of feeds/pumps prior to weaning:** Higher volume/frequency before weaning correlates with greater hormonal disruption

## Duration Expectation

The emotional changes should not last too long (implied: weeks rather than months when done properly).

## The 7 Recommendations for Emotional Health During Weaning

### 1. Wean Slowly Over Time

**Rationale:** Quick weaning causes very dramatic hormonal shifts that negatively impact mental wellbeing.

**Implementation:**
- Avoid "cold turkey" approach
- Wean over the course of a few weeks
- Gradually reduce number of feeds or pumping sessions
- Consult with healthcare professional to develop a comfortable plan

### 2. Have Social Support Ready

**Three functions of support network during weaning:**
- Emotional support during difficult moments
- Accountability to stay on the weaning plan
- Reminders of the reasons for weaning when resolve wavers

**Key phrase:** "You are going to need your village"

### 3. Write Down Your Why

**Anti-pattern identified:** Many women start weaning, then guilt causes them to resume breastfeeding, and this cycle repeats for months.

**Solution:** Document reasons for weaning before starting; refer back to this document throughout the process to maintain resolve against guilt.

**Causal chain:** Decision to wean leads to guilt leads to resuming breastfeeding leads to restart of weaning leads to guilt (repeat cycle for months).

### 4. Create a Weaning Plan

**Purpose of the plan:**
- Decrease anxiety by removing uncertainty
- Reduce physical risks (mastitis, clogged ducts)

**Plan components:**
- Schedule specifying number of feeds per day during gradual reduction to zero
- Coping strategies for physical discomfort
- Coping strategies for emotional difficulty

**Key concept:** Each weaning plan is "uniquely powerful" meaning it should be personalized to the individual mother's situation.

**Professional support option:** Working with professionals (like the article's authors) to develop the plan is mentioned as beneficial.

### 5. Remember: You Are a Great Mother Regardless of Feeding Method

**Core message:** Feeding method does not determine motherhood quality or attachment strength.

**Specific recommendations:**
- Repeat this affirmation repeatedly throughout the process
- Give yourself grace
- Avoid social media that triggers feelings of unworthiness
- Remember that "loved is most important" (love matters more than feeding method)

**Psychological framework:** Strong attachment with baby is achievable whether or not breastfeeding continues.

### 6. Talk About How You Are Feeling

**Rationale:** Weaning is difficult both emotionally and physically, requiring processing and support.

**Permission granted:** It is okay to grieve this transition. Grief is a legitimate and expected response.

**Processing options (hierarchical):**
- Professional counsellor
- Doctor
- Partner
- Friends (social support)

**Key insight:** Processing feelings around weaning is important; suppression is not recommended.

### 7. Cuddle Your Baby

**Core concept:** Many ways exist to feel close to baby outside of feeding.

**Reframing:** View weaning as entering a "new season of motherhood" rather than an ending.

**Alternative bonding activities:**
- Cuddling
- Reading books together
- Talking to baby about your day
- Going for walks together

**Psychological benefit:** Focusing on new connection methods helps navigate the transition and reduces sense of loss.

## Conceptual Framework Summary

### The Weaning Transition Model

1. **Biological reality:** Hormonal shifts are inevitable and cause emotional symptoms
2. **Speed matters:** Gradual transition reduces symptom severity
3. **Support is essential:** Both professional and personal networks serve specific functions
4. **Planning reduces anxiety:** Structure provides predictability and safety
5. **Identity protection:** Mother's worth is not tied to feeding method
6. **Emotional processing:** Grief is valid and should be expressed, not suppressed
7. **Relationship continuity:** Parent-child bond persists and can be strengthened through alternative means

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Cold turkey weaning (causes dramatic hormonal shifts)
- Weaning without a plan (increases anxiety, health risks)
- Weaning without documenting reasons (leads to guilt-driven cycling)
- Isolating during the process (removing support when most needed)
- Consuming social media that triggers unworthiness feelings
- Suppressing emotions rather than processing them
- Viewing weaning as loss of connection rather than transition to new connection forms

### When to Seek Professional Help

The article references connection to postpartum depression and anxiety content, implying that if weaning emotions become severe or prolonged, professional mental health support should be sought (links to separate content on postpartum mental health myths/truths).
