**Source:** Nurtured First (Jess VanderWier, MA, RP)
**Core Topic:** Understanding, identifying, and addressing postpartum depression and anxiety (PPD/PPA) by correcting common misconceptions

## Prevalence and Impact

**1 in 7 women** will experience postpartum depression or anxiety. PPD/PPA frequently goes undiagnosed and untreated, causing women to struggle in silence with feelings of isolation and overwhelm.

## Author's Personal Experience

The author (a registered psychotherapist) experienced PPD/PPA six weeks after her daughter's birth. Key symptoms included:
- Fear
- Need for perfection
- Guilt
- Comparing herself unfavorably to other mothers online
- Inability to sleep due to stress about baby's safety in crib
- Inability to control emotions
- Intense fear
- Dark cloud over motherhood

**Critical insight:** Even as a mental health professional, she did not recognize these symptoms in herself initially because she assumed they were normal parts of new motherhood.

**Outcome:** After seeking help, she built resilience and ability to cope with change. Motherhood became enjoyable and challenges felt manageable.

## The Seven Myths and Their Corrections

### Myth 1: PPD/PPA Only Occurs With Prior Mental Health History

**Fact:** While prior mental health struggles increase vulnerability, many women with no previous mental health issues develop PPD/PPA.

**Danger of this myth:** Women without mental health history feel unprepared and unsure what to do when symptoms appear.

**Actual Causes of PPD/PPA:**

**Hormonal/Physical factors:**
- Dramatic drop in progesterone and estrogen after birth
- Drastic changes in blood volume
- These contribute to fatigue and exhaustion

**Emotional factors:**
- Mixed feelings of excitement and anxiety create overwhelm
- New baby can trigger emotions from previous traumatic experiences

**Lifestyle factors:**
- Life becomes centered on caring for the child with little time for self
- **Sleep deprivation** is a major contributing factor to depression (research-supported)

### Myth 2: PPD/PPA Surfaces Only in First Few Weeks Postpartum

**Fact:** PPD/PPA can surface anytime within the first year after giving birth or adopting.

**Why delayed onset occurs:**
- First few weeks: Women feel well-supported by doctors, family, friends
- After initial weeks: Women spend more time alone with baby, leading to isolation
- Cumulative sleep deprivation builds over time
- Exhaustion, depression, and fear emerge gradually

**Action implication:** Support networks must check in with mothers far beyond the first few weeks. Ask tough questions. Help mothers access needed support.

### Myth 3: "It's Just Hormones, They Will Go Away"

**Fact:** While hormonal change is a risk factor, waiting for hormones to normalize causes prolonged suffering when treatment could provide faster relief.

**Recommended action:** Talk to a doctor who can:
- Assess whether medication would help
- Identify other contributing factors

**Key research finding:** PPD/PPA is highly treatable and can resolve quickly with correct medication and/or therapy.

### Myth 4: Depression and Anxiety Are Normal for New Mothers

**Baby Blues vs. PPD/PPA Distinction:**

**Baby blues (common, temporary):**
- Feeling overwhelmed
- Fatigue
- Crying frequently
- High stress
- **Timeline:** Resolves within 2 weeks postpartum

**PPD/PPA symptoms (require treatment):**
- Depressed mood
- Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities
- Feelings of worthlessness
- Suicidal thoughts
- Thoughts of harming the baby
- Extreme rage
- Guilt
- Need for perfection
- High levels of fear
- Irritability
- High emotional sensitivity
- Fatigue so severe getting out of bed feels impossible
- Inability to sleep even when baby sleeps
- Scary/intrusive thoughts
- Hopelessness and overwhelm
- Feeling like a horrible mother
- Perception of a huge dark cloud over parenting

**Critical threshold:** If baby blues symptoms persist beyond 2 weeks, this signals a potential PPD/PPA diagnosis.

**Severity spectrum:** Symptoms range from mild to severe. Any presence of these symptoms warrants professional consultation.

**Key statement:** PPD/PPA does not discriminate and can happen to anyone.

### Myth 5: You Will Know If You Have PPD/PPA

**Fact:** Many women do not recognize their symptoms because they assume their experience is normal motherhood.

**Structural problem:** Doctors typically ask about symptoms at the 6-week check-up, but women often:
- Quickly assure doctors everything is fine
- Redirect focus to the baby
- Dismiss their own symptoms as "just part of being a new mom"

**For supporters of someone potentially affected:**
- Gently approach them about concerns
- Ask how you can support them
- Assure them they can feel better
- Help them connect with a doctor or mental health professional as soon as possible

### Myth 6: PPD/PPA Is Permanent

**Fact:** PPD/PPA is extremely treatable. With correct medication and/or therapy, women can quickly start feeling better.

**Warning:** Without proper treatment, PPD/PPA can transform into a more long-term illness. This is why early intervention matters.

**Action required:** Reach out to loved ones and professionals for help. Sharing experiences and debunking myths encourages women to seek needed help.

### Myth 7: "I Am a Horrible Mother"

**Fact:** Almost all women with PPD/PPA have this thought at some point. It is a symptom, not reality.

**Contributing factor:** Social media and cultural pressure create unrealistic "picture perfect mother" expectations.

**Reframe:** If at the end of the day the baby is safe, fed, and loved, consider it success.

**Impact of this thought:** Clouds vision and makes motherhood seem like an insurmountable challenge.

**Action:** If this thought occurs daily, speak to a professional. Taking care of one's mental health is one of the best things a mother can do for her baby.

**Treatment benefit:** Getting treatment improves every aspect of life and helps mothers recognize they are doing the best they can.

## Core Recommendations

### For Women Experiencing Symptoms

1. Seek help immediately rather than waiting for symptoms to resolve naturally
2. Talk to a doctor about symptoms (even if you suspect "just hormones")
3. Reach out to loved ones and professionals
4. Recognize that treatment leads to faster recovery
5. Understand that caring for your mental health benefits your baby

### For Support Networks

1. Check in with mothers throughout the entire first year, not just initial weeks

### Success Criteria for New Mothers (Realistic Standard)
