## Opening Case Study

A mother was experiencing multiple daily tantrums with her toddler. She tried bribing, time-outs, and spanking, but nothing worked and these approaches did not feel right. Following advice from friends and family to ignore the tantrums, she found that ignoring made tantrums more frequent and more intense. The relationship with her daughter felt disconnected, and she felt like a failing parent.

## Common Misconceptions About Tantrums

The following beliefs are explicitly identified as **misconceptions**:

1. Tantrums are a child's way of **manipulating** a caregiver
2. Tantrums are the result of **poor parenting**
3. Tantrums can be **completely prevented**
4. Tantrums are **always attention-seeking**
5. Kids have tantrums because they are **"bad"** or **"defiant"**
6. Ignoring tantrums will make them **stop or go away**

## Three Reasons Why Ignoring Tantrums Is Ineffective

### Reason 1: Developmental Inability to Self-Regulate

**Core principle:** Toddlers do not have the neurological capacity to regulate their own emotions independently. They require a caregiver to **co-regulate** with them.

**Consequence of ignoring:** Without guidance or support during a tantrum, the child struggles to develop healthy emotional regulation strategies. The learning opportunity is lost because the child cannot learn what they are not developmentally ready to discover alone.

### Reason 2: Damage to Emotional Health and Relationship

**Impact on the child:**
- Feeling alone
- Feeling isolated
- Feeling helpless

**Impact on the relationship:** Without a caregiver's acknowledgement and validation, the child struggles to build:
- Trust
- Connection
- Security

**Long-term emotional consequences:** Consistent ignoring without providing appropriate comfort and guidance contributes to:
- Feelings of distress
- Insecurity
- Heightened frustration

### Reason 3: Failure to Address Root Causes

**Surface vs. depth problem:** Ignoring does not address the underlying needs driving the challenging behavior. The approach targets symptoms, not causes.

**Behavioral substitution pattern:** You may see less of the specific behavior you are ignoring, but other challenging behaviors might emerge in their place. This is because the unmet need remains unaddressed and will find alternative expression.

---

## The Solution: Emotion Coaching

**Definition:** An approach that involves acknowledging and validating a child's emotions while helping them understand and regulate their emotions effectively.

**Contrast with ignoring:** Rather than withdrawing attention and support, emotion coaching provides active engagement during emotional distress.

### Benefits of Emotion Coaching

1. **Strong emotional connection** between caregivers and children
2. **Emotional awareness and language** for children (gives them vocabulary)
3. **Problem-solving skills** (teaches children to find solutions)
4. **Coping abilities** (helps children learn to cope with feelings and challenging situations)
5. **Emotional resilience** (fosters long-term ability to handle adversity)

### Critical Implementation Note

**Emotion coaching is not a quick fix.** Children will need to be coached through their emotions for quite some time before change becomes visible. This is an iterative process requiring consistent practice over time.

## Three-Step Emotion Coaching Framework During Tantrums

### Step 1: Sportscasting

**Concept:** Narrate exactly what is happening to the child, describing their experience out loud.

**Purpose:** Helps the child connect the dots between what they are feeling and what they are doing. This is the first step to giving them the words to eventually describe their emotions independently.

**Analogy:** Like learning to understand Formula 1 racing by having someone narrate what is happening. After weeks and months of listening to narration, you gain the ability to describe events yourself.

**Example scripts:**

*Scenario: Conflict over a bowl*
"You really wanted the blue bowl, but your sister had it. You were upset with your sister, and you felt mad! It was hard to stay calm. You hit the bowl out of her hands. Do I have that right?"

*Scenario: Bedtime resistance*
"You really wish you didn't have to go to bed. You want to stay up late. It's tough to stop playing with your toys and go to bed."

*Scenario: Sensory overload*
"It was really loud in Aunt Mary's house. It was so loud that you started to feel like you needed to cover your ears. When that didn't work, you felt like yelling."

**Key element:** End with a verification question like "Do I have that right?" to confirm understanding and invite the child into the narrative.

### Step 2: Wait

**Core instruction:** Allow your child time and space to release all of their feelings.

**What to avoid:** Adding extra words. Instead, focus on being a calm presence.

**Physical support options:**
- Offering a hug or holding them while they release their tears
- Sitting quietly beside them
- Gently placing a pillow or cushion under their body so they do not hurt themselves

**Why waiting matters:**
- Offers the child an opportunity to **co-regulate** with you
- Builds emotional regulation skills through experience
- Teaches the child that they **can cope** with uncomfortable feelings

### Step 3: Connect

**Timing:** Once your child is calm.

**Key insight:** After having a chance to release their feelings, your child is **teachable**. This is the optimal window for learning.

**Actions during connection phase:**
- Discuss what happened
- Communicate a boundary
- Offer a **"creative yes"** (alternative solution)

**Example scripts:**

*Scenario: Difficulty waiting*
"I noticed it was hard for you to wait. Next time you can place your hand on my elbow while I'm talking, and I'll know you need me."

*Scenario: Potty accident during play*
"You were upset because you peed in your pants. You didn't want to tell me you had to go potty because you were having fun. Why don't we use a secret handshake next time so I know when you have to go pee?"

**Implementation guidance:** Tailor your approach to your child's individual needs and development. Consistency and repetition will help your child internalize the skills and strategies for managing their emotions effectively over time.

## Managing Parental Frustration

### The Caregiver's Core Job During a Tantrum

**Quote from L.R. Knost:** "When little people are overwhelmed by big emotions, it's our job to share our calm, not join their chaos."

**Mechanism of learning:** Repeated exposure to YOU being calm when your child is having a tantrum is how they learn to find their own calm.

**Acknowledgement:** This is definitely easier said than done. Tantrums can be really exhausting. Sometimes it feels easier to ignore a tantrum rather than having to be their calm for them.

### Mindset Shifts for Moving from Ignoring to Emotion Coaching

Four reframes to help maintain calm and engagement:

1. **"My child is a good child having a hard time."** (Separates identity from behavior)
2. **"I don't have to agree with my child's feelings to allow them."** (Validation does not equal endorsement)
3. **"My child isn't trying to give me a hard time; they are having a hard time."** (Reframes intent from malicious to struggling)
4. **"This is a whole human, who I love, and who needs me right now."** (Humanizes the moment and reconnects to purpose)

## Outcome of the Case Study

After implementing emotion coaching, the mother in the opening case study noticed a significant shift:

- Her daughter was still having tantrums (behavior change takes time)
- However, the mother was able to keep her cool
- Having a plan in place gave her the confidence she needed
- She could respond to outbursts more effectively
- She preserved her relationship with her daughter

## Reassurance for Struggling Parents

**Normalization:** Every parent is going to have moments where their child's tantrums are overwhelming.

**If you have ignored tantrums in the past:** You are not failing as a parent.

**Evidence of care:** The fact that you are taking the time to learn more about your child is a sign that you care.
