# Supporting New Moms: Questions That Offer Meaningful Help

Source: Nurtured First (Jess VanderWier, MA, RP)

## Core Philosophy

**New moms often suffer in silence** because well-meaning supporters ask the wrong questions. The key insight is that **specificity enables acceptance of help**, while vague or leading questions create barriers. Support should be **action-oriented and normalized**, acknowledging the difficulty of the transition without placing additional cognitive burden on the exhausted new mother.

## The 10 Supportive Questions Framework

These questions share common structural features: they are **specific**, **offer concrete assistance**, and **normalize struggle**.

### Sleep and Rest Support
1. **"Did you sleep last night? Can I watch the baby while you nap?"**
   - Combines inquiry with immediate offer
   - Removes need for mom to ask for help

### Practical Domestic Assistance
2. **"What is your favourite meal that I can make you?"**
   - Offers specific, concrete help
   - Lets mom choose while removing meal prep burden

3. **"Can I do your dishes?"**
   - Direct offer requiring only yes/no response
   - Addresses visible, stressful household task

4. **"What laundry can I do while I am here?"**
   - Assumes help will be given
   - Only asks for direction on what, not whether

### Personal Care Facilitation
5. **"Do you want me to watch the baby while you shower?"**
   - Acknowledges basic self-care often becomes impossible
   - Provides specific coverage for specific need

### Nourishment Support
6. **"What can I bring you: coffee or tea?"**
   - Provides limited choice (reduces decision fatigue)
   - Assumes bringing something, not whether to bring

7. **"Do you need anything from the grocery store?"**
   - Offers errand assistance
   - Removes need to leave house or organize delivery

### Emotional Support and Mental Health
8. **"It can be really hard transitioning to being a mom; how is that going for you?"**
   - **Normalizes difficulty** before asking
   - Opens door for honest response by acknowledging struggle is common

9. **"It is common for new moms to go through the baby blues. Have you had this at all? Can I help you with this?"**
   - **Destigmatizes postpartum emotional struggles**
   - Explicitly names "baby blues" to give permission to discuss
   - Offers help in same breath as inquiry

10. **"If you are having a hard time, do you know that you can talk to me about it?"**
    - **Creates explicit permission for vulnerability**
    - Establishes ongoing availability, not just in-the-moment offer

## Critical Insight on Responding to Struggles

When a new mom reveals she is struggling, the supporter has **two potential roles**:

1. **Presence and listening**: She may just need someone to sit with her, be present, and listen without fixing
2. **Access facilitation**: She may need help connecting to professional support

**Key instruction**: Ask the mom directly how you can best support her rather than assuming which role she needs.

## Statistical Context

**1 in 7 new moms** will struggle with a postpartum mental illness. This statistic underscores why normalizing struggle and creating open conversation is essential, not optional.

## Questions to Avoid (Anti-Patterns)

### Anti-Pattern 1: "How are you?"

**Why it fails**: This question defaults to "I'm fine" response regardless of actual state. The question is too vague and socially coded for superficial exchange.

**Underlying problem**: New moms experience worry, stress, and overwhelming feelings. The broad question lacks specific hooks that would make honest disclosure feel natural.

### Anti-Pattern 2: "Don't you love being a mom?" / "Are you enjoying every minute?"

**Why it fails**: These are **leading questions** that assume a positive answer. They communicate an expectation rather than genuine curiosity.

**Harm caused**:
- Makes mom feel isolated and alone
- Signals she cannot express struggles to this person
- Implies she cannot ask for help
- Forces her to perform happiness or feel deficient

**Critical insight**: The expectation that new moms should be elated and carefree is **harmful** because it causes women to suffer in silence during the postpartum period.

### Anti-Pattern 3: "Do you need anything?"

**Why it fails**: Despite good intentions, open-ended offers **require mental energy** that exhausted new moms do not have.

**The cognitive burden problem**: Thinking of ways someone can help requires:
- Assessing own needs
- Evaluating what the helper can/would do
- Formulating a request
- Overcoming reluctance to "impose"

**The solution**: Replace with specific offers. Let her know exactly what support you can give. This transforms acceptance from a multi-step cognitive task to a simple yes/no decision.

## Underlying Principles

### Specificity Reduces Cognitive Load
Every specific offer removes decision-making burden from the new mom. "Can I do your dishes?" is easier to accept than "Let me know if you need help."

### Normalization Creates Permission
Framing struggles as common ("many new moms struggle," "it is common to go through baby blues") gives explicit permission to be honest. Without normalization, social pressure to appear competent silences real needs.

### Action Orientation Demonstrates Commitment
Questions that include immediate action ("while I am here," "while you nap") show the support is real and available now, not hypothetical future help.

### Validation Before Inquiry
The most effective emotional check-in questions validate difficulty before asking about experience ("It can be really hard transitioning...how is that going?"). This sequence signals the supporter already accepts that struggle is legitimate.

## Key Reminder

The new mom in your life **may feel like she is the only one struggling**. Your role is to:
1. Help her feel normal by reminding her many new moms struggle
2. Communicate that help exists and is available
3. Ask how you can best support her specific situation
