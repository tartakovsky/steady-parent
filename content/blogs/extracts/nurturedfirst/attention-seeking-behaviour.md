## Core Reframe: Attention-Seeking Is Connection-Seeking

**Attention-seeking behaviour** is any behaviour that results in the child gaining access to attention that was not present before the behaviour occurred.

### The Fundamental Insight

When children seek attention, they are seeking to be **seen and heard**. Attention is a basic human need. Both adults and children crave feeling seen, heard, and appreciated by others.

### Healthy vs. Unhealthy Forms

**Healthy attention-seeking behaviours:**
- Asking if someone has time to talk
- Asking a friend to play
- Waving to a parent from across the room

**Unhealthy attention-seeking behaviours:**
- Hitting
- Biting
- Yelling
- Interrupting
- Stealing toys from siblings

## Why Traditional Discipline Fails

### The Problem with Dismissing Attention-Seeking

Attention-seeking behaviour is often dismissed and passed off. This is problematic because attention is a basic need that cannot be ignored.

### Why Punishments Reinforce the Problem

Traditional methods fail because they do not address the underlying need driving the behaviour. These methods include:
- Timeouts
- Verbal reprimands
- Spanking
- Other punishments and consequences

**Causal chain:** When a child's need for attention is unmet through positive channels, they will turn to challenging behaviours. Even if those behaviours result in negative attention (being yelled at, spanked, or punished), the child still receives attention. This **reinforces** the challenging behaviour.

### Illustrative Example: Toy Stealing

If a child gets spanked whenever they steal a toy from their sibling:
1. The child learns that stealing a toy leads to one-on-one time with mom or dad
2. The child may be craving that connection, even if it involves a spanking
3. This encourages the child to continue the behaviour because it guarantees parent interaction they would not otherwise receive

**Key insight:** Children will accept negative attention over no attention when their connection needs are unmet.

## The Three Connection-Building Strategies

### Strategy 1: Plan Time With Your Child (Enriched Attention)

**Scientific basis:** Research shows that children who have access to **enriched attention** engage in significantly less challenging, attention-seeking behaviours.

**Common parental obstacle:** Parents are often tired and have low energy by the end of the day.

**Reframe:** Enriched attention does not require hours of intensive play.

**Effective enriched attention activities:**
- Doing activities together (watching a show, reading stories, colouring, cooking)
- Checking in with them throughout the day
- Occasionally asking questions while they are playing independently

**Core principle:** Being engaged simply means being there and letting your child know that you notice them. It does not require big outings or drawn-out activities.

### Strategy 2: Notice the Behaviour You Want to See

**The attention allocation problem:** Parents often spend so much time giving power to challenging behaviour that they forget to notice positive behaviour. This is especially difficult when parents are overwhelmed and frustrated.

**The pattern to break:** When children engage in challenging behaviour, it becomes hard to notice the times they ask for attention and connection in positive ways.

**Action:** When your child engages in behaviour you want to see more of, explicitly acknowledge it.

**Example acknowledgment phrases:**
- "I noticed you waited until I was done with my phone call to ask for a snack!"
- "I love how you played quietly while I was working!"
- "Thank you for tapping me on the shoulder before you asked your question!"

### Strategy 3: Teach New Ways to Ask for Connection

**Foundational understanding:** Seeking connection is a universal human need. However, knowing **how** to ask for connection is learned through observing the world.

**Method: Modelling**

Demonstrate the behaviour you want to see by asking for your child's attention in the same way you would like them to ask you.

**Example modelling phrases:**
- "Hey buddy, I can see you are really enjoying playing with Tommy! When you are done would you be able to help me set the table?"
- "I missed you so much today! I hope we can spend some time reading some stories later tonight!"

**Key principle:** Modelling the desired behaviour is a very powerful tool for helping children learn new ways of seeking connection.

## Important Caveats and Warnings

**Not all challenging behaviours are attention-seeking.** In some cases, these behaviours may require professional support. Parents should consider other potential causes and seek expert evaluation when appropriate.

## Summary of Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Dismissing attention-seeking as manipulation | Ignores that attention is a basic human need | Reframe as connection-seeking |
| Using timeouts for attention-seeking behaviour | Reinforces behaviour by still providing attention (even negative) | Proactively provide enriched attention |
| Only responding to challenging behaviour | Trains child that challenging behaviour is the path to connection | Notice and acknowledge positive behaviour |
| Expecting children to know how to ask appropriately | Connection-seeking methods are learned, not innate | Model appropriate ways to ask for connection |
| Assuming enriched attention requires elaborate activities | Creates unsustainable expectations for tired parents | Simple presence and acknowledgment suffice |

## Conceptual Hierarchy

1. **Root cause understanding:** Children have a fundamental need for attention/connection
2. **Behaviour interpretation:** Challenging behaviour often signals unmet connection needs
3. **Intervention logic:** Meeting the need proactively eliminates the driving force behind challenging behaviour
4. **Prevention over reaction:** Building connection prevents challenging behaviour rather than punishing it after the fact
5. **Teaching over punishing:** Children need to learn appropriate ways to seek connection through modelling, not punishment
