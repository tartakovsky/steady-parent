## Core Message

Postpartum depression and postpartum anxiety (PPD/PPA) affect approximately **1 in 7 new mothers**. Despite high prevalence, only about **20% of women experiencing symptoms seek help**. The primary barrier to seeking help is **shame**. Mothers can recover with appropriate support and treatment.

## Warning Signs of PPD/PPA

### Distinguishing Normal from Concerning Symptoms

Normal postpartum experiences include feelings of overwhelm, fatigue, and mild nervousness for the first few days after birth. These become concerning when they **persist beyond a few days** after baby arrives.

### Clinical Warning Signs

**Emotional indicators:**
- Intense irritability or anger
- Persistent feelings of hopelessness
- Crying inconsolably and for no discernible reason
- Feeling inadequate or incapable as a mother

**Cognitive indicators:**
- Difficulty concentrating or focusing
- Irrational fears about harm coming to baby
- **Intrusive thoughts** about harm to baby

**Behavioral and physical indicators:**
- Sleep disruptions unrelated to baby's night waking
- Difficulty bonding with baby

### Screening Tool

Doctors commonly use the **Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale** as the primary screening measure for PPD.

## The Shame Barrier

The most significant obstacle to treatment is shame. Among women who did not seek professional support, shame was the **number one cited reason**. This creates a harmful cycle where mothers suffer in silence despite available treatments.

### Breaking the Shame Cycle

The path forward involves:
- Better screening for postpartum mood disorders
- Advocating for support resources
- Educating family doctors and OB/GYNs about available resources
- Normalizing open discussion about postpartum mental health struggles
- No mother should suffer in silence

## Preparation Strategies for Expectant Mothers

### Accept Help

**Ask for and accept help** when offered. Key principles:
- It is acceptable not to do everything alone
- When people offer to help, tell them specifically what you need
- Trust that people who offer help sincerely want to help

### Daily Outdoor Time

**Get out of the house daily**, even minimally. Walking baby to the end of the driveway and back provides:
- Break from indoor environment
- Sense of normalcy
- Mental health benefit

### Personalized Self-Care During Baby's Sleep

The conventional advice to sleep when baby sleeps misses individual variation. Better reframe: **Do something for yourself that fills your well while baby sleeps.**

Examples of restorative activities:
- Taking a hot shower
- Drinking a hot coffee
- Answering an email
- Napping (if that is what you personally need)

The key is identifying what **you** specifically need to feel like yourself.

## Treatment Approaches for PPD/PPA

### Stress Reduction Techniques

Therapeutic interventions commonly include:
- **Progressive relaxation**
- **Mindful breathing**
- **Thought stopping**

### Emotion Logging and Journaling

Journals and emotion logs serve multiple therapeutic purposes:
- Record frequency of negative and positive feelings/experiences
- Track progress over time so mother can see mood improvements
- Identify individual triggers
- Reduce overwhelm by externalizing experiences

## Key Messages for Struggling Mothers

### Validation Statements

- You are not alone
- It is okay to not be okay
- There is help available
- You do not have to do this by yourself
- You matter
- With the right help and supports, you can get through this
- You can have a wonderful experience in motherhood

### Action Steps
