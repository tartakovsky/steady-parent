# Navigating The Toddler "Mine" Stage: Effective Tips

Source: Nurtured First (Paige Shiels, November 2021)

## Core Concept: "Mine" as a Developmental Milestone

**Understanding possession** is a new cognitive skill that toddlers begin developing around age 2. When toddlers scream "mine," they are not being bad, rude, or deliberately frustrating. They are demonstrating that they have reached a developmental milestone.

### The Parallel to Other Skills

Just as parents model walking and talking, then support and encourage children through learning those skills, the same approach applies to learning possession. The skill requires:
- Modeling from parents
- Active support during the learning process
- Encouragement as children practice

### Reframing the Behavior

The "mine" stage can feel exhausting (toddlers may say "mine" 100+ times per day), but parents should remember:
- The behavior signals cognitive growth, not defiance
- It indicates the child is learning to distinguish between what belongs to them versus others
- Understanding why this behavior happens is essential for teaching new ways of behaving

## Three Strategies for Teaching Possession

### 1. Narrate the Rules

**Narration** is a powerful tool for helping children learn new skills. Parents should verbally explain possession rules repeatedly in the moment.

**Example Scripts:**
- "Yes, that is yours! You are right!" (validating correct ownership claims)
- "This toy is Tommy's. He is letting you play with it, but we have to give it back when we are done." (explaining borrowed items)
- "It's tough to wait for the truck. It's both your and your sister's toy. You need to wait until she is done to have a turn." (shared ownership with turn-taking)

**Why Narration Works:**
Repeated narration helps children internalize the concept of ownership. As they hear explanations over and over, they gradually understand possession, and the frequency of "mine" screaming decreases.

### 2. Do Not Force Sharing

**Key Distinction:** Possession and sharing are separate developmental milestones, though adults often conflate them.

**Developmental Timing:**
- Understanding possession comes first (around age 2)
- Sharing develops later as a distinct skill

**Practical Approach:**
- Trust that sharing will come with time
- Designate a few **"special toys"** that the child never has to share
- All other toys follow turn-taking rules

### 3. Remove the Power of the Toy

**Avoid These Practices:**
- Using timers to force toy handoffs
- Creating pressure to share immediately

**Why Pressure Backfires:**
Children are more likely to drop a toy and move on naturally when pressure is removed. Pressure tends to increase the toy's perceived value and leads to more challenging behaviors.

**Effective House Rule:**
Whoever has the toy first can play until they are done. Then the next person gets a turn until they are done. No artificial time limits.

## Turn-Taking as a Foundation Skill

**Turn-taking** serves as a first step toward sharing without the negative effects of forced sharing.

### Benefits of Turn-Taking
- Removes the power dynamic around toys
- Encourages independence
- Teaches patience
- Avoids the challenging behaviors that pressure creates

### Detailed Turn-Taking Example

**Scenario:** Daughter is playing with a toy that son wants.

**Process:**
1. The waiting child (son) approaches the current holder (daughter) and asks for a turn
2. If the child is not verbal, the parent can help make this request
3. The current holder (daughter) has two options:
   - Give up the toy immediately (her choice, not required)
   - Say "You can have the doll when I'm done" and continue playing
4. When daughter is ready to do something else, she hands the toy to the waiting child
5. **Edge case:** If the current holder does not give up the toy until bedtime, the waiting child gets first pick of the toy the next morning

### Why This Approach Works Better Than Timers

The daughter does not feel pressured to give up the toy. Pressure often escalates into more challenging behaviors. The natural conclusion of interest (moving on to another activity) creates a willing handoff.

### Implementation Notes
- This process takes time, practice, and patience
- The example is one way turn-taking could work; families can adapt

## Summary of Key Principles

1. **Reframe the behavior:** "Mine" is a sign of growth, not a problem behavior
2. **Model and narrate:** Explicitly teach possession rules through verbal explanation
3. **Separate milestones:** Do not conflate possession with sharing; they develop at different times
4. **Remove pressure:** Forced sharing and timers backfire by increasing challenging behaviors
5. **Teach turn-taking first:** Turn-taking builds the foundation for later sharing skills
6. **Trust development:** Children will learn sharing with time when supported appropriately

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Interpreting "mine" as rudeness or defiance
- Conflating understanding possession with ability to share
- Using timers to force toy exchanges
- Creating pressure around sharing
- Expecting immediate sharing from toddlers
- Punishing children for claiming ownership of items
