> “My oldest child used to be such a perfectionist. He wouldn’t try new things, and if he wasn’t immediately good at something, he would get so hard on himself. I realized I needed to change how I responded — focusing less on results and more on effort, and reminding him that mistakes are how we learn. Once I shifted my approach, he began to shift too. Now he’s more willing to take risks — and even laugh at himself when things don’t go perfectly.” — Josh, father of three

On the surface, a perfectionist child may look like a “high achiever.” They might insist redo assignments until they’re flawless, and make you proud at family events with their command of historical facts. But beneath that drive is usually a lot of anxiety — and over time, perfectionism can take a real toll on a child’s development and self-esteem. How exactly does perfectionism hurt kids? 
###  1. They avoid new things. 
When a child believes they must excel right away, trying something unfamiliar feels too risky. A perfectionist child may say _“I don’t want to play soccer”_ or _“I hate art class,”_ not because they dislike it, but because they’re afraid they won’t be good enough. The result? They miss out on the joy of discovery and the growth that comes from practice. 
###  2. They quit when it gets hard. 
Perfectionists would rather walk away than risk failure. A child might throw down a puzzle in frustration, abandon a piano piece halfway through, or crumple up their drawing if it isn’t perfect on the first attempt. Instead of building perseverance, they retreat from challenges — and that keeps them from developing the grit and resilience that will serve them all through life. 
###  3. Their self-esteem suffers. 
Because they constantly compare themselves to an impossible ideal, perfectionist children rarely feel “good enough.” Even small mistakes can feel like proof of failure. A child might say: 
  * _“I’m terrible at this!_ ” after missing a few math problems.
  * “ _I’m so stupid,”_ if they can’t read a word right away.
  * “ _I’ll never be good at that,”_ when they watch another child who has more experience.
Over time, this harsh self-talk erodes their confidence. Instead of celebrating progress, they see only shortcomings. 
###  4. They carry heavy stress. 
Trying to measure up to perfection — whether it’s their own standard or what they believe others expect — is exhausting. Kids may experience anxiety, headaches, stomachaches, or trouble sleeping, all fueled by the pressure they put on themselves. 
The bottom line: perfectionism doesn’t help kids succeed. It keeps them from growing, experimenting, and developing true resilience. What children really need is the freedom to make mistakes, the safety to try again, and the deep knowledge that they are lovable and valuable no matter what. 
##  How Parents Inadvertently Foster Perfectionism 
Parents never _mean_ to encourage perfectionism. In fact, many of the things we say or do are intended to build our child’s confidence. But sometimes our words or habits have the opposite effect. 
###  1. Start with empathy. 
  * “It’s so frustrating when things don’t turn out the way you wanted.”
  * “I hear how disappointed you feel. That’s such a hard feeling.”
###  2. Name perfectionism when you see it. 
  * “It sounds like your perfectionist voice is being really loud right now. That voice says you have to get everything just right, but that’s just not true.”
  * “Sometimes perfectionism tries to boss us around. But mistakes are how we learn.”
###  3. Normalize mistakes. 
  * “I make mistakes every day. Want to hear one I made this week?”
  * “Remember how many tries it took before you learned to ride your bike? That’s how learning always works.”
###  4. Reframe effort as growth. 
  * “Your brain grows stronger every time you practice.”
  * “It’s not about being perfect — it’s about being brave enough to keep trying.”
  * “When things feel hard, it just means your brain is stretching.”
###  5. Offer reassurance. 
  * “You never have to be perfect for me to love you. I love you exactly the way you are.”
When you weave these ideas into everyday conversations, your child begins to see perfectionism as just one voice in their head — and they learn to listen instead to their kinder, braver voice that knows mistakes help them grow, and they’re more than enough, exactly as they are. 
##  Everyday Prevention 
Perfectionism won’t disappear overnight, but you can protect against it with small daily practices that create emotional safety and nurture a Growth Mindset. 
###  1. Praise effort, not traits. 
Instead of: _“You’re so smart!”_ (which makes kids fear they’ll lose that label if they struggle) Try: _“You worked so hard on that problem — look how your effort paid off.”_
###  2. Celebrate persistence. 
Notice when your child keeps going, even if the result isn’t perfect: 
_“I saw you stick with that puzzle even though it was tricky. That’s real grit.”_
Tell your own stories of trial and error, and laugh at little slip-ups together. Let your child see that mistakes are expected, and that learning is always a process. 
###  4. Resist over-correcting. 
Instead of jumping in to “fix” their work, support problem-solving: _“Hmm… what do you think could make this stronger?”_ This shows trust in their ability and reduces pressure to be flawless. 
###  5. Watch your signals. 
Children notice our sighs and frowns. When you see them struggle, take a deep breath and stay calm. Replace anxious looks with encouragement: _“I know this feels hard, but I believe in you.”_
###  6. Let go of your own need to be “perfect” and have a “perfect” child. 
We all want other people to see how wonderful our kids are. But our job as parents is to encourage courage and growth instead of perfection. 
###  7. Build connection and resilience. 
  * **Special Time** : Ten minutes of undivided attention communicates unconditional love.
  * **Play and laughter** : Roughhousing and silly games loosen perfectionism’s grip and remind kids that life is about joy, not performance. One favorite is **“You’re So Brave!”** where you narrate your child’s pretend bravery with dramatic admiration: _“You dared to touch that squishy playdough even though it’s SO slimy?! That’s BRAVERY!”_
###  8. Create a family mantra. 
Simple phrases make the Growth Mindset part of your family culture: 
    * _“We try. We learn. We grow.”_
    * _“Perfect is boring — let’s be brave instead.”_
Perfectionism may look like high standards, but in reality it’s a defense — a way children protect themselves from the fear of failure or not being good enough. When parents shift the focus from outcomes to effort, normalize mistakes, and create a safe, connected environment, children learn that they don’t need to be perfect to be valued. 
Over time, kids begin to take more risks, try new things, and bounce back from disappointments. They discover that learning is a process, not a performance. And as the pressure to be flawless eases, they find more room for curiosity, creativity, laughter, and joy. 
That’s the gift of supporting children to let go of perfectionism: the freedom to live richer, happier lives — knowing they are loved exactly as they are.
