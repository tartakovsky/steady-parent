Question
Dr. Laura,   
I have 2 little girls (6 and 8). I work from home, and the girls are at home with me, while I work. For the most part, they are really good at keeping themselves busy in constructive ways.
However, there are times when they seem to run out of things to do, and they either a. get themselves in trouble or b. fight with each other.
I'm looking for some easy and not terribly messy crafts that I can keep on hand to help fill in the down time, especially now that they are out of school for the summer.
Of course, they are properly supervised, at all times. However, it would be great if the crafts could be something that they don't need my constant help with.
I'm thinking things that I can get them started on and then check back every few minutes as opposed to me standing over then and giving them step by step instruction/assistance.
Thanks in advance!   
Stephanie 
Answer
We all need resources for those times when we need our kids to play with minimal supervision and they've run out of ideas. Of course, they often just need a little refueling time with Mom and then they can exercise their own creative muscles. But if they've got a full love tank from you and just need some ideas to stimulate their thinking caps, you may need to pull down the "Boredom Buster Jar" or check the list posted on the fridge to give them some options.
This first list is craft/art projects. The second list is activities. I haven't included detailed instructions, and most of these projects are pretty simple, but you can also readily find more detail online if you want to flesh out your vision of these ideas. I encourage other moms to write in with additional ideas!
