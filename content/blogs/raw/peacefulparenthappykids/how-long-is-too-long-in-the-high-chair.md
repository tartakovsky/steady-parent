Question
How long is too long in the high chair? Why I ask this is I have been leaving my child in the high chair when I cook dinner or lunch. Is this wrong of me? I only do it so I know she is alright and she can't hurt herself. I hope that I am not leaving her in too long that it is going to hurt her in the long run. So I hope you can get back to me asap Thank you!! -- Jen

Jen-  
You don't say how old your daughter is, so I can't address the developmental impact of the high chair -- in other words, you want to be sure that she gets enough time to practice her crawling or walking. But every child is different. Some cannot stand to be in the high chair for more than five minutes, others are happy to sit and eat and play while you cook near them for an hour. Some kids love it if you give them toys, or let them fingerpaint with pudding, as long as you're nearby chatting to them while you cook. Others only want to eat in the high chair but will nibble for an hour. Listen to your daughter -- she will tell you if it is too long. If she is unhappy, she will let you know!
