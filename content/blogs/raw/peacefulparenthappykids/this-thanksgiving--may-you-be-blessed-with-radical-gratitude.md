> _"When we experience a sense of gratitude, we give ourselves a dose of mental sunshine. Suddenly the world seems brighter, and we have more options. " -- M.J. Ryan_

Why does parenting matter? 
Because whether things change for the better in our world depends on the people who are growing up every day in our families. Everything – even, perhaps, whether our planet survives – depends on how we shape the next generation or two of human beings. In a very real way, the future of the world rests on the shoulders of parents. 
As Charles Raison said, _"One generation full of deeply loving parents would change the brain of the next generation, and with that, the world."_
So as Thanksgiving approaches in the United States, thank you for your heroic work as a parent, that sometimes seems invisible but always matters. I'm honored to be part of your journey. 
Together we're illuminating the world. Not just for today, but for all the tomorrows of all of our children and their children. May you be blessed this Thanksgiving week with gratitude -- and a cornucopia of miracles, large and small.
