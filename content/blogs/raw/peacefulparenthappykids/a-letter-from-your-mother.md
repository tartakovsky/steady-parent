My Dear,   
I know I wasn't the perfect mother for you. Maybe there are no perfect mothers, but you deserved one. You were born perfect, and you deserved unconditional love and support. I apologize that I didn't know how to give you that. I hadn't gotten what I needed in childhood, you see, and I was so wounded. I know that's no excuse. I wish I had had the support and courage to change for you. I so wish I could go back now and give you the childhood you deserved.   
All those ways in which I was unable to be the mother you needed? They weren't about you. They had nothing to do with you. They were about me. I am so sorry I wasn't able to be the mother you deserved.   
I'm afraid you concluded that maybe you weren't good enough. But you were more than enough, exactly as you were. You were so beautiful, so wonderful, so alive. Any mother would have been blessed to be your mother. And you are more than enough, right now, today.   
This year for Mothers Day, please give yourself the gift of unconditional love that I wish I could have given you. There is nothing you need to do to deserve that love. It is there in your heart. You may need to get past some tears to find it, but your heart is full of love. Please bask in that love every single day for the rest of your life.   
You are a treasure. Please treasure yourself as I wish I could have treasured you. You are a jewel. Let yourself shine.   
with great love,   
Your Mother
