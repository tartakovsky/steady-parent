Question
I'm in my second trimester, and my husband is afraid to give me a foot massage because of what he heard from another parent, that I can get a clot released if he gives me a foot massage?

Answer
Anne,  
I'm a psychologist, not a medical doctor, so I can't give you medical advice. I can say that it's well known that if you suspect a blood clot (whether or not you're pregnant), you should not massage it because the clot could end up in your lungs. You can easily find a list of symptoms indicating a possible blood clot online, and if you suspect you have one, call your doctor immediately.
If you don't have a blood clot, then massage during pregnancy has many benefits, including reducing the stress on weight-bearing joints, such as the feet. I personally had weekly massages while I was pregnant with my son. But I had no reason to think I had a blood clots.
