Question
Dr. Laura.....I want to create a Family Rules or Laws or some sort of Creed for our family to follow and go to when needed, something with generic rules for life or quotes that I can print and frame and hang on my wall. Any ideas?
Answer
I love the idea of a few simple words on the wall that help everyone find their way back to the kind of family you’re building. Writing down your family "creed" or mission and hanging it somewhere in your home can inspire both adults and children--as long as you reference it often. 
And yes, as you talk with your children about choices and values, it's great to have a guiding vision to refer to, right on your wall. Quotes that inspire you, or a Family Motto, can also help motivate both children and adults to act on their values. 
Most families find, though, that a long list of ‘laws’ doesn't work. What works better is a handful of shared agreements.
Studies show that the families that are the healthiest and happiest don't actually have a lot of rules. They have simple, clear expectations for the way people treat each other, that both adults and children try to follow. The adults model these behaviors and when the kids struggle to follow them, the adults help them. 
So, for instance, "We treat each other with respect and kindness" could be part of your family creed. When one of your kids is not kind, there will be a reason; something they think excuses them from following the rule. (Maybe their sibling was unkind first, or was unintentionally inconsiderate.) So you would use this as an opportunity to help your children solve their problem, using your Kindness rule as your north star to move towards. Your rules are not to prove someone was wrong. They’re a compass you return to, together, to talk about how you aspire to treat each other.
It's also important for your children to emotionally "own" your family rules, so you'll want to involve them in deciding on your most important guidelines. When kids help write the agreements, they’re far more likely to feel proud of them—and to want to live up to them.  
It's a good idea to keep your Family Rules (you could also call them Agreements) to no more than five, so they don't feel overwhelming to your children. In deciding on your top rules, keep them global and always begin with your values. So if treating each other with compassion and kindness comes first, then the #1 Rule is "Be Kind." Phrasing in the positive ("We ask before we touch someone's body" will be more effective than saying what you don't want ("No Hitting"). 
Depending on the age of your children, your **Family Agreements** might look like this: 
_**1. We are kind.**_
_(No hurting people or things; No mean words except in the privacy of your bedroom. )_
_**2. We are respectful.**_
_(We ask before touching someone's body or possessions.)_
**_3. We tell each other the truth and always keep our promises._ **
_**4. We clean up our own messes and when we make mistakes, we repair them.**_
_We always work things out with each other._
__We all pitch in to help as a family.__
_**5. We support and uplift each other.**_
_**  
**_
###  Family Motto 
You might also decide to have a one-phrase **Family Motto** , which is a rule so important that it becomes a guiding vision for your family. You'll find yourself using it often, so that it becomes a saying in your family. Some mottos from parents on the PeacefulParentHappyKids.com Facebook page: 
  * Choose love.
  * In this house, we do loving and kindness.
  * Be brave, be kind, be respectful.
  * What will work? Team work!
  * People are more important than things.
  * Family is forever.
  * There is ALWAYS more love.
###  Family Mission Statement 
There are many examples of mission statements online. Whatever works for you is what you want; there's no right or wrong here. In fact, the process of discussing your mission statement with your family is probably more valuable than the finished product. 
Stephen Covey describes how he and his wife asked their kids a series of questions, including "What makes you want to come home?" and "What embarrasses you about our family?" Then they asked their children to each write a statement about the kind of family they wanted to live in. Then they combined everyone's most important points to come up with one family mission statement. Here's the mission statement they ended up agreeing on: 
_"The mission of our family is to create a nurturing place of faith, order, truth, love, happiness, and relaxation, and to provide opportunity for each individual to become responsibly independent, and effectively interdependent, in order to serve worthy purposes in society."_
So you could follow a process like this to come up with a Mission Statement that your entire family "owns." You might ask questions like: 
  * What are your three favorite one-word descriptions of our family?
  * What is most important to our family?
  * What do I value most about our family?
  * What kind of family do I want to live in?
Have everyone share their answers, and start combining. Make your first draft, and post it for everyone to read and think about. You don't have to do this all at once. Think about your draft and revise it in a week. Once you all agree on a version that feels good to you, print it out and post it. Have another review periodically -- does this need revision? Discuss. Revise. Shake on it. Frame it. And most of all, keep referring to it, and revising it, so this becomes a daily source of inspiration and discussion for your family. 
One day, your children won’t remember every rule you tried to enforce—but they _will_ remember what it felt like to live in your home. They’ll remember whether kindness was real, whether respect was mutual, whether mistakes were met with repair, and whether love was always bigger than conflict. 
At the end of the day, this isn’t about creating the perfect words to hang on the wall. It’s about naming what you want to come back to—especially on the hard days. Your Family Agreements are simply a shared promise: _This is how we try to treat each other here._
So write your creed, frame it if you like, and let it be your family’s gentle reminder: when things get messy, we return to our values—and we return to each other.
And when someone falls short (because we all will), that’s not failure—it’s the moment you get to practice your mission in real life: pausing, repairing, choosing love again, and finding your way back to each other. If you keep revisiting your creed together, it becomes more than décor. It becomes the feeling of home.
