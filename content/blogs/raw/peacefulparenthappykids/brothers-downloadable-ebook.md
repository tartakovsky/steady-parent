Peaceful Parent, Happy Siblings is full of ideas that will help you build a family culture that supports sibling closeness. On page 187, I mention the idea of **creating a “sibling book” to help your children see their relationship positively.** A personalized book helps your children understand that even though they may fight with their sibling, siblings always work things out.

_"Your first book,_ Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids _, is invaluable. But_**Peaceful Parent, Happy Siblings** _takes it to the next level and makes it all come alive so vividly.
