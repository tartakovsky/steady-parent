###  Day 2: Discipline Through the Lens of Safety 
Today's **Peaceful Parenting Challenge** explores how viewing your child's behavior through the lens of safety can revolutionize your approach to discipline. 
Did you know that the way we traditionally interpret signs of defiance or disconnection in our children can be misleading? These behaviors often stem from feeling unsafe or overwhelmed. 
Today's video will give you specific strategies to create safety and connection, so that you can prevent these defensive responses, promote more cooperative behaviors in stressful situations, and support your child to develop a more resilient nervous system for life!

  * Empathize and welcome all emotions
  * Facilitate more opportunities for your child to play, both with other children, and with you.
