Meditation is beneficial to reduce stress, boost immunity, increase the ability to focus, and enhance compassion in people of all ages. Meditation actually changes the brain so that the meditator has more healthy self-awareness and more ability to regulate. And meditation calms anxiety.
So it seems obvious that every child would benefit by learning to meditate. Since we can't protect our children from stressful events, it's even more important that we help them learn mindfulness skills. And the good news is that these skills will serve our kids for the rest of their lives!
* * *
Even very young children can learn how good it feels to drop into inner calm. When I was four, my favorite game was the Still Game. I would convince one of the neighbor children to sit quietly with me, shut our eyes and remain very still. I don't think any of them found this as riveting as I did, so it never lasted long. But I always had a hard time tearing myself away from that deep stillness to reconnect with my playmates and the world. The Still Game felt to me like opening a door to sunshine and peace, and started me on a life path of mindfulness practices. 
Children like to move, so they usually don't sit still for long. But all children instinctively connect to presence. I think for children to enjoy meditation, it needs to be something we model, build into the schedule regularly, do only for short periods, and begin in a way that is enticing for the child, such as with guided meditation. 
Happily, you don't need to bribe your child to sit still. There are wonderful guided meditations available now to introduce children of all ages to meditation and mindfulness, and they're interesting enough to hold kids' attention. Resources to get you started are listed at the end of this article. 
And there are now some terrific books for children (one by Thich Nhat Hanh) to introduce the idea of mindfulness, some of which I've linked to below. 
And of course, in addition to there being many ways to Meditate, there are many Mindfulness practices, from learning to notice your body in space, to learning to calm yourself, to learning to be more present. These techniques are often fun for children to learn when they're calm, and if they become a regular part of your family life, your child may even remember to use them when they're angry. 
The challenge in getting children to use these strategies for self-regulation is that when a human is angry, suggesting they calm down is like throwing gasoline on a fire. (Do you recall the last time you were really outraged about something that mattered to you? What if your partner or friend, instead of listening to you, had suggested that you take a few deep breaths to calm down?) 
So, if you approach mindfulness practices with the attitude that you're "fixing" your child's inappropriate tendency to get emotional, your child will naturally resist. 
If, instead, you make a family project out of what you might call "learning to be aware of our emotions so we can communicate in a kind way and choose our actions," your child will probably be open to the idea. If you play mindfulness games with your child, and talk about how much you're enjoying them and what you're earning, your child will also enjoy them and learn. 
If you model using mindfulness techniques when you're upset, your child will come to think of it as a normal, helpful strategy when facing challenging emotions. So be explicit: 
  * "I'm feeling upset so I'm going to take some slow deep breaths to help me calm down. 1....2....3...."
  * "I feel a little worried about this. Everyone gets worried sometimes. I can help myself feel more confident by reassuring myself that it's not an emergency. I can handle this."
Then, when your child is upset, remember that you first need to listen to their upset. Acknowledge why they're upset, and empathize. Give them a chance to calm down just from feeling heard. Only after that should you ask your child if they want to use your tools to help them feel better. 
  * "I see you're feeling upset right now. Do you want to breathe with me?"
  * "It's normal to feel worried sometimes. Is there something you could tell yourself that would be reassuring?"
Remember, you are NOT trying to make them calm down. You are recognizing that your child is in pain and listening to that pain. Only after that do you offer the support of helping them manage their mind and emotional reactions so they can feel better.
And if you take the time to enjoy a guided meditation with your child every day, you'll both enjoy it, and before you know it, your child will be asking to play the Still Game!
