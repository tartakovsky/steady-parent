As parents, we spend our days helping children learn kindness, self-control, and care for others. We work hard to create homes where children feel safe enough to grow, explore, and imagine a future. The Peace Foundation’s work reminds us that those everyday efforts depend not only on what happens inside our families, but also on the larger world our children will inherit. 
Today, thousands of nuclear weapons remain in existence, many on high alert. Their danger does not come from malicious intent alone, but from human error, miscommunication, and moments of crisis—conditions that history shows are inevitable. For parents, this isn’t an abstract political issue. It’s about protecting the possibility of a future in which our children can grow up, raise families of their own, and live on a planet not shadowed by the risk of sudden, irreversible catastrophe.

Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict. Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.”** - António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 10th Review Conference, 2022) 
"The Doomsday Clock has been around since 1947, and the time on its countdown can move backwards and forwards, depending on how optimistic or pessimistic the outlook is. **The clock is currently set at 89 seconds to midnight. It’s the closest we’ve ever been to midnight in the history of the clock.** " - Daniel Holz, University of Chicago, 2025.
