> _"Dr. Laura.....I probably say 'Good Job!" ten times a day....if that isn't a good idea, what am I supposed to say to encourage good behavior?!" - Ariana_
* * *
Like Ariana, you may be wondering how else you can give your child positive feedback. 
After all, you may have heard that it takes at least 7 positive interactions fto outweigh each negative interaction, if you want to maintain a good relationship. While hugs and smiles go a long way, you're in constant verbal interaction with your child, and your most common phrase may well be _"Good job!"_
Besides, everyone needs encouragement. And there are things you'd like him to learn about how to be in the world. How else can you guide him? 
The short answer is that our children need to feel seen and accepted and encouraged, no matter what. But praise, and especially "Good Job!" are not the best way to do that. The evaluation inherent is praise is what's problematic. No one likes to feel constantly judged. It has a dampening effect on confidence, initiative, and simply being able to take pride in one's accomplishments. 
But that doesn't mean you can't find positive ways to interact with your child, hopefully many of them, all day long. And it doesn't mean you can't help him notice the effect of his choices, so that he can make wise ones. 
In fact, your positive encouragement can be a super-power for your child. To retrain yourself, just write down a few phrases that you want to start using, and try them out. Don't be surprised if you see your child become more thoughtful, more self-motivated, and happier. 
###  Here are some examples of what you can say instead of conventional praise, and why. 
Instead of:   
_"Good sharing!"_  
Try:   
_"Wow! Look how happy your brother is to have a turn with your toy."_
Why? We all want to guide our child, and that does involve value judgments on our part. But instead of just explaining things as good and bad, take the time to help your child see his power in the world. This shows him in ways he can easily understand that his actions really do matter. Rather than telling him that he's good when he acts in accordance with a value that's important to you, point out the result. That way he can decide whether to repeat the behavior to get that good feeling inside -- rather than just to get praise from outside. 
"_What an incredible painting!"_  
_"I saw you working hard on that painting. Can you tell me about it?"_
Why? You're not expecting her to be Van Gogh at four. What you want is for her to enjoy the exploration, the process, the work -- and to go on to do more painting. Research shows that when we evaluate, children worry that their next painting won't be as good, so they stop trying. 
Aren't there value judgments inherent in your feedback? Yes. In this case what we're noticing is "hard work." But I don't think it's a problem to focus positive attention on what we value. After all, we're guiding our child all day, every day in accordance with our values. What's important is to notice what values you're actually promoting with your feedback. For instance, 
_"You played better today; you almost scored a goal."_  
_"I love to watch you play!"_
Why? The first version sounds like her playing isn't worth anything unless she scores a goal. We can't say that sports are about fun and teamwork and then push kids to be the one to score the goal. Here's an eye-opener: Kids who play sports say the worst part is the ride home in the car when parents inevitably comment on how they can improve their playing. Let the coach play that role. Your role as the parent is to enjoy your child's playing, so that she can find joy in it. 
_"You're so smart!"_  
_"You just kept trying, and you figured it out!"_
Why? Because kids who are told they're smart think that if they have to work at something, it means they aren't so smart after all. You want him to understand that the brain is like a muscle that that he can grow. Once he realizes that if he keeps working at something, he can figure it out, he has the confidence to learn and master anything. 
_"I'm so proud of you!"_  
_"You must be so proud of yourself!"_
Why? Because “I’m proud of you” puts the focus on _your_ approval, while “You must be so proud of yourself” helps your child connect with their _own_ sense of accomplishment and self-worth. When children learn to look inward—to notice what it feels like to work hard, persist, and succeed—they build genuine confidence that doesn’t depend on praise or outside validation.
Of course, it’s not wrong to tell your child you’re proud of them—every child needs to feel that love and delight reflected back from their parent. Just use it thoughtfully, and balance it with messages that remind your child that _they_ are the ultimate judge of their own effort and growth. That’s what builds a sturdy, self-sustaining sense of pride.
_"Good job!"_  
_"You did it!"_ or _"Wow! Look at you up there!"_
He needs to know you noticed that he did it, and maybe that you're impressed, if you are. But you're mirroring his excitement, not telling him what to feel. Leave the evaluation of whether it's "good" to him. 
Does that mean you can't influence your child by telling her that you like what she's doing? Of course not! Children need to know that their contributions are valued. The danger is when our child gets the message that she's only good enough if she does things our way. 
_"Big girls help Mommy."_  
_"When you help me like this, we get done so quickly--I love it! Thank you."_
Why? You're teaching your child how to have a relationship with another person. She needs to know -- without guilt trips -- that what she does has an effect on the other person, so she can choose her actions. It isn't about evaluating her as a human being. 
Remember that non-specific praise backfires. 
_"You're such an angel today."_  
_"I'm having such a good time singing with you today. I love it when we have so much fun together."_
Why? Your child knows she isn't a little angel, she's a fallible human being -- and if you forget that, she'll need to show you by acting out in the worst way she can think of. Just too much pressure! Instead, be specific about what you like, so she can see that yes, she really is doing this thing you admire, and if she wants to, she can choose to do it again. 
There is one kind of general positive feedback that always works, because it's feedback about you: 
_"You're a good boy."_  
_"I am so happy I get to be your mom. I love you so much, no matter what!"_
Telling a child they're "good" evaluates conditionally. But worse, how does the child know what to do to try to "be a "good boy" again in the future? It's so global, and applied to all kinds of different behavior. But your delight in your child, your unconditional attention and acknowledgment and approval, just for being who they are -- that's not about something they're doing but about something you feel for them that they never have to perform to get. That's something every child needs to hear often.   
###  Keep the focus on the child's internal experience: 
  * _"You must feel so good about that!"_ - acknowledges their positive feelings without inserting your judgment.
  * _"How does it feel to have figured that out?"_ - invites them to reflect on their own satisfaction and learning process.
  * _"You did that all by yourself!"_ - emphasizes their independence and capability.
  * _"Look what you're capable of!"_ - helps them recognize their own growing abilities.
  * _"You should feel really good about that choice"_ - validates their decision-making while keeping the good feeling centered in them.
  * _"That must have felt amazing when you succeeded!"_ - connects them to the natural high of achievement.
When children learn to recognize and trust their own feelings of pride and satisfaction, they become less dependent on external validation and more confident in their own judgment. This approach is so much healthier for developing intrinsic motivation; building self-reliance rather than approval-seeking. 
###  Acknowledge Instead of Praising 
**Focus on their effort and process:**_"I noticed how hard you worked on that"_ or _"You didn't give up even when it got difficult"_ helps children understand that persistence and effort matter more than just outcomes. 
**Acknowledge their specific actions:** _"You were really kind when you helped your friend"_ or _"You explained that math problem so clearly"_ shows you're paying attention to their particular strengths and choices. 
**Recognize their growth:** _"You're getting better at sharing your toys"_ or _"I can see how much your reading has improved"_ highlights their progress and development. 
**Emphasize their internal satisfaction:**_"You look really happy with how that turned out"_ or _"How do you feel about what you accomplished?"_ helps them develop intrinsic motivation rather than seeking external approval. 
**Celebrate their character:**_"That was a brave choice"_ or _"You showed real thoughtfulness"_ reinforces positive character traits. 
As Alfie Kohn says, 
_"What kids do need is unconditional support, love with no strings attached. That’s not just different from praise – it’s the opposite of praise. "Good job!" is conditional. It means we’re offering attention and acknowledgment and approval for jumping through our hoops, for doing things that please us."_
