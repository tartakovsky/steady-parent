Parenting is tough, and often we're just rushing against the clock to get our kids out the door in the morning, pick them up on time, get them through their homework and dinner, into the tub, into bed...so we can get up the next morning and do it all over again. 
* * *
But it's a truism because it's true. These years pass more quickly than we can imagine, and when your child looks back, these are the memories that will define family for them. 
Extraordinary moments often masquerade as ordinary life, and one of the best ways to stumble into extraordinary moments is to create regular family traditions.
Traditions can be an easy, meaningful way to take a breath during the rush and reconnect. They don't have to be a burden; you can simply choose a family activity to try, and then see if you want to make it into a family tradition. But try only one thing every season; life is busy enough already. Your good mood is what creates meaningful family connection, so drop the guilt and keep it simple.
In the northern hemisphere, it's Autumn. Most of us aren't celebrating the harvest. But as the dark comes earlier, we instinctively turn our focus inside, toward cooking wholesome food, lighting candles and creating a cozier home.   
Would revitalizing a seasonal autumn tradition create a more cozy connection in your home? Here are some ideas to get you started. You can pare them back and make them as simple as you want. The point is connection, not emulating influencers (who btw have staff!) As long as there's laughter and hugs, you're on the right track.
### Creative & Cozy Traditions
  * **Carve pumpkins together.**
  * **Halloween costumes**. Set aside time every weekend during October to help kids make their own. Even five year olds can help you sew a seam on the machine or glue on ears. You'll save money, have a costume good enough to reuse, and think how proud he'll be! By the time he's eight, he'll be taking charge of making his own costume. 
  * **Record a “spooky” outgoing voicemail message.** Take ten minutes with your child to have some silly fun. 
  * **Make fall crafts.** Press and iron colorful leaves in wax paper for window hangings or scrapbooks, or set up a “nature table” with acorns, pinecones, gourds, and other treasures gathered on walks. 
  * **Family Story Night.** Light a candle and take turns telling stories—family memories, ghost stories, or made-up adventures. Kids love hearing stories from when their parents were small.
### Outdoor Adventures
  * **Rake the biggest leaf pile.** Divide into teams and see who can build the tallest, then take turns leaping in. 
  * **Go apple picking.** Turn your haul into applesauce or pie. 
  * **Take a crisp autumn hike.** End with apple cider and donuts. 
  * **Lantern or Full Moon Walk.** Make paper lanterns (or use jars with LED candles) and head out for a cozy evening stroll. On a clear night, go star-gazing with blankets and cocoa.
### Food & Kitchen Rituals
  * **Bake together.** Fill your home with the smell of pumpkin bread, mulled cider, or fresh soup. If your grocer stocks frozen dough, bake bread. Or find an easy pretzel recipe to knead together. 
  * **Soup Sundays.** Pick one Sunday each month to cook a big pot of soup as a family—everyone helps chop, stir, and taste. 
  * **Pumpkin Tasting Night.** Try pumpkin bread, roasted seeds, muffins, or soup, and rate your favorites. 
### Gratitude & Giving
  * **Start a family gratitude journal.** Ask each person what they were grateful for that week. On Thanksgiving, read the entries aloud—you may be inspired to keep it going year-round. 
  * **Kindness Leaves.** Cut paper leaves and write an act of kindness each family member will do that week. Tape them to a “gratitude tree” on the wall or fridge. 
  * **Harvest Sharing.** Share your baked goods or apple-picking bounty with neighbors, friends, or grandparents.
Family rituals give us meaning, which is a basic human need. And when our human needs are met, we're happier! What traditions does your family have? What tradition might you like to try this year?
