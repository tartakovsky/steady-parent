Question
Dear Dr. Laura,  
I am 20 weeks pregnant and I am a little bit worried because I'm not feeling the baby move as much as before. I mean, the baby started moving before week 16. I just hope everything is fine or am I worrying too much?  
Antonia
Answer
Antonia,  
Please call your doctor right away and go in for a checkup. Your baby is almost certainly just fine, but there is no reason for you to be nervous. That is what doctors are for!   
Blessings to you and your baby,  
Dr. Laura
