Do you buy gifts for your child at the holidays? At birthdays? Of course! Then you'll be interested in the research that **experiences** are more meaningful gifts than material objects, including toys. In fact, most of the toys we buy for our kids, including the ones they beg for, are played with for twenty minutes upon receipt, and then abandoned. 
But there are **some** toys that kids play with over and over, through the years. Not coincidentally, these are also the toys that researchers tell us are beneficial for the child, meaning they will be good for the child's development and will sustain the child's interest over time.  
* * *
So as long as we're spending money on toys, let's explore which toys are developmentally beneficial! That means something different at each age, and includes physical, cognitive, social and emotional development. But what do scientific studies say about the kinds of toys that nurture children's development in general? 
The answer is that any toy that encourages play is good for a child's development, because play is so important. And no, most toys that are sold are not sold because they are good for the child. They're developed by toy manufacturers to provoke the child's interest so that someone will buy them! If they aren't played with after that, it doesn't matter to the toy manufacturer. 
To understand which toys encourage play, let's consider the consistent findings from the wealth of research on play. Studies repeatedly find that children thrive when they have the opportunity for play that is: 
  * **Deep** - The child has the opportunity to be immersed in the play for long periods of time.
  * **Unstructured and Self Directed** - If an adult directs the play, it is by definition not self-directed by the child. If the toy is "structured" to be used only in certain ways, then it is by definition not encouraging exploration or creativity.
  * **Imaginative** - Fantasy or "make believe" play allows children to develop their imaginations, whether that play is with others or alone. Imagination facilitates learning and is the source of all creativity and accomplishment. Fantasy play also allows children to process whatever emotional issues they are working on, so it's important for emotional development.
  * **Creative** - Play is inherently creative, if it is unstructured and self-directed. That gives children the opportunity to invent, experiment, combine things in new ways. The experience of creativity, or being "in the flow" is one of the most rewarding and stimulating experiences in healthy human development at all ages.
  * **Explorative** - Children learn when they explore, test out their ideas, solve problems, think critically, and try new things.
  * **Social** - Not all play needs to be social, because children also need time alone for exploration and creativity. But when children engage in cooperative play with others, they develop executive function skills like delayed gratification, taking turns, self-regulation, receptive and expressive language skills, and solving problems with others. They also strengthen their bond with their playmate or caregiver!
One ten-year study (the 
###  Simple: 
Toys that inspire the child to use the toy in their play, rather than entertaining the child. "For example, a simple wooden cash register in our study inspired children to engage in lots of conversations related to buying and selling—but a plastic cash register that produced sounds when buttons were pushed mostly inspired children to just push the buttons repeatedly. Similarly, a doll that does the talking for a child will generally result in play that is less imaginative than a simple doll where children have to imagine for themselves what the doll might say," said the authors of the Timpani study. 
Here's a good rule of thumb: The more the toy "does" for the child, the less it facilitates play. A babydoll that talks is limited to the phrase "Mama" or whatever. A babydoll that doesn't talk will express all kinds of things when the child plays with it. 
###  Open-ended: 
Children's play is most creative and sustained with toys that can be used in many different ways, because children actually WANT to develop their own ideas. One example would be building blocks. When my son was four, he spent every morning at nursery school in the block corner with his friends. They would build towers, then a zoo, then a pirate ship. Another example we've all observed is that kids would rather play with a plain box than the toy that came in the box, because they can project any fantasy onto the box, which can be anything from a canoe to a computer. 
###  Non-realistic: 
Toys that don't look like something in real life can be adapted to serve any fantasy play. For instance, a colorful scarf can be used to clothe a baby doll, create a dance, wrap pretend food to run away to the forest, or dress for a ball. 
###  Child-directed building, Problem-solving, Fantasy 
The holy grail of toys? The Timpani study especially recommends flexible, open-ended Construction toys such as hardwood blocks, Legos, TinkerToys, and Magna-Tiles, that encourage child-directed building and problem-solving, as well as Replica play toys such as small people, animals, or vehicles that encourage children to create elaborate, make-believe scenarios, alone or with others. 
###  Avoid recognizable characters: 
Many preschool teachers will tell you that children who mimic specific characters from screens play less creatively, because they recreate the stories they've watched instead of inventing their own. So in addition to limiting screens, it's a good idea to avoid characters from shows or movies when you select toys. 
###  Less is More: 
The final takeaway from play and toy research is that children engage in a higher quality of play when they have fewer toys. Instead of becoming overstimulated and moving from one toy to the next, they engage in deeper, more sustained and more creative play. (Here's one research study on this from 
Get into the habit of cycling toys in and out of the play area, so your child can play more deeply. Don't be afraid to buy your child a new toy for the holidays or a birthday, but don't make a habit of it otherwise, even when kids beg. More toys does not equal more play. 
As you can see, "toys" are not what allow children to "play." Play is the natural state of every child and will happen even without toys. Play is a creative process of exploration and learning that children engage in, alone or with others, that is essential to intellectual, emotional and physical development. Facilitating play opportunities with other kids, playing with your child, protecting stretches of time for deep play -- these are all much more important for your child's development than any toy.  
The bottom line? Play is what your child needs, not toys. Your child will remember experiences with you (including games you play together) more than any object, and time with you is a more meaningful expression of your love than any object. Still want to gift your child a toy? Understood! Go for the toys that will allow them to experience all the joy of real play!

Parents often ask me for recommendations for toys for their child so I have put together a [Gift Guide](https://www.peacefulparenthappykids.com/recommended/index) with my favorite items. Each one is something I personally believe in and have used myself or given as a gift.
