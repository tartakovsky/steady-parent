## Introduction

Many parents desperately ask why children hit. Whether witnessing this during playdates or experiencing it firsthand, you're not alone. Almost every kid goes through phases of hitting, kicking, and biting. While developmentally typical, these behaviors are frustrating and painful. The goal is teaching children better approaches while building lasting emotional skills.

## Why Do Kids Hit?

Children are born with all of the feelings and none of the skills to manage those feelings. Intense emotions like frustration, jealousy, disappointment, or excitement can manifest as physical aggression. The underlying issue isn't disobedience—children simply lack emotional regulation abilities yet.

A parent's job is to teach kids the emotion regulation skills they need, so their big feelings don't come out as behaviors like hitting. This perspective helps parents view challenging behavior as a skill deficit rather than character flaw.

### Why Toddlers Hit Specifically

Hitting in toddlers is developmentally appropriate as they learn emotional expression. Physical behaviors indicate fight-or-flight responses—their bodies feel overwhelmed, triggering self-protective reactions. Children aren't actually in danger; they simply experience intense emotions they cannot yet process effectively.

## Why Punishments Don't Work

Using punishment strategies actually misses critical teaching opportunities. When we use punishments or consequences for hitting, we actually miss a critical opportunity to teach our kids how to manage the underlying feeling.

Consequences can backfire: children may suppress emotions entirely (leading to future anxiety) or escalate to more dangerous behaviors like lying or sneaking out. Our job is to teach our kids the skills they need to thrive in life, instead of punishing them for not knowing yet.

## How to Stop Kids From Hitting

### 1. Keep Yourself Calm

Parental composure helps dysregulated children feel less overwhelmed. Remind yourself: "I have a good kid who is having a hard time, not a bad kid giving me a hard time."

### 2. Keep Your Child Safe

Set clear boundaries without punishment. Say, "I won't let you hit," while physically preventing contact through hand-holding or barriers.

### 3. Validate Emotions

Acknowledge underlying feelings and model healthy regulation: "You must feel really angry to hit me like that. If you have mad energy in your body, you can hit a soft toy or a pillow."

## Three Key Takeaways

- Hitting represents dysregulation, not disobedience
- Teach missing emotional regulation skills rather than punishing
- Ground yourself first—you cannot regulate dysregulated children
