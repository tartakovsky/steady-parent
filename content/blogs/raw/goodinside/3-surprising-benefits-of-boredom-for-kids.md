Picture this: You’ve barely finished your coffee, the breakfast dishes are still in the sink, and your kid is sprawled across the floor surrounded by books, toys, and games, whining: “I’m booooored!”

Handling boredom in kids is one of the most common summer parenting challenges. If you find yourself rushing to turn on a show, googling “easy summer activities,” or frantically texting friends for a last-minute playdate, you’re not alone. When your kid says ”I’m bored!”, it can feel like you’re up against parenting failure - like you’re supposed to fix something and fix it fast.

Well, we’re here to tell you: You aren’t failing. In fact, it’s healthy for kids to be bored.

At Good Inside, our mission is to help you raise confident, resilient children - and boredom plays a key part in building these skills! In this article, we’ll dive into the benefits of boredom for kids - and share our go-to strategy for parenting without constant entertainment this summer (including how to handle discomfort during unstructured time - yours and your kid’s!).

One of our core beliefs at Good Inside is that we have to understand before we intervene. So, what’s really going on when a kid says, “I’m bored!”

Boredom usually shows up when a child realizes, “Wait a second, I’m not being entertained right now!” They are missing the fast, frequent dopamine hits that so many kids are used to - especially in our digital-first world. When we jump in to fill this gap and provide that dopamine hit, we actually remove our child’s ability to tolerate the frustration of boredom and (eventually) work through it themselves.

The inconvenient truth is that our kids can only learn to tolerate feelings that we tolerate in them. When we make space for boredom - and show our kids it’s not a “bad” feeling - they will start to make space for it, too.

The big idea: Boredom isn’t a problem for parents to fix. It’s an opportunity for kids to build new skills.

So, what skills does boredom help build, exactly? Boredom is the gateway to resilience, creativity, and independence. It teaches kids how to:

Let’s be real: Boredom can feel frustrating! And that’s okay. In fact, learning how to tolerate the “blah” feeling of unplanned, open time is a crucial developmental milestone. Sitting with boredom - instead of escaping it - builds frustration tolerance. They learn, “This feels tricky and I’m a kid who can sit with tricky feelings.”

Boredom sparks creativity, storytelling, and problem-solving. Left to their own devices for long enough, and children will turn inward: Inventing imaginary creatures or building cities out of sofa cushions. That’s the value of free play vs. entertainment: Open-ended play - play without clear instructions, goals, winners, or losers - is where flexible thinking and confidence take root.

One of the most powerful benefits of boredom for kids? They learn they don’t need an adult (or a snack, or a screen) to “make it better.” Instead, they learn to sit with and navigate tricky feelings on their own. Boredom helps our kids regulate their own emotions - a life-long skill that will serve them far beyond summer.

Why does letting our kids be bored feel so hard? Well, we live in a world that tells us children need constant stimulation: summer camps, crafts, sports, pinterest-worthy parties - these are the images parents are sold. It’s no wonder summer hardly feels like a break!

During the summer, parents are usually juggling multiple (unofficial) roles: makeshift camp director, sibling referee, personal chef, chauffeur. The pressure to entertain our kids every minute and “make the most” of every day can quickly lead to burnout - and, ironically, make meaningful connection with our kids harder.

When we’re stretched thin, it’s hard to respond with patience. It’s hard to stay grounded. It’s hard to be fully present. That’s why reducing summer parenting pressure isn’t just a nice-to-have - it’s essential in order to access the version of yourself you want to be for your kid. After all, the best memories are rarely manufactured: They’re conversations in the car, snuggles before bedtime, and giggles over melting popsicles.

One of our favorite strategies to embrace boredom as part of your summer routine? The “boredom block.”

A “boredom block” is a built-in time where nothing is planned, no one is entertained, and everyone is just... being. This might sound counterintuitive, especially if your child greets every unstructured moment with “I’m boooored.” But that discomfort? That’s where growth begins.

There’s no magic formula for the boredom block - every family is different, and you know your kid best. Here are a few tips to get started and find what works for you and your kid:

- Set expectations. Tell your kid the plan: “We’re going to try something new: It’s called a “boredom block” where we don’t plan anything. I know, I know, this might sound… well, boring! And that’s okay. It will feel tricky and you’re a kid who can figure out tricky things!” This way, when boredom hits, they’re not surprised by it… and also, you’re not caught off guard by the whining.
- Start small. Consider what feels approachable for your kid based on their current schedule. You can start with a boredom block as short as 15 minutes - or as long as two hours!
- Validate the feeling, while holding your boundary. When your kid comes to you whining, “But I don’t know what to doooo!”, you can validate their frustration without changing your mind: “Ooh, I believe you. It’s frustrating to not have a plan. Remember, this is our boredom block. It’s okay to feel bored right now. You’re a creative kid and I know something will come to you…”
So go ahead and try it out: Put “boredom” on the calendar. It’s more powerful than it sounds.

Okay, we covered a lot of information about boredom. New ideas can feel exciting… and they can also feel overwhelming! Let’s ground ourselves in three key takeaways:

- Boredom isn’t a problem for parents to solve. It’s an opportunity for kids to build critical skills.
- Being “bored” is the gateway to creativity, independence, and resilience.
- You’re doing enough. You are enough. Ease the mental load of parenting over summer break by scheduling “boredom blocks” for your kid.
Most importantly, remember this: You just took time out of your (very!) busy schedule to reflect on how you’re raising your kid. That’s amazing, and your kid is so lucky to have you as their parent.

From summer boredom to school year struggles, we’re here to support you through every season of parenting.

Yes! It’s healthy for kids to be bored. The benefits of boredom for kids include expanded creativity, greater independence, and emotional regulation. Boredom gives kids the space and time to explore different roles, problem-solve, and create without constraints.

Normalizing boredom as a normal - if sometimes frustrating - experience. You can offer support rather than a solution: Say, “Boredom is tricky, and I know you’re a kid who can figure out tricky things.” You can also prepare your kids for boredom ahead of time by talking about boredom as a normal part of their day, especially in the summertime.

In the summer, kids tend to have less structure and more space in their schedule compared to the non-stop school year. Without back-to-back obligations, kids experience natural pauses in outside stimulation… and that makes it a great time to lean into the benefits of boredom for kids.

Two things are true: All kids benefit from boredom - and different kids need different kinds of support to access these benefits. Some kids experience boredom as an uncomfortable pause, while other kids experience it as an actual trigger. The latter is especially true for Deeply Feeling Kids or neurodivergent kids, who crave more predictability and structure.

This doesn’t mean we should avoid letting these kids be bored! Instead, it’s about supporting them through boredom differently. DFKs, for example, might need extra support preparing for boredom. Try creating a “boredom toolkit” together in advance, where your kid gets to pick two or three go-to ideas for when they feel bored. This can help them feel more in control when boredom inevitably shows up - once they have an idea of what to expect, it becomes a little bit easier to tolerate the discomfort of unstructured time.

Sometimes you don’t need a deeper dive. You just need to know what to do and exactly what to say. You’re covered here.
