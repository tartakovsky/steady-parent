# Wailing and Shrieking and Screeching, Oh My: How to Reduce Toddler Screaming

Source: Big Little Feelings

## Core Reframe: Screaming Is Normal, Common, and Healthy

Living with a screaming toddler is tough, but the behavior is completely normal from a developmental standpoint. Parents do not need to simply endure years of screaming or invest in earplugs. The screaming can be reduced through understanding and targeted strategies. How you respond depends entirely on identifying the underlying reason behind the scream.

## Three Reasons Toddlers Scream

### Reason 1: Brain Development Is Still in Progress

**When toddlers lack verbal skills:** Some toddlers simply do not have words at their disposal. When they experience a big feeling, they cannot "use their words" to communicate anger, frustration, excitement, or joy. Instead, they express themselves through shrieks, often at frequencies parents did not know were detectable by the human ear.

**When toddlers have words but do not use them:** This is one of the most common frustrations parents experience. They know their child can say "I'm sad" or "This is making me feel angry," yet the child screams instead. The reason is that the **upper parts of the brain** responsible for impulse control, managing emotions, communicating needs and desires, and controlling their bodies are still significantly under construction. Even when speech ability exists, the regulatory capacity to access those words in emotional moments does not. The result is shrieking at full intensity rather than articulating feelings.

### Reason 2: Experimenting with Loud Noises

Toddlers are new to the planet. Their developmental job is to explore the world and figure out how it works. Some screaming is simply part of discovering their own voice: experimenting with pitch, volume, and the effects of using their voice in different ways.

**The Grand Canyon analogy:** This experimentation is equivalent to an adult going to the Grand Canyon and shouting "Helloooooo" really loudly just to see if it might echo back.

**The attention feedback loop:** Part of this cause-and-effect discovery involves observing the effect the scream has on you. Toddlers crave parental attention so intensely that they will keep doing anything that gets attention, even "negative" attention. When a toddler lets out a big yell or scream and the parent has a big reaction back (a loud "no!" or "stop!"), this adds fuel to the fire and ultimately reinforces the screaming behavior.

### Reason 3: Getting What They Want

Toddlers love getting their way. They want to feel large and in charge, and they are not afraid to use screaming as a tool to make parents give in to their demands.

## The Mechanism for Reducing Screaming

### Core Principle: Impulse Control Must Be Practiced to Be Built

The brain needs practice to develop impulse control. You cannot expect impulse control without providing opportunities to practice and strengthen that capacity.

### The "Volume Up, Volume Down" Game

This is a structured game that builds brain capacity through real-life practice. The game has two phases:

**Phase 1: Turn up the volume.** Practice getting really, really, REALLY loud on purpose. This includes jumping up and down, screaming, and shouting.

**Phase 2: Turn the volume down.** Get extremely quiet, right down to a tiny little whisper.

**Variations of the game:**
- **Music version:** Quite literally turn the volume up on a song, then turn it down
- **Animal sounds version:** Go from the ROAR of a lion to the little squeak of a mouse
- **Natural voice version:** Shout, then whisper

### Why This Game Works

**Kids learn best through real-life experiences.** When you practice getting loud then quiet in real life, you give your child a safe opportunity to build the part of their brain that helps notice and manage noise levels. Over time, this builds into real impulse control.

### Critical Timing Requirement

**Do this during calm moments, not during screaming fits or tantrums.** Learning cannot happen in times of heightened emotions. When children practice at calm times, they strengthen that area of their brain, making that "little muscle" stronger and more easily accessible over time. This increased accessibility matters most during the inevitable tough moments.

## Anti-Pattern: Big Reactions to Screaming

Having a big reaction to screaming (loud "no!" or "stop!") adds fuel to the fire and reinforces the behavior. Even negative attention is still attention that toddlers crave.

## Expectations Calibration

Toddlers will still be loud and scream sometimes. This is simply part of toddlerhood and is actually a sign of healthy brain development. The goal is progress over perfection.

## Additional Strategies (Referenced)

Three additional strategies are mentioned as part of a broader approach:

1. **Get Quiet**
2. **Okay the Feelings** (validate the emotional experience)
3. **Tell Them What They Can Do** (redirect to acceptable alternatives)

## Underlying Developmental Framework

The content reflects a brain-based understanding of toddler behavior. The upper brain regions responsible for executive functions (impulse control, emotional regulation, need communication, body control) are under active construction during toddlerhood. This developmental reality explains why even verbal toddlers cannot consistently access their words during emotional moments. The solution is not to demand compliance but to practice and strengthen these capacities during calm periods so they become more accessible during challenging ones.
