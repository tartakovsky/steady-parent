# Why Naming and Accepting Your Toddler's Big Feelings Is Important

Source: Big Little Feelings

## Core Thesis

**Acknowledging and accepting your toddler's feelings is the first and most critical step toward decreasing the intensity and duration of tantrums.** This is not opinion but science-backed practice supported by developmental research on how affirming children's feelings makes them psychologically strong and emotionally resilient.

## The Fundamental Distinction: Feelings vs. Behavior

The central framework separates two domains that must be treated differently.

**Feelings are always acceptable.** Every emotion a child experiences is valid, regardless of how ridiculous or irrational it may seem to an adult. Children get to have their feelings without qualification or judgment.

**Behaviors may require limits.** While feelings are unconditionally accepted, behaviors can and should be bounded. Parents maintain firm boundaries on actions even while fully accepting the emotional experience driving those actions.

This distinction resolves the common parental concern that focusing on feelings promotes bad behavior. The answer is definitively no, because you are okaying the feeling, not the behavior.

## The Script Structure for Combining Acceptance with Limits

The verbal formula has three components delivered in sequence.

**Step 1: Name the feeling.** State what emotion the child is experiencing as an observation. Use "You're [feeling word]" as the opener.

**Step 2: Connect it to the cause.** Add "because [specific situation]" to show you understand the trigger and see their perspective.

**Step 3: Validate the feeling.** Say "It's okay to feel [feeling word]" to communicate unconditional acceptance of the emotional experience.

**Step 4 (when needed): State the behavioral boundary.** Add "It's not okay to [specific behavior]" followed by your protective action.

### Example Applications

**Situation: Toddler frustrated about food restriction**
"You're frustrated because I won't let you eat the dog food. It's okay to feel frustrated."

**Situation: Toddler sad about separation from loved one**
"You're sad because we can't go see grandma. It's okay to feel sad."

**Situation: Toddler jealous of a pet**
"You're jealous because your goldfish gets to swim all day. It's okay to feel jealous."

**Situation: Toddler angry at sibling with aggressive response**
"You're mad because baby sister took your toy. It's okay to feel mad. It's not okay to hurt someone. I'm moving baby sister over here to keep her safe."

**Situation: Toddler nervous about school with object-throwing behavior**
"You're nervous to go to school today. It's okay to feel nervous. It's not okay to throw your backpack. I'll carry your backpack to the car now."

## Why This Approach Works: The Mechanism

**Showing your toddler you hear, see, and understand them is the water hose extinguishing the burning embers of a meltdown.** The act of being witnessed and understood de-escalates emotional intensity. The child's nervous system calms when they sense attunement from their caregiver.

## Short-Term and Long-Term Benefits

### Immediate Effects

Reduces the intensity of tantrums. Shortens the duration of meltdowns. Creates less internal chaos for the child.

### Developmental Trajectory

Over time, with parental help, the toddler learns to name their own emotions. They develop the ability to cope with their feelings independently. This skill carries into adulthood.

### Adult Outcomes

The child becomes an emotionally healthy, resilient adult. They become the kind of person other people enjoy being around. They gain the capacity to handle difficult situations with grace and wisdom.

## The Daily Feelings Check-In Practice

### Why Calm Moments Matter Equally

**What you teach outside of a tantrum is just as important as your actions in the middle of one.** The value of calm-moment practice should not be underestimated. This structured routine serves dual purposes: it helps parents work through their own discomfort with feelings talk, and it cultivates the child's emotional development.

### Implementation Details

**Timing:** Choose a calm, winding-down moment such as bedtime or after quiet time.

**Format:** Ask three specific questions in sequence:
1. What did you feel happy about today?
2. What did you feel sad about today?
3. What are you looking forward to tomorrow (or after quiet time)?

**Style:** Keep it short and light to accommodate the toddler's short attention span.

### Expected Progression

Initial attempts may feel tricky and awkward. Over time, the home becomes a safe space where emotions can be felt and shared. The toddler gains the ability to verbalize feelings and cope with them in healthy ways.

### Starting Age and Preverbal Application

These conversations can begin around two years old, even before the child's language skills are fully developed. For preverbal toddlers, the parent can model the narration: "Hmm, when sister took your toy earlier, you felt sad. It's okay to feel sad." Preverbal toddlers understand more than adults typically recognize.

### The Ultimate Goal

The aspiration is for the child to eventually verbalize their emotional state ("I'm feeling so MAD!!!!") instead of acting it out through dysregulated behavior (becoming "the Tasmanian devil"). This outcome is described as entirely possible with consistent practice.

## Addressing Parental Resistance

### Common Objection Pattern

Many parents discover feelings-focused approaches while searching for help with meltdowns. They want behavioral solutions and may view feelings work as "new-age crapola," "weirdsies," or "woo woo." They may think: "I just want to fix my toddler's behavior."

### Cultural Context for Resistance

Most adults were raised in homes where certain feelings were categorized as "good" (happy) or "bad" (mad, sad). In general, there was no good reason to talk about any feelings. This upbringing creates understandable discomfort with explicit feelings language.

### Resolution

The resistance is acknowledged as making complete sense given typical backgrounds. The scientific evidence is offered as the basis for adopting the practice rather than relying on personal comfort or intuition. Research specifically shows that affirming children's feelings produces psychological strength and emotional resilience.

## Implicit Parenting Philosophy

**Grace-filled parenting operates without shame, guilt, and unrealistic expectations.** Parents can become the cool, calm, confident leader of their home. The parent's well-being matters alongside the child's well-being.
