# What to Do When Your Toddler Won't Share

## Core Understanding: Why Sharing Is Difficult for Toddlers

**Sharing is inherently hard** because being protective of possessions is a primal instinct. This explains why children seem to emerge from infancy already claiming "MINE!" The impulse to guard resources is deeply wired, not a character flaw or parenting failure.

However, **becoming a well-adjusted, kind, and compassionate human requires learning to share**, which places parents in the role of teaching this counter-instinctual skill.

## Strategy #1: Be a Sportscaster, Not a Referee

### The Instinct to Fix (and Why It Fails)

When parents witness a toy tug-of-war, the natural impulse is to "throw on a striped jersey" and intervene as a referee to fix the situation immediately. This instinct is strong and feels helpful.

### Why Referee-Style Intervention Backfires

**Coordinating turns, ripping toys from one child's hands to give to another** produces a predictable result: children are "right back into sharing battles 4 seconds later and all day every day."

**The root cause of this failure**: When parents jump in to fix disputes, they limit the child's opportunity to learn. Without that learning opportunity, the same patterns of shrill shrieking over sharing will repeat indefinitely.

### The Sportscaster Approach: Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Narrate What You See**

The first move toward helping feuding children work it out is to simply describe the situation without judgment or solution.

**Example phrasing**: "I see two friends who are feeling sad and mad. Emma wants to play with the ball, and Micah wants to play with the ball, too."

This narration acknowledges both children's feelings and desires without taking sides or imposing an outcome.

**Step 2: Invite a Child-Generated Solution**

After narrating, give children the chance to devise their own resolution.

**Example phrasing**: "Hmmm, what could you two do here?"

### Important Notes on the Child-Solution Step

**Parents may be skeptical** that this step will produce results, but the approach often works surprisingly well.

**For pre-verbal toddlers**: They will likely stare blankly as if the parent has "sprouted horns." This is expected. The parent should still empower the child with the opportunity to solve the dispute. Over time, as verbal skills develop, children will realize they can calmly and kindly work things out with friends. This is a life skill worth cultivating.

**The long-term payoff**: Building the habit of pausing and inviting solutions teaches children that conflict resolution is within their own capability.

**Step 3: Offer a Suggestion (When Needed)**

If neither child (verbal or not) produces an idea for resolution, the parent can then offer a concrete suggestion.

**Example phrasing**: "Okay, I'm going to help you come up with a solution. Emma, you can play with the ball first, and when you're done, say 'all done' and hand it to Micah."

Note the structure: clear turn order, specific signal for transition ("all done"), and physical handoff instruction. This provides a concrete, executable plan rather than an abstract concept like "take turns."

## Strategy #2: Address Aggression Immediately

### When the Sportscaster Approach Must Pause

The broadcaster stance works well "until someone puts an eye out." When the sharing dispute involves **hitting, pulling, or aggression of any kind**, the "here's how we share" teaching must be set aside entirely.

### The Safety-First Response

**Step in calmly and quickly** to diffuse the situation and keep everyone safe.

**Example phrasing**: "I see two mad kids hitting each other. I need to keep everyone safe. Lee, come sit right here. Tasha, come sit right here. We're taking a break to let our bodies calm down."

Note the structure: Narrate what you observe (maintaining sportscaster stance briefly), state the safety priority clearly, physically separate the children to specific locations, and explicitly name the purpose (calming bodies).

### Sequencing: Safety, Then Calm, Then Teaching

**Only after everyone is safe and calm** can you circle back to brainstorming how they can share the toy.

### Why Calm Must Come First

**Toddlers are not receptive to correction when overwhelmed by big feelings.** (The authors acknowledge this applies to adults too: "Honestly? Same.") Teaching sharing strategies to a dysregulated child will not land.

**The priority sequence is**: Safety first, calm second, then problem-solving and learning.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Jumping in immediately to coordinate turns**: Prevents learning and produces short-lived "fixes" that require constant repetition.

**Ripping toys from one child to give to another**: Does not teach sharing, just demonstrates that adults use force to redistribute possessions.

**Teaching sharing strategies during aggression or high emotion**: Children cannot absorb lessons when dysregulated.

**Skipping the invitation for child-generated solutions**: Misses the opportunity to build problem-solving capability and independence.

## Key Principles Summary

**Opportunity to learn requires space to struggle**: Fixing every dispute removes the developmental chance for children to build skills.

**Narration validates without solving**: Acknowledging feelings and the situation helps children feel seen while keeping the resolution work with them.

**Child-generated solutions build life skills**: Even when children cannot yet produce solutions, the repeated invitation establishes that they are capable participants in conflict resolution.

**Calm is prerequisite to learning**: Correction during emotional overwhelm does not register; prioritize regulation before instruction.

**Aggression changes the protocol**: Physical safety overrides all teaching goals; separate, calm, then return to the issue.
