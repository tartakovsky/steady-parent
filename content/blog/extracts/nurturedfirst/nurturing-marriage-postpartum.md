# Strengthening Your Relationship After Having a Baby

**Source:** Nurtured First (Jess VanderWier, MA, RP; article by Christy Doering, LCSW)

## Core Premise

The transition to parenthood places unprecedented stress on romantic relationships. Despite extensive preparation (hospital bags, nursery setup, baby clothes), most couples underestimate the relational strain that follows. Proactive relationship maintenance is essential because **babies are inherently hard on marriages**. The contrast between the celebratory pregnancy phase (gender reveals, showers, nursery planning) and the reality of newborn care (sleep deprivation, endless laundry, constant crying) creates a jarring shock.

## The Fundamental Promise

Weathering this difficult transition together is precisely what can bring couples closer for the long term. The stress reveals previously unknown aspects of each partner, but navigating these revelations successfully strengthens the bond.

## Strategy 1: Maintain Temporal Perspective

**Key insight:** The intensity of the baby phase is finite, lasting approximately one year.

**What to expect:**
- Sleep will eventually return
- Couples will regain time to enjoy each other
- Independence increases as the baby develops independence

**Personal example from the author:** Weeks after their first baby, the author was in tears, questioning the decision to have children, unable to comprehend why anyone would have more than one child. This despair is normal and temporary. The author later had two more children, demonstrating that conditions genuinely improve.

**Causal chain:** Acute exhaustion distorts perception of permanence. Reminding yourself of the temporary nature of this phase prevents despair from damaging the relationship.

## Strategy 2: Practice Reciprocal Generosity ("Pay It Forward")

**Core mechanism:** Give your partner time, touch, help, or whatever they most miss.

**Concrete actions:**
- Periodically offer your partner a full day off to do whatever they want
- Explicitly ask for what you need in return

**How this works:**
- Small acts of generosity build goodwill between partners
- Trust develops: "the more you give, the more you get"
- This creates a virtuous cycle benefiting both partners

**Key requirement:** Asking for what you want is equally important as giving. Both directions must flow.

## Strategy 3: Share Baby Care Responsibilities

**Anti-pattern: Gatekeeping**

One parent (typically the primary caregiver) refuses to let the other parent help with baby care, believing their way is the only correct way.

**Consequences of gatekeeping:**
1. The primary parent becomes exhausted
2. The excluded parent feels incompetent to care for the baby
3. The excluded parent feels neglected
4. One person carries all the burden while resentment builds on both sides

**Benefits of shared care:**
- Both parents develop independent confidence as capable caregivers
- Watching your partner's relationship with the baby grow becomes a source of renewed love
- The baby benefits from bonding with both parents

**Therapeutic observation:** This gatekeeping pattern is commonly seen in couples therapy and is a major source of relationship trouble postpartum.

## Strategy 4: Monitor and Adjust Communication Tone

**Key principle:** How you speak matters as much as what you say.

**Anti-pattern example:**
> "You should have been awake with me at night while the baby was up"

This sounds judgmental and critical, triggering defensiveness.

**Effective pattern:** Lead with your feelings, which are inarguable, then state your need.
> "I'm so exhausted all the time, and when I'm up alone with the baby at night, I start to feel resentful and frustrated. I need some support at night."

**Implementation:**
- Requires more thought and planning before speaking
- Results in dramatically different tone and reception

**Vocabulary adjustment:** Remove the word "should" from your vocabulary entirely.

**Replacement phrases:**
- "I wish..."
- "We could..."
- Direct reference to your feelings

**Causal chain:** "Should" implies judgment and blame, which triggers defensiveness and shuts down productive conversation. Feelings-based language opens dialogue because feelings cannot be argued against.

## Strategy 5: Reject the "Competition of Suffering" Dynamic

**Anti-pattern: "My life is harder than your life" fight**

This occurs when each partner tries to convince the other that they are worse off. Each person lists all the unfair aspects of their role (parenting, working, housekeeping, caregiving) to prove they have it harder.

**Why couples do this:** They want their partner to understand how overwhelmed, overworked, and unappreciated they feel.

**Why it fails:**
- It becomes a competition with no winner
- Leads to increased resentment
- Both partners end up feeling even less appreciated
- No actual help results from the exchange

**Effective alternative:** Skip the comparison entirely and directly ask for what you want.

**Mechanism of success:**
1. Trust enables your partner to hear your request
2. When they trust you, they will agree to help
3. You reciprocate when they ask
4. Give-and-take rhythm develops
5. The couple finds their groove

**Key insight:** The goal is getting needs met, not proving who has it worse. Direct requests accomplish the goal; competition undermines it.

## Strategy 6: Build a Reliable Support Network ("Babysitting Bench")

**Who to recruit:**
- Family members
- Friends
- Fellow parents
- Local babysitters

**Purpose:** Create opportunities for couple time outside the parenting context.

**Guidelines for date nights:**
- Do not talk about the baby during the date
- If dinner feels like too much pressure, choose lower-stakes activities (movie, hike together)
- The goal is grown-up time that nurtures the romantic relationship

**Expect initial difficulty:**
- You may struggle to think of anything but your baby at first
- It may feel strange or awkward initially
- Do not be discouraged by this adjustment period

**Long-term outcome:** These nights out become cherished. Additionally, as the baby grows, they will enjoy time with trusted babysitters.

## Strategy 7: Prioritize the Couple as the Family's Foundation

**Core principle:** The couple, as a team, is the most important piece of the family unit.

**Reminder of origin:** The family exists because you love each other. This foundation predates and underlies everything else.

**Practical application:** Whether dealing with diapers, in-laws, colic, or any other challenge, united couples manage difficulties better than divided ones.

**Required actions:**
- Make each other a priority
- Talk to each other consistently
- Put the relationship first, even above parenting demands

**Causal logic:** Being on good terms creates the resilience and cooperation needed to handle the inevitable stresses of parenthood. The relationship is the infrastructure that supports everything else.
