## Core Position

Screen time is a **nuanced topic** that cannot be answered with simple yes/no responses. The author rejects black-and-white thinking and instead offers guidelines based on evidence-based research and years of supporting families.

## Research Findings on Screen Time

### What Children Do Not Need

Children do not "need" screen time for development. This challenges the common argument that screen time serves as an educational tool essential for child development.

### Age-Dependent Learning Capacity

**Older children (age 3+):** Research demonstrates they can learn and retain information from educational programs.

**Younger toddlers and babies:** Research indicates they are NOT "learning" anything specific from screens. While TV can hold their attention, there is solid evidence that early learning is done best through:
- Actual lived experience
- Real-time interaction
- Physical space engagement
- Interaction with people

### Correlation Findings (Not Causation)

**Key finding:** EXCESSIVE screen use is CORRELATED with potential:
- Language development delays
- Cognitive development delays
- Attention issues in children under 5

### Critical Distinction: Correlation vs Causation

**Correlation:** Action A may be related to action B, but one does not necessarily cause the other.

**Causation:** One action directly causes another to happen.

**Important clarification:** The research does NOT show that screen time causes developmental delays. The words "excessive" and "correlated" are critical qualifiers.

**Illustrative example:** Ice cream sales are highest at the same time of year that homicides are highest (correlation). This does not mean eating ice cream causes homicides. Other factors like weather and daylight hours explain both phenomena.

**Application to screen time:** While correlation exists between high screen time and decreased language development/attention issues, factors outside of screen time may be responsible.

## The Real Concern: Displacement Effect

The primary concern is not screen time itself but **what screen time displaces**. Parents should evaluate:

### Questions to Ask

**Does screen time take away from a child's ability to be bored?**
- Being bored and finding creative solutions are essential for children's development

**Do you still get time reading, laughing, and playing with your child?**
- Playing and spending time laughing with your kids is an important part of building a secure relationship

**Does it take away from open-ended play?**
- Open-ended play is an integral part of children's development

### Typical Family Pattern

In the author's experience, most families use screen time as a tool while remaining active and engaged parents. Their children still have time to:
- Experience boredom
- Engage in open-ended play outside of screen time

## Screen Time as a Parenting Tool

### The Often-Missed Nuance

The question frequently overlooked: **How can screen time serve parents?**

### Legitimate Use Cases

**Safe meal preparation:** Allows parents to make dinner safely without a toddler crying at their leg, preventing either no dinner being made or the parent losing their temper.

**Rest during illness:** A sick toddler can sit and rest their body while the parent accomplishes necessary work.

**Postpartum support with newborn:** A mother with a newborn and postpartum depression can talk and bond with her baby while watching TV, describing characters to the infant.

**Physical recovery:** The author's personal example: As a postpartum mom in a pandemic parenting alone, screen time provided an hour to sit down, rest her body, and nurse her baby while her 3-year-old watched shows. This allowed physical healing.

### Key Principle

Screen time can be a tool that serves parents well, provided they remember:
- **Moderation** matters
- What happens **outside** of screen time matters

### Toolbox Metaphor

Screen time should be one tool in your parenting toolbox. It is not your only tool, but it can be available when needed.

## Five Guidelines for Screen Time

### 1. Set Routines Around Screen Time

**Why:** Clear boundaries help children know when screen time starts and finishes.

**Example:** The author's 3-year-old watched a show daily while the baby went down for a nap. The child knew:
- This was her designated show time
- The parent got a break
- After a certain number of episodes, the show would be turned off

### 2. Not All Screen Time Is Created Equal

**Recommendation:** Limit exposure to fast-paced shows.

**Fast-paced shows to limit:** Cocomelon, Paw Patrol
- These may cause children to become overstimulated

**Slower-paced shows recommended:**
- Daniel Tiger
- Bluey
- Mr. Rogers

**Individualization:** Parents know their child best. Be mindful of your child's temperament and ability to handle fast-paced content.

### 3. Co-Watch Shows When Possible

**Implementation:** Family movie night (author does Friday nights).

**Benefits:**
- Bonding experience with your child
- Opportunity for engaging questions

**Example questions during co-viewing:**
- "What do you notice about Elsa's face when Anna says this?"
- "What do you think Daniel Tiger is feeling?"

### 4. Be Aware of What They Are Watching

**Requirement:** Children should watch AGE-APPROPRIATE content.

**Consequences of inappropriate content:** The author has observed many children struggle with:
- Nightmares
- Fears
...resulting from watching shows too mature for them.

**Prevention strategy:** Pre-watch movies or research them before watching with your kids.

### 5. Other General Guidelines

**Outside of screen time, ensure:**
- Ample time for open-ended play
- Time for being bored
- Time for talking, singing, and reading

**Screen placement:**
- Keep screens in public areas of the house
- No screens in bedrooms

**Parental modeling:**
- "Model Model Model!!!" (emphasized three times)
- Kids are watching parental behavior

## Addressing Parental Guilt

### Permission to Release Guilt

Parents are encouraged to **release themselves from guilt** about using screen time as a parenting tool.

### Warning Sign and Support

**Concern indicator:** If screen time feels like your only tool and you have it on all day because you believe it is the only way to get through the day with your kids.

**Recommended action:** Reach out for support. Therapists can help build up the parenting toolbox to include a wide range of strategies.

**Reassurance:** You are not alone.
