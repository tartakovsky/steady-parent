## Core Problem: People-Pleasing in Parenting

**People-pleasers often originate as parent-pleasers.** Adults who struggle to say "No," "Stop," "I can't let you," or "I won't let you" to their children frequently developed these tendencies in childhood.

### Origins of People-Pleasing
- Growing up needing to keep the peace in the home
- Feeling required to act a certain way to earn parental praise or affection
- Learning to rely on others being happy with you to feel "good enough"

### How People-Pleasing Manifests in Parenting
- Fear of setting boundaries
- Fear of appearing as "the bad guy"
- Fear that saying no will reduce the child's love for the parent
- Wanting to be seen as "good" by children
- Wanting children to desire a relationship with the parent

**Key Insight:** These desires (being loved, being seen as good, having a close relationship) are not inherently bad. The problem arises when they become the driving force behind parenting decisions.

## The Problematic Core Fear

**Core fear pattern:** "If my child is mad at me, then I am a bad parent."

Parenting from this core fear leads to getting stuck in challenging situations.

### Concrete Examples of Fear-Driven Parenting
1. **Bedtime capitulation:** Allowing the child to dictate their own bedtime to avoid their upset
2. **Property destruction tolerance:** Allowing the child to damage important possessions (e.g., coloring on furniture) because taking the marker away might cause anger
3. **Unnecessary purchasing:** Buying toys the child added to the shopping cart solely to avoid a tantrum

### Emotional Consequence
Parenting from a place of always needing children to be happy with you to feel like a good parent leads to feeling hurt and disappointed repeatedly.

## Breaking the Cycle

**Central realization:** Boundaries are loving to both children and ourselves.

### Permissible Boundary Statements
- "It is time for bed."
- "I can't let you play with this marker near the couch."
- "We won't be buying any toys at the store today. We are only going to get groceries."

**Critical acceptance:** It is also okay if the child is angry about the boundary.

## Three-Step Framework for Holding Boundaries

### Step 1: Connect With the Feelings

**Why connection matters:** When children feel misunderstood, they often escalate their anger to ensure the parent truly grasps the magnitude of their feeling.

**Goal:** Let them know you see, hear, and understand how the boundary makes them feel.

#### Anti-Pattern: Dismissing Feelings
- "It's just a toy car; you have hundreds of them at home. You don't need another one."

This dismissal invalidates the child's experience and often intensifies the emotional reaction.

#### Effective Pattern: Acknowledging the Want
- "I get that you really want me to buy that toy car for you."

#### Advanced Technique: Imaginative Empathy
Take acknowledgment further by imagining out loud how enjoyable the desired thing would be:
- "It would be so fun to bring that toy car home and play with it! You could race it with your other cars and put it down your favourite ramp. I get it; it's so fun to get new toys."

### Step 2: Set Boundaries Around the Behavior

Combine emotional connection with clear boundary articulation.

**Example script:** "We are not going to buy any toys at the store today. We are just here to get some groceries. I see that's tough."

#### Handling Tears
- Tears in response to boundaries are acceptable and expected
- Children are allowed to have tears while the parent confidently holds the boundary
- **Curiosity stance:** Stay curious about why the boundary is difficult (tiredness, hunger, need for physical movement, genuine love for the item)

**Acknowledgment of tears:** "I see your tears; it's ok to be sad about it."

**Key principle:** Allowing tears while holding boundaries provides children a safe space to release their big feelings before moving forward.

### Step 3: Move Forward

After the boundary is set and feelings are processed, use narrative techniques to help the child transition.

#### Technique A: Future Imagination
Ask the child to envision what it would be like next time without the boundary:
- "Hey buddy, I know it was hard to leave the store without the toy car. I wonder what it would be like to play with it? What would you do first?"

#### Technique B: Personal Story Sharing
Share a parallel experience from your own childhood to normalize the experience:
- "When I was a kid, Grandma took me to the store with her, and there was a doll that I really wanted! I was really sad when Grandma said no, but we played together with the dolls I already had when we got home. It was sad not to get a new doll, but I had so much fun playing with Grandma and my other dolls."

#### Technique C: Narrating the Child's Coping
Retell the child's own experience, highlighting their successful emotional processing:
- "Hey, sweetie! I know it was really tough when you couldn't buy the toy car at the store today. You were really sad about it and let out some tears. When we got home, we played with your cars, and you remembered how fun the ones you already have are!"

## Core Affirmations for Parents

**Boundary-setting mindset reframes:**

1. **"It's ok for my child to be mad at me."** Child anger does not indicate parental failure.

2. **"My child is allowed to ask me for the world, and I am allowed to say no."** Requests and refusals are both legitimate parts of the parent-child relationship.

3. **"I can be a good parent, AND my child can be upset when I tell them they can't have another toy."** These two states can coexist; they are not mutually exclusive.

## The Loving Nature of Boundaries

**Fundamental principle:** Setting boundaries that protect your mental health, your child's safety, or another person's safety is a loving thing to do.

Boundaries and love are not in opposition. They coexist and reinforce each other.
