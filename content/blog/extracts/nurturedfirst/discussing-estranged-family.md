# Discussing Estranged Family With Your Child

**Source:** Nurtured First (Shannon Wassenaar, Registered Psychotherapist)
**Age Groups:** Preschooler, Big Kid (covers ages 1-12)
**Core Problem:** How to explain estrangement, unsafe relatives, or toxic family members to children in a way they can understand while preserving the child's emotional wellbeing and, where possible, their positive memories of the relationship

## Central Case Study

**Maria and Felix:** Maria's father (Felix's grandfather) was very close with her 8-year-old son. Christmas was Felix's favorite time because grandfather took him skating, for hot chocolate, and to movies during school break. The grandfather relapsed into alcohol use and became aggressive when drinking, making him unsafe to be around. Maria needed to explain this separation to Felix while preserving the relationship quality Felix had with his grandfather.

## What to Expect: Anticipating Child Reactions

### Anticipate Outbursts

**Why they happen:** Separation from a loved one (temporary or permanent) triggers fear, sadness, and anger in children.

**What to expect:**
- Big eruptions of feelings
- More tears than usual
- Bedtime battles
- Increased tantrums

**Critical distinction:** Anticipating outbursts does NOT mean permitting harmful behavior. Children should not be allowed to hit, scream, or throw toys. The purpose of anticipation is to:
1. Understand what the behavior is trying to communicate
2. Provide an extra measure of patience and compassion during this time

### Anticipate Curiosity

**Why it matters:** Children are naturally curious and will have many questions.

**Common questions children may ask:**
- "Why isn't [person] going to be at [event] this year?"
- "Did I do something wrong? Is [person] mad at me?"
- "When will I get to see [person] again?"

**Preparation strategy:**
1. Make a written list of questions you think your child will ask
2. Prepare answers to these questions in advance
3. Practice reciting answers (mirror, trusted adult, or counselor)
4. Goal: Respond to tough questions with confidence

**When you don't have an answer:** It is acceptable to tell your child you need time to think, but you MUST return to them with an answer. Do not leave questions unanswered indefinitely.

## How to Discuss Tricky Family Dynamics

### Foundational Principle

The more confident you are (or appear to be), the more secure your child can feel during these discussions. Preparation enables confidence.

### Set a Designated Time

**Benefits for adults:**
- Opportunity to plan what to say
- Time to prepare for questions

**Benefits for children:**
- Setting aside specific time and place promotes feelings of safety
- When kids feel safe, they can process thoughts and feelings and ask questions

**Timing to avoid:**
- Before school
- Before a playdate
- Before bedtime

**Reasoning:** These times create pressure or prevent proper processing.

### Use Age-Appropriate Language and Tools

**Toddlers (Ages 1-3): Use Play**

Best approach: Role-play with favorite toys, creating situations that resemble your family dynamic to gently introduce tricky topics.

Example script: "Baby giraffe can't see Grandpa giraffe right now. It's not safe. This makes the baby giraffe really sad. He cries when he's sad, and that's okay."

**Preschoolers (Ages 3-5): Use Storytelling**

Best approach: Tell a story or read a storybook together. Use relatable analogies from the child's own experience.

Example script: "Remember the time mommy separated you from Tommy when he was having a hard time playing safely? Sometimes, this happens to adults too. Right now, Mommy needs some space from Auntie to keep us safe. Do you have any questions about this?"

**School-Aged Children (Ages 6-12): Be Direct**

Best approach: Focus on facts delivered in a way that is gentle, straightforward, and compassionate.

Key elements to include:
1. State the situation clearly
2. Name it if appropriate ("This is called being estranged")
3. Reassure them it is not their fault
4. Affirm the love exists despite the separation
5. Keep the door open for future questions

Example script: "Grandma isn't a safe person to be around, so we don't see or talk to her anymore, even on the holidays. This is called being estranged. I want you to know this has nothing to do with you. Grandma loves you very much. You can come to me any time if you want to ask questions or talk more about this."

### Take a Break

**Why breaks are acceptable:** Tackling tricky topics can feel heavy. It may be too much to handle in one sitting for either parent or child.

**When to pause:**
- Getting stuck
- Feeling overwhelmed

**Why pausing is better than pushing through:** It is better to be thoughtful and confident in your approach than to rush into an answer.

**How to pause (script):** "I'm noticing this conversation's feeling tricky for both of us. I think it would be best for us to press 'pause' and come back to this discussion tomorrow afternoon."

**Critical follow-through:** If you pause, you MUST return to the conversation as promised.

## Responding to Big Feelings and Tricky Questions

### Validate Feelings

**Why validation is essential:** Children need to feel heard, understood, and reassured. This is one of the most important aspects of supporting children through difficult family dynamics.

**Create room for ALL emotions:** Even emotions that don't make sense to you must be given space.

**Validation script example:** "I can see this is really upsetting for you. That makes so much sense. You love Grandpa, and you're really sad that he's not going to be at Christmas."

### Make Room for Tears

**Why tears matter:** Tears are a sign that your child is doing the important work of feeling their sadness around the circumstance.

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't talk too much
- Don't try to "fix" the tears

**What TO do:**
- Ensure they are safe
- Be present with them

**When there are no tears:**

Absence of tears does NOT mean the child is not upset. Tricky topics take time for kids to process.

**Helping children find their tears:**
- Do bedtime check-ins before sleep
- Ask questions like: "Did anything feel tricky today?"
- These questions may stir up tears the child has been holding onto

## Nurturing Safe Relationships: Two Strategies

### Why This Matters

Safe and healthy relationships with caring adults are essential to a child's growth and development. This is especially true for children in families with complex dynamics.

**When to focus on this:** When a child is:
- Struggling to grapple with loss of a close family relationship
- Feeling anxious about separation from an unsafe or toxic relative

**Goal:** Ensure other caretakers signal to the child that they are safe, loved, and cared for.

### Strategy 1: Build in Extra Connection

**Core principle:** Set aside time for your child. Add tiny moments of connection throughout the day.

**Practical examples:**
- Write a love note and put it in lunch box or pocket before school
- Invite child to make a special dinner together once a week
- Add a bedtime check-in to evening routine

**Underlying mechanism:** Any way you signal to a child that you see them and are there to provide for their needs will sustain them as they navigate emotions from family conflict.

### Strategy 2: Build Their Attachment Village

**Definition of Attachment Village:** A group of people a child feels a sense of belonging and connection with, including extended family, neighbors, and family friends.

**Why it is vital:** The more safe, loving, and healthy adults a child has supporting them, the more equipped the child is to cope with adversity.

**When to apply:** When one relationship is strained or lost, promote other safe relationships.

**Implementation example (Maria and Felix):**
- Felix spent significant time playing hockey
- Maria made extra effort to connect her son with his coaches
- She highlighted commonalities: "Did you know your head coach was the same number as you when he played hockey!"
- She shared positive feedback: "Your coaches told me they loved having you on the team."
- She hosted Felix's coach and family for dinner to build connections with trusted adults

**Critical clarification:** These new relationships are NOT intended to replace the estranged, unsafe, or toxic family member. The purpose is to foster a village of support so the child can get the measure of care they need when apart from you and facing tricky situations.

## Key Takeaways (Summary Framework)

1. **Anticipating Reactions:** Prepare for strong emotions (fear, sadness, anger) and questions. Have prepared answers ready.

2. **Discussing with Care:** Schedule specific time. Use age-appropriate language. Use toys to visualize for young children. It is okay to pause and continue later.

3. **Validation and Support:** Help child process feelings by validating them. Reassure them their feelings are heard and it is healthy to express them.

4. **Fostering Connection:** Ensure child feels loved and cared for through quality time and activities they enjoy.

5. **Building an Attachment Village:** Create strong support system outside immediate family. Encourage bonding with safe, trusted adults (teachers, neighbors, parents of friends).

6. **Seek Professional Help If Needed:** If navigating the situation is challenging or child has difficulty accepting circumstances, seek help from a trained professional.
