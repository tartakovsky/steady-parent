# Model Healthy Communication for Your Child

Source: Nurtured First (Jess VanderWier, MA, RP)

## Core Problem

Communication is essential for building healthy, meaningful relationships, yet it is not formally taught in schools. Most adults lack the time or energy to take dedicated communication courses, leaving a gap in how families learn to interact effectively. Children learn communication patterns primarily through observation, making parental modeling critical.

## Theoretical Foundation: Social Learning Theory

**Albert Bandura's Social Learning Theory (1977)** provides the framework for understanding how children acquire communication skills.

### The Concept of Modelling

**Modelling** occurs when individuals learn behavior by observing others and noting the consequences of those behaviors. Children do not need direct instruction; they absorb communication patterns by watching how adults interact with each other and with them.

### Key Insight

Children observe not only how you speak to them but also how you interact with other people (spouse, relatives, friends, coworkers). They may begin to **mimic your communication patterns** even from interactions they were not part of.

## Modelling Examples and Causal Chains

### Pattern 1: Yelling as Effective Communication

**Observed behavior:** Parent yells at other parent and consistently gets their way.

**Child's learning:** Yelling is an effective way to communicate needs and get desired outcomes.

**Outcome:** Child adopts yelling as a primary communication strategy.

### Pattern 2: Calm Discussion Despite Disagreement

**Observed behavior:** Parent who is upset calmly discusses feelings while respecting the other parent's opinion.

**Child's learning:** One can communicate needs calmly and still get their point across even when upset.

**Outcome:** Child develops calm, respectful communication under stress.

### Pattern 3: Emotional Shutdown

**Observed behavior:** Parent who is upset shuts down and does not express feelings.

**Child's learning:** Emotions should be internalized; discussing feelings with others is not appropriate.

**Outcome:** Child suppresses emotions and avoids emotional expression.

### Pattern 4: Expressing Emotions Despite Discomfort

**Observed behavior:** Parent communicates feelings even when not happy.

**Child's learning:** Having different emotions is acceptable, and those emotions can be expressed in healthy ways.

**Outcome:** Child becomes comfortable with emotional expression and regulation.

## Three Core Strategies

### Strategy 1: Model the Communication You Want to See

**Principle:** If you want your child to communicate in a way that is respectful, calm, and clear, you must practice communicating this way with everyone around you.

**Why it matters:** Modelling is described as "HUGE" in promoting healthy communication skills. Children look up to adults as their primary teachers of communication.

**Scope of influence:** This applies to all adults in a child's life: parents, teachers, therapists, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and any other caregiving figures.

**Practical implication:** Every interaction you have is a potential teaching moment for observing children.

### Strategy 2: Listen to Your Children

**Principle:** Listening is a key component of communication. To have children listen to you, you must first model healthy listening to them.

**Active Listening Techniques:**

1. **Make eye contact** while they are talking to you
   - Specific anti-pattern: Do not scroll through emails or social media on phone or computer during conversation

2. **Allow complete expression** before responding
   - Let your child finish their entire thought without interruption

3. **Recap and confirm understanding**
   - After the child finishes, summarize what they said back to them
   - Purpose: Ensures the child feels fully understood and allows you to verify accurate comprehension
   - **Starter phrases:**
     - "So what I hear you saying is..."
     - "Let me make sure I understand you, is this... what you meant?"

**Dual benefit:** This strategy both models healthy communication and provides valuable insight into your child's needs and wants.

### Strategy 3: Allow Your Child to Communicate Their Choices

**Principle:** Offer **structured choices** to help children become effective communicators and decision-makers.

**Research support:** Teaching children to make choices from a young age helps them become more independent and better problem solvers later in life.

#### Structured Choice Examples

| Instead of (Command) | Try (Structured Choice) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| "It's time for bed." | "Would you like to go to bed at 7:15 or 7:30?" |
| "Brush your teeth." | "Would you like to brush your teeth before or after we read a book?" |
| "Set the table." | "Would you like to set the table or help do the dishes?" |

#### Include Children in Family Decision-Making

**Range of decisions:** Both small decisions (what to eat for dinner) and big decisions (moving to a new home) can involve children.

**Benefits:**
- Children learn problem-solving by observing the decision-making process
- Children develop confidence in communicating their own choices as they grow older

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Yelling and Nagging

**Why they seem appealing:** In the short term, yelling and nagging may appear to be easy solutions when a child is not listening.

**Why they fail:** These methods do not promote healthy communication development and create a less peaceful home environment.

**The alternative:** Consistently using the three strategies above reduces the temptation to resort to yelling and nagging.

### Distracted Listening

Checking emails, scrolling social media, or engaging with devices while a child is speaking communicates that their words are not valued and models poor listening behavior.

### Interrupting

Responding before the child has finished their thought prevents full expression and teaches children that complete communication is not expected or respected.

### Commands Without Options

Issuing directives without offering choices removes opportunities for children to practice decision-making and communicating their preferences.

## Expected Outcomes

When the three strategies are consistently applied:

1. **Reduced conflict** in parent-child relationships
2. **More peace** in relationships overall
3. **Decreased need for yelling and nagging**
4. **A happier, more peaceful home environment**
5. **Children who develop healthy communication skills**
6. **Children who become good listeners**
7. **Children who can make independent decisions**
8. **Children who can problem-solve effectively**
9. **Children who communicate their choices with confidence**

## Summary of the Three Tips

1. **Model healthy communication** in all your interactions because children learn by observing you with others, not just with them.

2. **Teach listening by listening** to your child with full attention, allowing complete expression, and confirming understanding through recap.

3. **Allow children to make decisions and communicate choices** through structured options and inclusion in family decision-making processes.
