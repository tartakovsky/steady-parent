# Encouraging Good Behaviour Through "Noticing The Good"

Source: Nurtured First (Jess VanderWier, MA, RP)

## Core Principle

**"Notice the behaviour you want"** is the single most effective parenting technique for changing behaviour. This principle, also known as **positive reinforcement**, is backed by behavioural psychology research and can be universally applied to any problem behaviour.

## The Fundamental Mechanism

### Why Noticing Positive Behaviour Works

1. Noticing behaviour you like initiates a **positive feedback loop** between parent and child
2. This feedback loop encourages the child to **want to work with you** rather than against you
3. When problem behaviours emerge, they often indicate the parent has stopped using this technique consistently

### Why Typical Parenting Approaches Fail

**Common parental default mode**: focusing on eliminating unwanted behaviours through corrections ("Don't do this, stop that, why do you always do that?")

**The problem with this approach**:
1. It draws attention to behaviours you do not want to see
2. It gives attention to undesirable behaviours
3. **Critical behavioural psychology insight**: giving attention to behaviours you do not want to see increases the likelihood those behaviours will recur
4. This effect is especially pronounced when children are not being noticed for behaviours their parent does like

**Causal chain**: Negative focus leads to attention on unwanted behaviour leads to reinforcement of unwanted behaviour leads to increased frequency of that behaviour.

## Implementation Framework

### Verbal Noticing

The key action is not just internally recognizing good behaviour but **explicitly telling the child** what you observed.

**Tone requirement**: Use a **happy, excited tone** when noticing behaviour you like.

### Non-Verbal Noticing Methods

Positive behaviour can also be reinforced through non-verbal communication:
- Smiling
- Giving a wink
- Giving a thumbs-up
- Giving a high-five
- Rubbing the child's head
- Patting the child's shoulder

## Specific Application Examples

### 1. Reducing Aggressive Behaviours (Hitting, Biting)

**What to notice**: Calm play, choosing alternatives to aggression

**Example phrases**:
- "Look how calmly you are playing with mommy! I love that!"
- "I can see you got frustrated and you chose another toy instead of hitting your brother. Well done!"

### 2. Sitting at the Table to Eat

**What to notice**: Any component of the desired behaviour, even partial success

**Example phrases**:
- "Look at how well you hold your knife"
- "Wow, you've been sitting on your chair for two minutes now, well done!"

### 3. Sibling Harmony

**What to notice**: Peaceful play, acts of kindness and sharing

**Example phrases**:
- "Wow you have played so nicely for the last 10 minutes"
- "I noticed you shared your hair ties with your sister when she couldn't find any this morning for school. That was very kind."

### 4. Learning New Skills (e.g., Tying Shoes)

**What to notice**: Effort and incremental progress, not just mastery

**Example phrases**:
- "Well done for getting your shoes today! Let's see if you can tie the laces"
- "Wow good effort, you nearly have the bow tying sorted"

### 5. Using Inside Voice Instead of Shouting

**What to notice**: Instances of appropriate volume, can reference past success and invite repetition

**Example phrases**:
- "I noticed you spoke in a beautiful inside voice at grandmas. It was great. Do you think you can you do it again?"
- "I loved eating dinner tonight because everyone used their inside voices and I didn't have to remind anyone about shouting once."

### 6. Tidiness and Personal Responsibility

**What to notice**: Any act of organization or putting things away

**Example phrases**:
- "You did a great job making your bed"
- "I can see you put your shoes away today"

### 7. Staying Close While Shopping

**What to notice**: Walking near parent, holding hands, following safety rules

**Example phrases**:
- "Nice walking next to mum. Shopping was way less stressful today because I knew you were close by"
- "Good job holding mummy's hand as we crossed the road. I liked that."

## Key Implementation Notes

### Scope of Application

This technique applies to:
1. **Targeted behaviours** you are actively trying to change
2. **General positive behaviours** your children are already doing well

### Frequency Principle

**"It's something you can't do too much."** There is no upper limit to how often you should notice positive behaviour. More is better.

### Diagnostic Use

When a problem behaviour emerges or persists, use this as a diagnostic question: "Have I been consistently noticing this child's positive behaviours?" The emergence of problem behaviours often signals a gap in positive reinforcement.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Only noticing internally**: Recognition must be communicated verbally or non-verbally to the child
2. **Waiting for perfect behaviour**: Notice incremental progress and effort, not just complete success
3. **Using flat or neutral tone**: Enthusiasm in delivery matters
4. **Over-focusing on corrections**: The natural parental instinct to guide by pointing out what is wrong undermines behaviour change
5. **Expecting immediate results**: This creates a feedback loop that strengthens over time

## Theoretical Foundation

This technique is grounded in **behavioural psychology** and the principle of **positive reinforcement**: behaviours that receive attention are more likely to be repeated. By strategically directing attention toward desired behaviours (and away from undesired behaviours), parents shape the child's behavioural patterns over time.
