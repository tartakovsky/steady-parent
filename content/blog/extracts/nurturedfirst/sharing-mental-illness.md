# Sharing Mental Health Struggles with Loved Ones: A 7-Step Framework

**Source:** Nurtured First (Jess VanderWier, MA, RP)

## Core Premise: Why Disclosure Matters

**Mental health deserves the same openness as physical health.** The article uses a powerful analogy: if you had a broken leg, you would not hide it from family, avoid doctors out of fear of judgment, or suffer in silence for months. Mental health issues impact lives just as drastically as physical ailments.

**The stigma problem:** Despite equal importance, stigma surrounding mental health causes people to suffer in silence for months or even years. This silence prevents support, accommodation, and proper care.

**The goal:** Open conversation about mental health so everyone can start talking about how mental health issues impact us all in some capacity.

## The 7-Step Framework for Disclosure

### Step 1: Decide Who to Tell

**Key principle:** Sharing mental health struggles is an incredibly intimate and personal thing. The decision of when and who belongs entirely to you.

**Selection criteria:**
- Choose people you love
- Choose people you feel safe with

**Autonomy emphasis:** This should be your decision, not something forced by circumstances or other people's expectations.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Listener for the Conversation

**Why preparation matters:**
- Ensures the conversation actually happens (creates commitment)
- Makes the person aware that sensitive, personal information is coming
- Sets appropriate tone (no joking, no laughing)

**Example preparation statements:**
- "There is something important I wanted to talk to you about, when is a good time to talk?"
- "I want to talk to you about something serious, and I would appreciate if you don't joke or laugh about what I am about to share."
- "I want to show you an article that I read that stood out to me, do you have some time later to talk?"

**Article-sharing technique:** Showing a relevant article can serve as an ice-breaker and help open up the conversation in a less direct, more comfortable way.

### Step 3: Define What Your Struggle Means to You

**Core problem:** Giving a label (e.g., "I have anxiety" or "I feel depressed") does not convey what you are truly going through. Labels are abstract and mean different things to different people.

**Solution:** Be specific about the concrete, lived experience of your struggle.

**Anti-pattern examples and corrections:**

**Instead of "I have anxiety," try:**
- "Whenever I try to leave the house, I get thoughts in my head that tell me something horrible is going to happen and it makes me afraid to leave."
- "I haven't been able to sleep well at night for a few months because of my anxious thoughts, and it is making me feel like I can't make it through the day."

**Instead of "I feel depressed," try:**
- "I have started missing days at work, and I'm worried if I don't get help I won't leave my house."
- "I have a hard time finding the motivation to get out of bed in the morning, and sometimes I stay in bed all day. I feel scared that I won't ever feel like myself again."

**Principle:** Whatever the diagnostic label, translate it into clear, specific terms the listener can understand. This ensures comprehension of what the struggle means specifically to you.

### Step 4: Tell Your Loved One How They Can Support You

**The problem with unguided help:** Family and friends often want to jump in right away and help in their own way, but their approach is not always truly helpful. This creates frustration on both sides.

**Solution:** Proactively explain what you are looking for from them.

**Example support requests:**
- "I know my sleeplessness is causing me to struggle during the day as well as at night. I think I need to talk to a doctor about this, but I am nervous. Could you come with me to an appointment?"
- "I am not allowed to drink alcohol with the medication I am on for my depression. It would be helpful if you can hold me accountable to this when we are out, and offer me support when it is difficult to say no."
- "Sometimes my anxiety makes it really hard for me to go out in social situations. When I step out during our big family event, can you allow me to have a few minutes alone to gather my thoughts?"

**Pattern in examples:**
1. State the specific symptom or challenge
2. Identify the concrete situation where support is needed
3. Make an actionable, specific request

### Step 5: Set Boundaries

**Boundary types to establish:**

**1. Content boundaries (what you share):**
- Only share what you feel comfortable sharing
- It is okay to say: "I am not ready to talk about that right now" or "I'd rather not share that"

**2. Role boundaries (who does what):**
- Loved ones are not qualified counselors or therapists
- They should not be treated as such
- Be clear about when you want advice vs. when you want them to just listen

**3. Response to discrediting:**
- If they try to discredit your struggles, gently remind them that you know yourself best
- Remind them of how they can support you
- Explain how it makes you feel when they discredit your feelings

**Patience requirement:** Everyone comes with their own experiences and opinions. You may need to repeat yourself several times before you reach mutual understanding on boundaries.

**Example boundary-setting statements:**
- "Now that I have explained to you how I feel and how I can be supported, I want to let you know that I do plan to see a therapist and feel confident that I can talk to them about the specifics of my struggle. If you could just check in with me every couple weeks to make sure I am still going to therapy that would be great."
- "It was very difficult for me to bring this up, and when you joke about my struggles that really hurts me. If you could please respect this, and listen to me, I would really appreciate it."

**Pattern in examples:**
1. Acknowledge the vulnerability of sharing
2. Clarify the professional support channel
3. Assign a specific, limited supportive role

### Step 6: Provide Resources

**When you have a diagnosis:** Bring handouts with information about that diagnosis. This helps family and friends develop a deeper understanding of your struggle without relying solely on your explanations.

**When verbal communication is difficult:** Write a letter containing everything you hoped to say. Options for delivery:
- Read the letter to your loved one
- Have them read the letter before you talk

**Benefit:** External resources lend credibility, remove pressure to explain everything yourself, and ensure accurate information transfer.

**Recommended resource:** National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for educational materials on various mental health conditions.

### Step 7: Practice

**What to practice:** All of the previous steps.

**Methods for practicing:**
- Write out what you are going to say
- Practice reading your written script
- Practice with your therapist
- Practice with your doctor
- Practice with a trusted loved one who already knows about your struggles

**Outcome:** Practicing helps you feel confident and ready to have the actual discussion.

## Summary Framework (Condensed)

1. **Decide who** to tell and what to tell them
2. **Prepare your listener** for the conversation
3. **Define what your struggle means** to you (specifics, not labels)
4. **Suggest ways** your loved one can support you
5. **Set boundaries**
6. **Provide resources**
7. **Practice, practice, practice**

## Underlying Principles and Reasoning

**Parity with physical health:** Mental health problems deserve the same treatment, support-seeking, and accommodation as physical ailments.

**Stigma is the barrier:** The main obstacle to getting support is stigma, which causes isolation and silence.

**Specificity creates understanding:** Abstract labels fail to communicate lived experience; concrete descriptions succeed.

**Guided support is effective support:** People want to help but do not know how; directing their efforts prevents frustration and ensures actual benefit.

**Boundaries protect the relationship:** Clear limits on content, role, and appropriate responses preserve both the discloser's wellbeing and the relationship's health.

**Preparation enables success:** Practice and resource-gathering transform a daunting conversation into a manageable one.

## Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Suffering in silence:** Not sharing prevents support and prolongs struggle
- **Using only diagnostic labels:** "I have anxiety" fails to communicate actual experience
- **Letting others help their own way:** Unguided support often misses the mark
- **Treating loved ones as therapists:** They lack qualifications and this strains relationships
- **Sharing without boundaries:** Leads to oversharing, discrediting, or inappropriate responses
- **Going in unprepared:** Reduces confidence and increases likelihood of poor outcomes
