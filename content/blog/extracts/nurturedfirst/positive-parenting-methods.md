# Positive Reinforcement: The Science of Better Behavior in Children

**Source:** Nurtured First (Jess VanderWier, MA, RP)
**Core Principle:** "Catch your child being good" is a scientifically validated method for shaping behavior and building confidence

## The Science of Positive Reinforcement

### Foundational Concept

**Positive reinforcement** is a highly researched behavioral principle demonstrating that human behavior is shaped daily by reinforcement. The mechanism operates through a predictable sequence:

1. **Behavior occurs**
2. **Something is added to the environment** (praise, reward, attention)
3. **Behavior is strengthened** (more likely to recur)

This sequence defines when positive reinforcement has successfully occurred.

### Why It Works

Behavior that receives reinforcement will continue to occur. By deliberately reinforcing desired behaviors, parents can systematically increase their frequency. This approach is:

- Scientifically validated
- Easier on parents than yelling, nagging, or reactive discipline
- Effective at building both better behavior AND child confidence

## Core Mechanism: Positive Opposite Behaviors

### The Framework

Every challenging behavior has a **positive opposite behavior**. The intervention strategy involves:

1. Identify the specific challenging behavior
2. Define what you want the child to do instead (the positive opposite)
3. Reinforce the positive opposite when it occurs

### Examples of Positive Opposites

| Challenging Behavior | Positive Opposite |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Leaving the dinner table early | Sitting nicely at the dinner table |
| Whining and complaining when asking for something | Asking in a respectful tone |
| Hitting while parent is on the phone | Playing quietly while parent is on the phone |

## Implementation Strategies

### 1. Give Genuine, Specific, and Immediate Praise

**Three critical attributes of effective praise:**

- **Genuine:** Children detect false or exaggerated compliments. Authenticity is required.
- **Specific:** Name the exact behavior being praised rather than vague approval.
- **Immediate:** Deliver praise during or immediately after the behavior to ensure correct behavior is reinforced.

**Example format:** "Jess, I love how calmly you are sitting at the table right now, great work!"

### 2. Don't Hold a Grudge

**Warning:** With particularly challenging children, parents may be tempted to say "It's about time!" when appropriate behavior finally occurs.

**Why this backfires:** This response undermines the reinforcement and damages the parent-child connection.

**Correct approach:** When the child engages in appropriate behavior, remain present-focused. Do not reference past misbehavior. Focus entirely on the current positive moment.

### 3. Discover Individual Reinforcers

**Key insight:** Every child finds different things reinforcing. There is no universal reward.

**Action required:** Investigate what excites YOUR specific child, then provide this when they exhibit positive opposite behaviors.

**Potential reinforcers:**
- Playing a specific game together
- Watching a movie
- Going out for hot chocolate
- Talking about their favorite topic (e.g., Paw Patrol)
- Any activity the child finds exciting

### 4. Use Visual Progress Systems

**Token boards and sticker charts** serve two functions:

1. **Behavior change:** Creates structured reinforcement schedule
2. **Confidence building:** Allows child to visually track their own success

**Implementation example:**
- Behavior target: Jean sits through entire dinner without fighting with her brother
- Reward structure: Each successful dinner earns a sticker
- Milestone reward: After 5 stickers, hot chocolate outing with Mom

**Psychological benefit:** Instead of receiving punishment (yelling, room exile), Jean receives confidence-building feedback demonstrating she possesses the skills to behave appropriately.

**Critical implementation note:** Include the child throughout the entire process of creating and using the token board.

**Alternative visual tool:** "First-Then" boards

**Additional creative options:** Pinterest offers many variations including:
- Jars that fill up with each good behavior
- Cards handed out for observed positive behaviors

### 5. Prioritize Parental Self-Care

**Causal chain:** Parental exhaustion leads to ineffective, reactive discipline.

**The problem:** Children with challenging behaviors create parental burnout, exhaustion, and depletion. These states make parents more likely to use ineffective "in the moment" responses.

**The solution:** When parents prioritize their own mental health, they have greater capacity to implement effective behavior strategies consistently.

**Action:** If feeling exhausted and burned out, seek support and help.

## Anti-Patterns: How Positive Reinforcement Backfires

### Accidental Reinforcement of Unwanted Behavior

Without mindfulness about which behaviors receive reinforcement, parents can inadvertently strengthen challenging behaviors.

**Example of accidental reinforcement:**
1. Child hits parent while parent is on the phone (behavior)
2. Parent stops phone call to yell at child (attention added to environment)
3. Next time parent is on the phone, child hits again for attention (behavior strengthened)

**The trap:** The child learned that hitting produces parental attention. Even negative attention (yelling) functions as reinforcement.

### The Negative Attention Cycle

Children recognize that misbehavior often produces more reliable attention than good behavior. They become "smart" about this dynamic and learn that misbehavior gets them what they want (attention) more easily than behaving well.

**Breaking the cycle:** Shift attention allocation. Reduce attention to challenging behaviors while increasing attention to positive behaviors.

## Comparative Advantage Over Traditional Discipline

**Traditional approaches:**
- Yelling
- Nagging
- "In the moment" reactive responses
- Sending to room
- Punishment-focused

**Problems with traditional approaches:**
- Emotionally draining for parents
- May inadvertently reinforce unwanted behavior through attention
- Does not build child confidence
- Does not teach what TO do (only what not to do)

**Positive reinforcement advantages:**
- Less emotionally draining
- Scientifically validated effectiveness
- Builds child confidence
- Shows child they have the skills for appropriate behavior
- Creates positive parent-child interactions

## Broader Applications

**Note:** This exact principle works on adults as well. The behavioral science applies across ages.

## Summary Checklist

1. Give genuine, specific, and immediate praise when the child engages in good behavior
2. Don't hold a grudge when a typically challenging child behaves well
3. Identify what is reinforcing to YOUR specific child
4. Use a sticker or token board to visualize success
5. Take care of yourself to maintain capacity for effective parenting
