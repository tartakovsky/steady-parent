# Understanding a Child's Sensory Needs for Better Sleep

## Core Framework: Sensory Processing and Sleep

Children have unique **sensory preferences** that directly influence their ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. These preferences fall along a spectrum with two primary profiles:

1. **Sensory Seekers** (understimulated children)
2. **Sensory Avoiders** (overstimulated children)

Understanding which profile a child leans toward allows caregivers to tailor the sleep environment and bedtime routine to meet the child's neurological needs.

## Sensory Seekers: The Understimulated Child

### Definition and Characteristics

**Sensory seekers** actively pursue sensory experiences and enjoy intense or stimulating sensations. They have a strong need for sensory input and engage in activities that provide various sensations to fulfill this need.

**What sensory seekers enjoy:**
- Movement activities: jumping, spinning, swinging
- Intense textures, tastes, smells, sounds, and visual stimuli
- Hands-on activities
- Fidget toys or objects with interesting textures
- Strong smells
- Crunchy foods with lots of flavor
- Fuzzy blankets
- Flashing lights and bright colors

**Why they seek these experiences:** These sensations help sensory seekers feel engaged, focused, and satisfied. The input is regulating for their nervous system.

### Sleep Struggle Triggers for Sensory Seekers

Sensory seekers struggle with sleep when:
- They have not had enough movement throughout the day
- They lack sufficient visual stimulation before bed
- Their sleep space is too empty or bare
- They do not have something to fidget or chew on

### Behavioral Signs at Bedtime

**Common bedtime behaviors of sensory-seeking toddlers and preschoolers:**
- Difficulty listening or following instructions
- Trouble staying on task
- Appearing restless, fidgety, or silly
- Having difficulty staying in their bed
- Slamming doors, tossing books off shelves
- Refusal to stay in bed

**Causal chain:** Insufficient movement during the day leads to an unregulated nervous system at night. When sensory seekers are also tired, impulse control decreases further, resulting in dysregulated behaviors.

### Worst-Case Scenarios for Sensory Seekers at Bedtime

Sensory seekers will struggle most when:
- They have spent most of their day sitting (insufficient proprioceptive and vestibular input)
- They are roughhousing or playing a physical game that does not have a clear start and finish before bed (no closure, body stays activated)
- They are being rushed through bedtime or told what to do (removes agency, increases resistance)

### Intervention Strategies for Sensory Seekers

**Sensory-based bedtime routine additions:**

| Sense | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| **Touch** | Rock them in a chair while reading a bedtime story |
| **Smell** | Massage with an aromatic lotion before bed |
| **Taste** | Offer a crunchy or chewy snack before bed |
| **Sound** | Put on a sound that has a clear rhythm (waves, raindrops) |
| **Movement** | Before the bedtime routine, roll them up like a burrito and then press down on them with pillows (deep pressure input) |

**Key principle:** These interventions activate the senses and meet the child's need for movement before sleep, ensuring they are physiologically ready to rest.

## Sensory Avoiders: The Overstimulated Child

### Definition and Characteristics

**Sensory avoiders** have heightened sensitivity to sensory stimuli in their environment. Certain sounds, smells, tastes, textures, or visual stimuli feel overwhelming or uncomfortable. They attempt to avoid or limit exposure to these experiences because they can be distracting, unpleasant, or cause anxiety and distress.

**Preferences of sensory avoiders:**
- Calm and quiet environments
- Specific preferences for clothing, food, and other sensory aspects
- Minimal clutter
- Predictable routines
- Controlled lighting

### Sleep Struggle Triggers for Sensory Avoiders

Sensory avoiders struggle with sleep when:
- They have had a busy day
- They have not had enough time to wind down before bed
- They can feel the tag on their pajamas
- Their sleep space is cluttered

### Behavioral Signs at Bedtime

**Common bedtime behaviors of sensory-avoiding toddlers and preschoolers:**
- Covering ears
- Big meltdowns
- Throwing toys
- Hitting or kicking
- Over-the-top silliness

**Causal chain:** A day of overstimulation combined with tiredness creates a perfect storm. Both factors reduce impulse control and emotional regulation capacity, resulting in explosive or erratic behaviors.

### Worst-Case Scenarios for Sensory Avoiders at Bedtime

Sensory avoiders will struggle most when:
- They have had a busy day at school
- The bedtime routine starts late or is rushed
- Other siblings are being loud or silly
- They have a wet pull-up (tactile irritant)
- The tags on their pajamas are bothering them
- The room is too dark or too bright
- Their bedroom is cluttered with toys
- They have too many stuffed animals in their bed

### Intervention Strategies for Sensory Avoiders

**Environmental and routine modifications:**
- **Implement quiet time before bed:** reading, playing with cars, puzzles
- **Remove tags from pajamas** (tactile irritant elimination)
- **Straighten or remove clutter from the bedroom** (visual calm)
- **Start the bedtime routine 15 minutes earlier** (prevents rushing, allows wind-down)
- **Print a visual bedtime routine** (predictability reduces anxiety)
- **Dim the lights during the bedtime routine** (reduces visual stimulation)

**Key principle:** Simple environmental changes reduce sensory load and allow the child's nervous system to settle into a state conducive to sleep.

## Collaborative Approach: Involving the Child

### Rationale

When caregivers are unsure about a child's specific sensory needs, involving the child in creating their sleep space and routine yields valuable information and increases buy-in.

### Practical Methods for Getting Curious

**Choices to offer the child:**
- Let them choose a toothbrush and the flavor of toothpaste
- Ask if they prefer darkness or a night light
- Let them choose between different types of white noise
- Consult about bed placement (corner of room vs. other locations)
- Include them in selecting pajamas and bed linens

**Questions to assess daily sensory input:**
- "Did you get enough wiggles in today at recess?"
- Questions about their day to gauge how much sensory input they received

### Benefits of This Approach

Inviting the child into the process:
- Helps caregivers make sense of the child's behavior
- Allows proactive meeting of sensory needs
- Prevents pushback, protesting, stalling, and tears at bedtime

## Individual Differences and Adaptation

### Critical Reminder

Every child is unique. What works for one child may not work for another. Strategies require:
- **Trial and error** to identify what works
- **Patience** during the experimentation process
- **Consistency** in applying strategies
- **Adaptability** to modify approaches as needed

### Personal Example from Author

The author (sensory avoider) required:
- An hour of quiet time before bed to wind down
- A straightened room
- Sheets tucked tightly into the mattress
- Particular fabric and fit of pajamas

The author's brother (sensory seeker) required:
- Long physical activity before bed (hockey)
- Loud music
- Rough and tumble play
- Bright purple lights in the room
- Glow-in-the-dark decals on the ceiling
- Would struggle to sleep with too much time indoors or sitting

This contrast illustrates that siblings within the same family can have completely opposite sensory needs.

## Key Takeaways

1. Each child has a **different sensory need** when it comes to sleep
2. **Sensory-seeking children** benefit from movement and stimulation throughout the day and before bedtime
3. **Sensory-avoiding children** may need a quiet and calming bedtime routine to feel settled for sleep; they can struggle after busy days
4. **Involving the child** in creating their sleep space and bedtime routine helps meet their sensory needs
5. **Patience, consistency, and adaptability** are key when finding strategies that work for a child's sleep

## Warning Signs and Anti-Patterns

### For Sensory Seekers
- **Anti-pattern:** Sedentary days followed by immediate bedtime
