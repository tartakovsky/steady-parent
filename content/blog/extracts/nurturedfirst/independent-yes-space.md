# Help Your Baby Explore Independently With The "Yes Space"

Source: Nurtured First (Paige Shiels, October 2021)

## Core Concept

A **"Yes Space"** is a designated area in the home where infants and toddlers can safely crawl, explore, and investigate without danger and without needing constant parental "no" responses. The space allows supervised independent exploration while providing parents with brief respite moments.

## Developmental Foundation

### Why Curiosity Matters

**Curiosity is developmentally normal** for babies and toddlers. Young children:
- Want to explore the world around them
- Do not yet understand what is safe versus unsafe
- Need opportunities to investigate and get curious
- Require environments that support this developmental need

### The Role of Play

**Play is essential for child development** because it contributes to:
- Cognitive wellbeing
- Physical wellbeing
- Social wellbeing
- Emotional wellbeing

**Through play, children:**
- Develop new worlds where they are the leader
- Conquer their fears
- Develop new confidence
- Learn how to regulate their emotions
- Develop critical problem-solving skills

Play is a joy and an amazing part of being a child.

## Two Strategies for Encouraging Curiosity

### Strategy 1: Labeling Safe and Unsafe

Start communicating what is safe and what is not safe even when babies are little. Be direct about what is a "yes" and what is a "no."

**Example Scripts:**
- "I can't let you crawl here; it's not safe. Let me show you why."
- "No, it's not safe to climb the bookshelf, but YES, you can have a book off the shelf to read."

**Key principle:** Pairing a "no" with an alternative "yes" option.

### Strategy 2: Creating a Yes Space

Build a physical environment where exploration is unrestricted and safe.

## How to Create a Yes Space

### Location Options

The yes space can be located in:
- The child's bedroom
- The living room
- The kitchen
- Any other appropriate area of the home

**The space does not have to be fancy.**

### What to Include

**Furniture for pulling up** (if child is at that developmental stage):
- Something soft like a couch
- A heavy ottoman (stable and won't tip)

**Items to avoid:**
- Sharp corners (coffee tables, cabinets)

**Toys and exploration items:**
- Some of the child's favorite toys
- New things for them to explore
- Household objects (some of the best "toys" come from objects found around the house)

### The Critical Test

The most important consideration: **Can you trust your child to explore independently while watching from a distance?**

You should be able to:
- Enjoy a hot coffee
- Read a book
- Tidy up
- Do other brief self-care or household tasks

## The Dual Purpose of a Yes Space

### For the Child

- Provides safe exploration opportunities
- Encourages independent play skills
- Meets the developmental need to be curious and investigate
- Supports cognitive, physical, social, and emotional development

### For the Parent

- Provides a few minutes to yourself
- Allows you to recharge and rest
- Enables sitting on the couch with feet up
- Permits drinking hot coffee, reading, or other self-care

**Critical caveat:** You cannot leave them alone. You still need to keep an eye on them in their space. The independence is for the child's play, not for unsupervised time.

## Invitations to Play

Use the yes space to set up **invitations to play**. This means arranging the environment in a way that invites the child to:
- Explore
- Investigate
- Touch
- Play with objects independently

The environment itself becomes a prompt for engagement without requiring adult-led activity.

## Parent Self-Care Framework

**Foundational principle:** You cannot take care of your child if you are not taking care of yourself.

The yes space serves dual needs simultaneously:
1. Child's need to explore and get curious
2. Parent's need for self-care and brief rest

This reframes creating a yes space not as parental laziness but as necessary self-preservation that enables better caregiving.

## Summary of Benefits

**Child benefits:**
- Safe exploration
- Curiosity satisfaction
- Independent play skill development
- Cognitive, physical, social, and emotional growth through play
- Reduced exposure to constant "no" responses

**Parent benefits:**
- Brief periods of reduced active supervision demands
- Ability to complete household tasks
- Self-care moments (hot drinks, reading, resting)
- Reduced stress from constant vigilance

## Implicit Guidance

### What Makes a Good Yes Space

- Physically safe (no sharp corners, stable furniture)
- Appropriately stimulating (toys, novel objects)
- Contained enough to watch from a distance
- Free from items that require "no" responses
- Matched to child's developmental stage (pulling up furniture if appropriate)

### The Underlying Philosophy

Rather than constantly blocking and redirecting a curious child, redesign the environment so that natural exploration is safe and acceptable. This shifts from reactive parenting (stopping dangerous behavior) to proactive parenting (preventing dangerous situations from arising).
