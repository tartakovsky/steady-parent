## Core Concept

**Parental preference** refers to a child's strong insistence on having one specific parent handle bedtime routines while rejecting the other parent. This phenomenon is extremely common and is NOT an indicator that the child loves one parent more than the other. It is also typically not permanent.

## Common Causes of Parental Preference

### 1. Preference for a Specific Bedtime Style

Children may become attached to the unique way one parent conducts the bedtime routine. Even when the other parent attempts to replicate the routine, subtle differences matter to the child.

**Examples of perceived differences:**
- The octave at which a lullaby is sung
- The character voices used during storybook reading
- The specific sequence or feel of activities

**Causal chain:** Child experiences delight with preferred parent's routine → brain fixates on that experience → desires it every night → protests when non-preferred parent attempts routine → non-preferred parent becomes frustrated or irritable → child fights back harder → craving for preferred parent intensifies

**Anti-pattern:** When the non-preferred parent responds with anger or irritability during the routine, this escalates the child's resistance and deepens the preference cycle.

### 2. Daytime Time Distribution

Two opposite patterns can emerge based on daytime parent exposure:

**Pattern A (Familiarity-based preference):** A child who spends all day with one parent may prefer that same parent at bedtime because their brain is accustomed to spending time with them and craves the routine and comfort established during the day.

**Pattern B (Absence-based preference):** The preferred parent may be the one who is NOT home during the day. The child misses this parent and craves closeness and connection with them after a long day apart.

### 3. Seeking Control (Power Bucket Framework)

**The Power Bucket Metaphor:**
- Imagine each child has a metaphorical bucket labeled "power"
- Throughout the day, every directive given to the child (at home, daycare, or school) removes a drop from their power bucket
- By bedtime, this bucket may be completely empty
- Children with empty power buckets will do whatever it takes to refill them
- Demanding a specific parent at bedtime becomes a mechanism to regain control

**Key insight:** Parental preference in this context is not about love; it is about the child attempting to exercise autonomy and reclaim a sense of agency.

## Four-Step Response Framework

### Step 1: Acknowledge Feelings

**Purpose:** When children feel understood, they do not need to escalate to be heard.

**Rationale:** Children are not trying to be bad or hurt feelings. Their brain is simply stuck on wanting one parent. If they sense they are not understood, they will get louder and louder to ensure they are heard. Welcoming and acknowledging their feelings communicates that they are heard, which can lessen meltdowns and big reactions.

**Script example:**
*"I hear you want Mom to put you to bed. It's my turn tonight. I can handle it if this feels tough for you."*

### Step 2: Set the Boundary

**Core principle:** Even when a child protests and asks for the same parent every night, it is okay to say no.

**Why boundary-holding is powerful:**
- Shows the child that your love does not waver even when they are angry at you
- Helps the child feel safe
- Allows the child to rest in your boundaries (accepting the structure provides security)

**Script example:**
*"Mom can't put you to bed tonight. It is going to be me. I get that it's tough. I know you love that time with Mom."*

### Step 3: Collaborate

**Approach:** Include the child in problem-solving. Get curious about WHY they prefer a specific parent.

**Possible discoveries through collaboration:**
- The preferred parent does something specific that the child enjoys
- The child spends more daytime hours with the preferred parent
- The child needs something special added to the routine with the non-preferred parent

**Script example:**
*"I hear you miss bedtime with Mom. You really like it when Mom puts you to bed. I wonder what it is that you like about Mom putting you to bed. Can you help me understand?"*

### Step 4: Add Playfulness

**Benefits of playfulness:**
- Diffuses tantrums
- Relieves pressure from the situation
- Reduces stress for both parent and child

**Tactics:**
- Use silliness to diffuse the situation
- Create a special handshake or ritual unique to the non-preferred parent
- Demonstrate something fun the preferred parent cannot or does not do

**Script example:**
*"I get it. You only want Mommy. I love spending time with her, too. She's soooo much fun. But can she do this?"* (Make a silly face.)

## Developmental Factors Affecting Duration

There is no exact age when parental preference at bedtime ends, but three developmental milestones influence its resolution:

### 1. Emotional Regulation Development

**Timeline:** Signs of self-regulation typically emerge around ages 5-7.

**Observable progress indicators:**
- Fewer tears when one parent does not perform routines identically to the other
- Shorter tantrums when the preferred parent is unavailable
- Less protesting when the non-preferred parent conducts the routine

**Underlying cause:** Parental preference and resulting tantrums are common in children who have not yet developed skills for emotional regulation. This ability requires time, practice, and neurological development.

### 2. Logical Reasoning Development

**Key insight:** Young children lack the ability to understand logic. Offering explanations or reasoning during emotional moments is ineffective.

**Anti-patterns (unhelpful statements):**
- *"I'm reading the exact same book that mommy reads to you... There's no reason to be upset."*
- *"I don't know all the verses to 'You Are My Sunshine', it's been forever since I've sung the whole song, so how would I know all the words?"*

**Effective alternatives (helpful statements):**
- *"Daddy isn't reading the book the way you like it. I bet mommy does Princess Belle's voice the way you like! Can you show me how she does it?!"*
- *"You are upset because I don't sing the song the same way mommy does. I get that. You love it when mommy sings."*

**Pattern:** Validate the feeling, acknowledge the preference, invite the child to help or explain rather than defending or justifying.

### 3. Tolerating Mixed Feelings (Both-And Thinking)

**Developmental limitation:** Young children cannot hold two feelings simultaneously. They operate as "this or that" thinkers with a one-track mind.

**Examples of this-or-that thinking:**
- "I'm either letting Dad put me to bed, or I'm not going to sleep."
- "Either mom puts me to bed, or I won't feel safe."

**Developmental shift:** Around ages 5-7, children begin tolerating inner conflict and become "both-and" thinkers.

**Examples of both-and thinking:**
- "I'm both upset that my dad can't put me to bed, and understanding that my baby sister needs my mom right now."
- "I can feel scared when mom is away, and safe when dad does the bedtime routine."

**Prediction:** When children demonstrate signs of both-and thinking, parents can anticipate less frequent and less intense parental preference power struggles at bedtime.

## Common Triggers and Context

Parental preference often emerges or intensifies during:
- Birth of a new baby (suddenly the usual parent cannot do bedtime)
- Other major life transitions
- Any disruption to established routines

## Reminders for Parents in Challenging Moments

### What Parental Preference Does NOT Mean

- It does NOT mean you are doing a bad job
- It is NOT a personal attack against you
- It does NOT mean the child loves one parent more than the other

### Reframe for the Non-Preferred Parent

Your child preferring a different parent means your child feels safe enough to:
- Release their big feelings
- Express their desires to you

This safety to express negative emotions is actually a sign of secure attachment, not rejection.

### Temporal Perspective

- This feeling the child has will not last forever
- The phase may feel like it happened overnight
- It may also feel like it will never end
- Neither extreme perception is accurate

### Holding Both Truths

Children are allowed to feel their preference AND parents can still move forward with bedtime. These are not mutually exclusive. The child's right to have feelings does not mean the parent must accommodate the demand.

## Summary of Key Principles

1. **Parental preference at bedtime is common**, especially during major transitions
2. **It does not reflect differential love** for parents
3. **Three main causes:** bedtime style preference, daytime time distribution, seeking control
4. **Four-step response:** Acknowledge feelings → Set boundary → Collaborate → Add playfulness
5. **Boundaries provide safety:** Consistent limits help children feel secure even when upset
6. **Logical reasoning does not work** with young children in emotional states
7. **Developmental resolution** typically occurs around ages 5-7 as emotional regulation, logical reasoning, and both-and thinking emerge
8. **Parent guilt is unnecessary:** The child's protest is not a reflection of parenting quality
