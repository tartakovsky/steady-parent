## Core Premise

Hitting in children is a **communication of unmet needs**, not a reflection of a "bad kid" or parenting failure. One primary cause of hitting is **sensory-related needs**. The child's nervous system is either seeking more sensory input or attempting to escape overwhelming sensory input. Understanding this root cause enables effective, long-term intervention.

## The Nervous System's Role in Hitting

### Sensory Inputs Defined
The five sensory inputs that affect children's regulation:
- Smell
- Noise
- Movement
- Taste
- Textures

### Individual Nervous System Variation
Every child has a **unique nervous system** that requires a specific balance of sensory input to maintain regulation. This variation explains why:
- Some children require lots of movement, noise, and visual stimuli to feel regulated
- Other children are soothed by quiet, slow environments with minimal stimulation
- A child's unique sensory processing style directly impacts their behavior

**Key Insight:** Hitting can be a child's way of communicating their need for either more or less sensory input.

## Diagnostic Framework: Getting Curious About Sensory Needs

### Category 1: Sensory-Seeking Needs

**Definition:** The child's body craves sensory input (particularly through hands) and hitting serves to fulfill this need.

**Diagnostic Questions to Ask Yourself:**
1. Was my child indoors for most of the time before they hit?
2. Was my child sitting for most of the time before they hit?
3. Is my child typically active, restless, and energetic?

**If you answer "yes" to any of these questions:** The child is likely hitting to seek sensory input.

**Example Case (Brody):**
- Profile: Very active child who struggles to sit still, gets restless/bored more quickly than sibling
- Underlying need: Body craves lots of movement and sensory input to achieve internal balance
- Trigger pattern: After long day inside or extended car travel
- Escalation sequence: Whining behaviors appear first (overstimulation signal), then hitting begins if sensory needs remain unmet
- Target: Hits his brother

**Warning Sign:** Whining behaviors are typically the first sign of overstimulation and precede hitting. This is an intervention opportunity.

### Category 2: Sensory-Avoiding Needs

**Definition:** The child is experiencing sensory overload and hitting serves to escape or release this overwhelming feeling.

**Overload Scenario:** Bright lights + loud sounds + frequent physical touch = "too muchness" that child cannot process.

**Diagnostic Questions to Ask Yourself:**
1. Is my child typically sensitive to specific sounds, smells, textures, lights, or tastes?
2. Has my child had enough rest today (a break from demands)?
3. Was my child in a noisy or brightly lit environment before they hit?

**If you answer "yes" to any of these questions:** The child's behavior could be influenced by sensory overload.

**Example Case (Jackson):**
- Profile: More sensitive nervous system, easily overstimulated
- Function of hitting: Communicates "I need a break!"
- Learned pattern: Knows that hitting gets him sent to his room
- **Critical insight:** The hitting serves the purpose of getting his sensory needs met (through removal/isolation). The behavior is functional, not random.

## Three-Step Intervention Strategy

**Important:** Whether the child is hitting to seek or avoid sensory input, the response remains the same. These three strategies work for both sensory profiles.

### Step 1: Connect With the Feeling, Not the Behavior

**Method:** Narrate what you observe about your child's feelings and the situation that preceded hitting.

**Example Script:**
*"You're having a hard time using gentle hands because you were sitting in school all day, and now your body has lots of hitting energy."*

**Why This Works (Multiple Benefits):**
1. **Reduces distress:** Simply naming what's happening can often reduce some of your child's distress
2. **Diminishes behavior's power:** Gives the hitting less power
3. **Builds emotional awareness:** Helps build your child's emotional awareness
4. **Expands vocabulary:** Repeated exposure to narration expands child's emotional vocabulary
5. **Creates feeling of being seen:** Communicates to your child that you truly see them and understand their experience

**Long-Term Outcomes:**
- Child learns to name their emotions before resorting to hitting
- Children who feel seen and heard by caregivers have reduced need for connection-seeking behavior (including hitting)

### Step 2: Set a Boundary

**Core Principle:** Boundaries are one of the most loving ways to protect your child and prepare them to interact with the world effectively.

**Requirements for Effective Boundaries:**
- State boundary in a loving way
- Hold boundary firm
- Must be **high in warmth**

**Example Scripts (Firm + Loving):**
- *"It's okay to be upset, but I can't let you hit me."*
- *"You can cry, but hands are not for hitting."*
- *"I can't let you hit your sister. I'm going to hold your hands to keep our bodies safe."*

**Why Boundaries Are Loving:**

1. **Protection from unwanted actions:** Your child doesn't actually want to hurt their sibling. They have a sensory need and an impulse that needs release. Boundaries protect them from doing something they don't want to do.
   - Internal message: *"I love you so much, I won't let you hit your sister. I know you love your sister, AND you're having a hard time controlling your body."*

2. **Preparation for real-world success:** Hitting won't serve them in the "real world." Setting boundaries prepares them for effective future interactions.
   - Internal message: *"I will prepare you to interact with the world in more helpful ways because I love you so much."*

**Barriers to Setting Loving Boundaries (Parental Background):**

**If your caregivers held harsh standards:** Difficulty viewing boundaries as loving or implementing them in your home.

**If you never had boundaries as a child:** Parents may have ignored behavior or said "Suck it up." You may lack tools for boundary-setting because it was never modeled.

### Step 3: Redirect

**Core Principle:** Address the sensory need beneath the behavior by offering alternative ways to meet that need.

**For Overstimulated Children (Reduce Sensory Input):**
- Move to a quiet corner of the room
- Turn off/down background noise
- Dim the lights

**For Sensory-Seeking Children (Provide Hand Input):**
Redirect to object, activity, or location where they can get the input they're seeking:
- Offer a drum or tambourine to play with
- Clapping repeatedly to the beat of their favorite song
- Bouncing a basketball outside

**Example Redirect Scripts:**
- *"I can't let you hit your sister, but you can use the energy in your hands to give yourself a big squeezy hug!"*
- *"I wonder if your body is saying it needs a break. You can spend some quiet time in your room, or we can make a blanket fort for you to read in."*

**Timing for Redirection:**
Pay attention to pre-hitting cues. Whining behaviors often occur before hitting. When you notice whining, this is the optimal time to shift sensory input or redirect to another environment.

## Anti-Patterns: Ineffective Strategies

The following strategies were explicitly NOT recommended:
- **Ignoring** the behavior
- **Punishments** (including timeouts and spankings)
- **Threats**
- **Bribes**

**Why These Fail:**

1. **Short-term solutions only:** The hitting might stop in the moment, but the root problem (unmet need) remains unaddressed

2. **Problem recurrence:** If the root cause isn't addressed, more hitting will likely occur

3. **Behavior substitution:** Child may shift to different challenging behaviors instead:
   - Lying
   - Screaming
   - Biting
   - Kicking

## Broader Framework: The SEATS Model

Sensory needs are one of five reasons children engage in challenging behaviors. The complete acronym:

- **S** = Sensory needs
- **E** = Escaping (need to avoid/leave a situation)
- **A** = Attention/Connection needs
- **T** = Tangible item or activity (wanting access to something)
- **S** = Stability (need for routine/predictability, often related to recent changes)

**Implication:** If sensory interventions don't resolve hitting, investigate the other four SEATS categories.

## Parent Emotional Responses

### Common Reactions to Child Hitting
- Feeling like a failure as a parent
- Self-questioning ("What am I doing wrong?")
- Shame from judgmental comments from other parents
- Concern from childcare providers

### Common Parental Response Patterns

**Pattern 1: Big Reactions**
- Yelling at child
- Punishing child
- Often driven by feelings and experiences from parent's own childhood

**Pattern 2: Overwhelm Response**
- Ignoring the behavior
- Hoping child will grow out of it

**Reframe:** The child is not "bad" and the parent is not failing. The child is communicating a need.

## Key Causal Chains

1. **Sensory-Seeking Chain:** Extended indoor time/sitting → body craves movement/input → sensory deficit builds → whining (early warning) → hitting (if need unmet)

2. **Sensory-Avoiding Chain:** Overwhelming environment (bright, loud, touch) → "too muchness" feeling → child cannot process → hitting to release/escape

3. **Functional Behavior Chain:** Hitting → consequence (sent to room) → sensory need met (quiet space) → behavior reinforced as effective strategy

4. **Long-Term Learning Chain:** Repeated narration → expanded emotional vocabulary → child names emotions before hitting → reduced hitting over time

5. **Connection Chain:** Child feels seen and heard → reduced need for connection-seeking behaviors → reduced hitting

## Conceptual Hierarchy

**Level 1:** All behavior is communication of unmet needs

**Level 2:** Five categories of needs (SEATS framework)

**Level 3:** Sensory needs divide into two types (seeking vs. avoiding)

**Level 4:** Both types require same three-step response (Connect → Boundary → Redirect)

**Level 5:** Implementation requires parental self-awareness about their own childhood boundary experiences
