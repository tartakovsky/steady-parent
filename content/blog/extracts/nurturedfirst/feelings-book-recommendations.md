## Core Philosophy

**Storytelling as a teaching tool** is positioned as one of the most effective methods for emotional education. Stories function through three distinct mechanisms:

1. **Stories of sameness** from the parent's own childhood (creating connection through shared experience)
2. **Made-up stories** crafted to help children through specific challenging moments (targeted intervention)
3. **Children's books** (structured emotional curriculum)

The author describes storytelling as "magical" in its capacity to reach children.

## Why Books Work for Emotional Development

Books serve three primary functions in emotional development:

1. **Normalization**: Helping children understand their feelings are normal and shared by others
2. **Skill acquisition**: Teaching new coping strategies and techniques
3. **Vocabulary expansion**: Providing words to describe and communicate emotional states

The author notes personal experience using books when her daughter began experiencing "big feelings," suggesting this is an appropriate intervention point.

## Recommended Books with Educational Purpose

### 1. Today I Feel by Madalena Moniz

**Primary function**: Introduction to feelings vocabulary

**Teaching mechanism**: Presents one feeling word per letter of the alphabet, creating an extensive emotional vocabulary set (26 emotions minimum)

**Interactive element**: Concludes by asking children how they feel today, prompting application of newly learned vocabulary

**Best for**: Building emotional vocabulary foundation; giving children words to express themselves

### 2. The Colour Monster by Anna Llenas

**Primary function**: Emotion identification and labeling

**Teaching mechanism**: Uses the narrative device of a confused monster learning to sort and identify different feelings with help from a young girl

**Psychological benefit**: Helps children feel "more in control" through the process of identifying and labeling emotions

**Best for**: Children who experience emotional confusion or overwhelm; teaching that emotions can be distinguished and named

### 3. Breathing Makes It Better by Christopher Willard and Wendy O'Leary

**Primary function**: Teaching breathing as a coping mechanism

**Teaching mechanism**: Presents various situations and feelings, with consistent message to "stop and take a breath" in each scenario

**Practical resources**: Includes breathing exercises and practices at the end for parent-child activities

**Best for**: Active coping skill development; introducing mindfulness techniques; situations where children need calming strategies

### 4. In My Heart by Jo Witek (Illustrated by Christine Roussey)

**Primary function**: Understanding the physical experience of emotions

**Range covered**: Full emotional spectrum from happiness to sadness, shyness to bravery

**Unique approach**: Describes how emotions feel physically "inside our bodies" (interoception)

**Best for**: Children learning to recognize body sensations associated with emotions; building mind-body awareness

### 5. What Do You Say to a Dragon? by Lexi Young Peck (Illustrated by Wendy Leach)

**Primary function**: Addressing fear and anxiety

**Author's assessment**: Listed as "one of my favourite stories" specifically for children struggling with fear and anxiety

**Dual teaching**: Teaches parents tools to support children (not just tools for children directly)

**Narrative structure**: Child wakes scared from nightmare; parents provide tools to face fears; fear (dragon) transforms into friendship

**Key concept**: Fear can be transformed through proper tools and support

**Best for**: Nightmare fears; general anxiety; parent coaching; reframing fear

### 6. The Day You Begin by Jacqueline Woodson (Illustrated by Rafael Lopez)

**Primary function**: Building courage for social connection

**Core theme**: Finding courage to connect when feeling scared and alone

**Normalizing message**: Everyone experiences feelings of fear and isolation sometimes

**Action framework**: Being brave enough to tell your story leads to others listening and connecting

**Best for**: Social anxiety; feelings of isolation or not belonging; building social courage

### 7. You, Me and Empathy by Jayneen Sanders (Illustrated by Sofia Cardoso)

**Primary function**: Teaching empathy

**Prerequisite**: Best for children who already understand their own emotions and are ready to learn about others' emotions

**Teaching mechanism**: Character demonstrates understanding, compassion, and kindness through multiple situations

**Supplementary materials**: Includes discussion questions and activities to promote empathy and kindness

**Developmental progression**: Positioned as a next-level book after self-emotional awareness is established

**Best for**: Children ready to move from self-awareness to other-awareness; building compassion skills

## Implicit Framework for Book Selection

The book list reveals a **developmental progression** in emotional learning:

1. **Vocabulary acquisition** (Today I Feel, In My Heart)
2. **Emotion identification and labeling** (The Colour Monster)
3. **Coping skills** (Breathing Makes It Better)
4. **Facing specific fears** (What Do You Say to a Dragon?)
5. **Social-emotional skills** (The Day You Begin)
6. **Empathy and other-awareness** (You, Me and Empathy)

## Key Principles Embedded in Recommendations

**Normalization is foundational**: Multiple books emphasize that feelings are normal and shared

**Active coping is important**: Books that teach specific strategies (breathing) are valued

**Body awareness matters**: Understanding physical sensations of emotions is a distinct skill

**Parent involvement is crucial**: At least one book explicitly teaches parents how to help

**Empathy requires self-awareness first**: Other-focused emotional skills build on self-understanding

**Vocabulary enables expression**: Without words for feelings, children cannot communicate their emotional states
