## Core Principle

Body safety and consent education should begin in infancy. The foundational purpose is twofold: (1) reduce children's vulnerability to abuse, and (2) establish open communication channels so children feel comfortable reporting concerns. Starting early allows parents to normalize these conversations and overcome their own discomfort before children are old enough to absorb parental awkwardness.

## Age-Specific Teaching Framework

### Stage 1: Babies

**Primary Goal:** Establish parental comfort with body safety language; begin foundational practices.

**Key Strategies:**

1. **Use anatomically correct names from birth**
   - Practice saying terms like "penis" and "vagina" aloud to your baby
   - This normalizes the vocabulary for both parent and child
   - By the time the child is verbal, they will know proper body part names and feel no shame discussing them

2. **Include baby in caregiving processes**
   - Narrate diaper changes and clothing changes
   - This demonstrates respect for the child's body from an early age
   - Acknowledge the baby's feelings during these interactions
   - **Example script:** "Hey buddy, I just need to finish wiping your bum. I can see that you don't want me to do this, but I do need to clean you up to keep you healthy, but I'm almost finished!"

3. **Process your own feelings as the parent**
   - Many parents find body safety education challenging and uncomfortable
   - Give yourself grace during this process
   - Actively work through hesitations and concerns about teaching children about their bodies
   - Your comfort level directly affects your child's comfort level

### Stage 2: Toddlers

**Primary Goal:** Model consent in everyday interactions; establish bodily autonomy.

**Key Strategies:**

1. **Model consent by respecting their "no"**
   - Teaching that "no means no" starts with listening to their own "no"
   - If they refuse a hug, do not force it
   - If they say stop tickling, stop immediately
   - This creates the foundational understanding that refusal must be honored

2. **Give autonomy over physical affection decisions**
   - Children should understand they are "the boss of their bodies"
   - They do not have to hug anyone they do not want to hug
   - **Anti-pattern:** Saying "Give Grandma a hug before we go!" (commands physical affection)
   - **Correct approach:** Ask "Would you like to give Grandma a hug?" and respect a "no" answer
   - **Causal reasoning:** When children are told they must always give hugs, they lose the understanding that they have choice over who touches them, making it harder to recognize when saying "no" is appropriate

3. **Label genitals and private areas explicitly**
   - Include the mouth as a private area alongside genitals
   - Establish the boundary: no one can touch their private parts except:
     - Parents during diaper changing or bathing
     - Sometimes a doctor, but only when parents are present

### Stage 3: Preschoolers and School-Age Children

**Primary Goal:** Deepen understanding; establish safety systems; teach reciprocal consent.

**Key Strategies:**

1. **Invite their questions actively**
   - Preschool-age children have highly curious minds
   - Encourage questions about body safety
   - Provide factual answers to all questions
   - Respond positively to maintain their comfort in asking future questions
   - **Causal chain:** Positive responses to questions → Child feels comfortable → Child continues coming to parent with concerns

2. **Encourage self-care of private areas during bath time**
   - Have children wash their own private areas
   - This builds ownership and agency over their body
   - If parent assistance is needed, ask for the child's consent before washing those areas

3. **Teach the concept of trusted adults**
   - Identify specific people the child can approach for anything
   - These adults serve as safety resources when the child feels:
     - Uncomfortable
     - Nervous
     - Scared
     - Hurt
   - Child should know these trusted adults will help them unconditionally

4. **Implement a "no secrets" home policy**
   - Establish the rule: nobody should ever tell the child to keep a secret
   - Child must know they can always come to parents if anything makes them feel uncomfortable, nervous, or scared
   - This removes the common tool abusers use (demanding secrecy)

5. **Teach reciprocal consent with peers**
   - Children must understand consent applies both ways
   - They must ask permission before touching playmates
   - Use narration to reinforce this in real time
   - **Example scripts:**
     - "I heard Tommy say no more hugs. When he says no, we stop trying to hug him right away."
     - "I noticed how you listened when Tommy said no more hugs and gave him a high five instead!" (positive reinforcement)

## The Critical Importance of Anatomically Correct Names

### Why Parents Avoid Correct Terms

- Discomfort with words like "penis" and "vagina"
- Default to euphemisms ("pee-pee") or complete avoidance

### Three Protective Functions of Using Correct Terms

**1. Removes Shame**
- Demonstrates that discussing body parts carries no shame
- Makes children more likely to report both medical concerns and abuse
- **Causal chain:** Avoiding proper names or using silly words → Child internalizes that body parts are shameful/taboo → Child becomes afraid to speak up if something happens involving private parts

**2. Reduces Vulnerability to Abuse**
- Studies show children who know anatomically correct names are at decreased risk for abuse
- **Proposed mechanisms:**
  - Abusers recognize the child has vocabulary to clearly report what occurred
  - Abusers know the child will be understood if they report
  - Clear reporting language helps ensure proper legal charges against abusers

**3. Enables Clear Boundary Setting**
- When teaching correct names, simultaneously teach that these parts are private
- Establish clear rule: nobody else should touch private parts except:
  - A parent during changing or bathing
  - A doctor when a parent is present

## Storytelling as a Teaching Tool

### Why Storytelling Works

- Most children relate easily to stories
- Stories help children trust their internal instincts
- Stories reinforce that children are in charge of their bodies
- Described as "one of my favourite tools" and "so powerful"

### How to Use Storytelling for Body Safety

Create brief narratives about real situations the child experiences. These narratives:
- Validate the child's instincts and choices
- Reinforce that their refusals were respected
- Model appropriate responses to others' boundaries

### Example Storytelling Scripts

**Respecting the child's refusal:**
"I asked for a hug and noticed you looking away from me. I see you don't want a hug, and that's ok."

**Adult modeling consent:**
"Papa wanted to hold your hand as we walked to the park, and you said no and asked him to walk beside you instead. Papa walked beside you and listened to your no."

**Child respecting peer's boundaries:**
"You wanted to hug your friend, but she pulled away and said no. I love how you were ok with a fist bump instead."

## Summary of Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Correct Alternative |
|--------------|---------|---------------------|
| Commanding physical affection ("Give Grandma a hug!") | Removes child's sense of bodily choice | Ask and respect the answer |
| Using euphemisms for body parts | Creates shame, reduces reporting, unclear language | Use anatomically correct names |
| Ignoring child's "no" during play/affection | Teaches that "no" can be overridden | Stop immediately when child says no |
| Not processing your own discomfort | Transmits awkwardness to child | Work through feelings privately first |
| Allowing secrets | Gives abusers a tool | Implement "no secrets" policy |

## Key Protective Outcomes

When body safety education is implemented correctly:
- Children have language to report abuse clearly
- Children feel no shame in discussing body-related concerns
- Children understand they control who touches them
- Children know multiple trusted adults to approach
- Children understand that secrets about touching are never acceptable
- Children apply consent principles both ways (receiving and giving)
- Vulnerability to abuse is reduced
- If abuse occurs, children are more likely to report and can provide clear testimony
