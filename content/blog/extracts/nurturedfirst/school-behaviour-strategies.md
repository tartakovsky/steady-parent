# How To Work With Teachers On School Behaviour Challenges

## Core Premise

School misbehaviour often traps children in counterproductive cycles. The example case illustrates this: Tom, an active third-grader who struggles to sit still, loses recess privileges as punishment. Losing recess (his movement outlet) makes sitting still even harder, leading to more disruptive behaviour, which escalates to principal's office visits. Breaking this cycle requires understanding root causes and parent-teacher collaboration.

## Foundational Concept: Behaviour Is Communication

**Key principle:** Children do not misbehave to be "bad" or to manipulate teachers. Behaviour communicates a deeper unmet need.

### Categories of Underlying Needs

- **Connection and attention**
- **Physical needs:** hunger, illness, pain, fatigue
- **Movement needs**
- **Rest requirements**
- **Release of feelings**

### Common Reasons for School Misbehaviour

1. **Boundary testing:** Exploring what happens when rules are pushed
2. **Insecurities or lack of confidence**
3. **Peer influence:** Copying classmates' behaviour
4. **Physical discomfort:** Hunger, illness, pain, or fatigue
5. **Emotional regulation deficits:** Lacking skills to manage feelings
6. **Autonomy seeking:** Desire for more control and independence
7. **Relationship conflicts:** Issues with parents or friends affecting behaviour
8. **Learning or attention difficulties:** Underlying cognitive factors

### Decoding Behaviour: What the Child Might Be Communicating

Using Tom as example, fidgeting and silliness might express:
- Curiosity exploration ("I wonder what will happen if I tap this pencil")
- Environmental distraction ("I wonder what's going on outside")
- Uncontrollable impulses ("I need to giggle, and I can't control it")
- Social experimentation ("I wonder what my friends will do if I make a silly noise")
- Physical discomfort with expectations ("Sitting at this desk is hard; I just want to play")

## Information Gathering Framework

### Anti-Pattern: Premature Conclusions

Do not jump to conclusions or make assumptions about your child or their teachers before gathering adequate information from both parties.

### Gathering Information From Teachers

**Step 1: Initiate communication properly**
- Schedule meetings outside school hours
- Purpose: keeps communication open, honest, and confidential
- Avoids rushed conversations during pickup/dropoff

**Step 2: Prepare specific questions in advance**
Specificity enables teachers to provide useful information. Key questions to ask:

- Are the boundaries in the classroom consistent and clear?
- Have there been any social issues with classmates or friends?
- Are there opportunities for autonomy throughout the day?
- Is my child getting enough rest and movement throughout the day?

### Gathering Information From Your Child

**Core approach:** Calm, compassion, and curiosity

**1. Regulate yourself first**
- If feeling too emotional, wait until calm before approaching your child
- Your emotional state affects the quality of information you receive

**2. Lead with compassion**
- Remember: children are human and worthy of respect
- Draw on your own school experiences to build empathy

**Compassion script examples:**
- "You were having a really tough day. I know what that's like. I have days like that, too."
- "It can be really hard to listen all day at school. I know how hard that feels."
- "When I was in school, sometimes I had so much energy it made it hard to sit and be quiet."

**3. Use curiosity instead of assumptions**

**Anti-pattern:** Statements that assume, blame, or shame

**Correct approach:** Get curious with open-ended questions

**Curiosity script examples:**
- "I heard you were having a hard time listening in class today. What's up?"
- "I wonder why you've been struggling to sit in class? Help me understand."

## Five-Step Collaboration Framework

### Success Criterion
The best solution feels good for all three parties: parent, child, and school staff.

### Step 1: Clarifying the Issue

Each party must be clear about two elements:
- **What is the specific behaviour?** (Observable actions, not interpretations)
- **What has been the impact of this behaviour?**

**Example (Tom's case):**
- Specific behaviours: taps pencil on desk, fidgets, looks out window, talks to students during lessons, speaks out of turn, gets out of seat, acts silly
- Impact: prevents him from completing work, distracts other students

### Step 2: Establishing Desired Outcomes

Each party states their ideal outcome. This creates shared understanding of goals.

**Example:**
- Teacher's desired outcome: Tom stays seated during class, focuses on work, doesn't disrupt other students
- Parents' desired outcome: Tom focuses better so he learns and doesn't fall behind academically

### Step 3: Communicate Possible Solutions

Each party proposes solutions based on their understanding of the behaviour.

**Example:**
- Teacher's suggestion: Seat Tom away from windows and separate from classmates (addresses distraction)
- Parents' suggestion: Give Tom active classroom role like teacher's helper (addresses movement needs)

### Step 4: Address Questions and Concerns

Both parties voice concerns about the other party's suggestions. This prevents resentment and surfaces important considerations.

**Example:**
- Teacher's concern about parent suggestion: Making Tom teacher's helper may seem unfair to other students
- Parent's concern about teacher suggestion: Separating Tom may make him feel excluded or isolated

### Step 5: Reach Compromise

**Guiding question:** What is fair and realistic for everyone (child, other students, teachers, and parents)?

**Example compromise:** Regular, scheduled movement breaks for the whole class

**Implementation details:**
- "Wiggle breaks" scheduled throughout the day
- Clear start and finish times so students know what to expect
- Benefits Tom, benefits teachers (easier classroom management), benefits other students (they also get movement)

## Reinforcing Progress

### Principle: Notice and Celebrate Growth

When progress occurs, explicitly acknowledge improvement. This applies at both home and school settings.

### "Noticing the Good" Script Examples

- "I love how you came to me when you needed a break instead of shouting." (Acknowledges self-regulation improvement)
- "Thank you for being patient. I know it was hard for you to sit still." (Validates effort and difficulty)
- "Your teacher said you raised your hand every time you wanted to speak today!" (Connects home and school acknowledgment)

## Meta-Lesson: Modeling Conflict Resolution

**Key insight:** How parents navigate school behaviour situations models conflict resolution for the child.

**Teaching opportunities embedded in the process:**
- How to approach tricky topics
- How to ask good questions
- How to respond with compassion
- How to collaborate with others

The resolution process itself becomes a teaching moment about healthy problem-solving.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Patience required:** Getting to root causes and collaborating takes time
2. **Compromise necessary:** No party gets everything they want
3. **Simplicity possible:** The process doesn't need to be complicated despite requiring effort
4. **Cycle awareness:** Watch for punishment patterns that worsen underlying problems (removing recess from movement-hungry child)
5. **Specificity matters:** Vague concerns produce vague responses; specific questions enable targeted solutions
6. **Solutions should benefit multiple parties:** The best compromises help the child, the class, and the teacher

## Warning Signs of Counterproductive Approaches

- Removing physical outlets (recess, movement) as punishment for movement-related behaviour
- Isolating children in ways that create emotional harm
- Solutions that address symptoms without addressing underlying needs
- Assumptions made before gathering information from all parties
- Approaching child from place of heightened emotion
- Using blame or shame language when questioning child
