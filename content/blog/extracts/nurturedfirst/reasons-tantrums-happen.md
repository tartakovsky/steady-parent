## Core Thesis

Tantrums are not misbehavior requiring punishment. They are a **developmentally normal and important** part of childhood. Understanding the science behind tantrums transforms how caregivers perceive and respond to their children. When parents understand tantrums as developmental necessities rather than behavioral problems, they shift from seeking punishment to viewing tantrums as **teaching opportunities**.

## Reason 1: Brain Development Is Incomplete

### The Two-Brain Framework

**Logical Brain (Prefrontal Cortex)**
- Responsible for logical thinking and emotional regulation
- Children must access logical thinking to regulate emotions
- **Development timeline:** Does not begin developing until ages 5 to 7 years
- For some children, development starts even later at ages 8 to 9
- This explains why children under 5 (babies, toddlers, preschoolers) are especially impulsive, emotional, and illogical
- Young children literally cannot access logical thinking because this brain region is under active construction

**Emotional Brain (Amygdala)**
- Responsible for automatic functions: breathing, blinking, danger response
- Handles emotions including fear, anxiety, worry, shame, and anger
- **Fully developed at birth**
- Drives all of a toddler's big feelings

### Cognitive Imbalance Explanation

The fundamental problem: children have a fully operational emotional brain generating intense feelings, but lack the logical brain capacity to regulate those feelings. This imbalance is the neurological basis of tantrums.

### Cognitive Development by Age

**Ages 1 to 2 Years**
- Express frustration when demands are not met
- Tantrums occur when others interfere with activities
- Possessive of items
- Emotional outbursts when unable to articulate wants or needs
- Increasingly assert independence
- Often refuse to cooperate
- Tantrums when tired or frustrated

**Ages 2 to 3 Years**
- Frequently test limits
- Say "no" often
- Frequently assert independence
- May use physical aggression when frustrated or angry
- Impatient; difficulty taking turns or waiting

**Ages 3 to 4 Years**
- Insist on doing things independently
- Tantrums when things do not go their way
- Often test boundaries
- Inflexible; upset when routine changes
- Frequent verbal and physical pushback
- Difficulty coping when things do not go their way

**Ages 5 to 7 Years**
- Increase in ability to control impulses
- Talk self through simple problem solving
- Generally cooperative with caregivers
- Increased frustration tolerance
- Generally able to participate in group activities and turn taking
- Starting to understand cause and effect
- Able to control emotions better
- Periodic mood swings
- Easily disappointed and frustrated with self
- Difficulty seeing others' perspectives
- Difficulty determining moral standards; rely on rules
- Increasing fears (the dark, strange noises, animals)

**Ages 8 to 9 Years**
- Ability to solve more complex problems
- Can think through things logically
- Ability to recognize others' perspectives
- Ability to communicate feelings
- Effective coping skills for anger and frustration
- Understand the effect of behavior on others

**Important Note:** These are general guidelines. Some children meet milestones earlier or later. **Highly sensitive children often reach milestones later.**

## Reason 2: Emotional Awareness and Regulation Are Still Developing

### Definition of Emotional Development

**Emotional development** is the process of learning to:
1. Understand your feelings
2. Understand why feelings occur
3. Cope with feelings

This is also called **emotional awareness**, **emotional intelligence**, or **emotional regulation**.

### Timeline

Toddlers and preschoolers have not developed emotional awareness or emotional regulation skills. This development does not begin until ages 5 to 7. Until then, **caregivers must lend children their calm**.

### Manifestation 1: Boundaries Trigger Bigger Tantrums

**Why children test limits:**
- Toddlers and preschoolers are "little scientists" driven by curiosity
- Testing limits helps them make sense of their world
- Testing reveals who to trust, what to trust, and consequences of actions
- Exploration meets emotional needs by connecting children to their environment

**Why boundaries cause tantrums:**
- Limits feel frustrating because children cannot understand why limits exist
- The reasoning part of the brain is still under construction
- Children want to be in charge
- They want to do what they want when they want to do it

**Example thought process of a toddler:** "I want to throw this macaroni off the highchair and see what happens. I wonder what my parents will do. This is so cool!"

**What happens:** When a boundary is set ("food isn't for throwing" or "food stays on the tray"), it triggers a tantrum because the toddler is not emotionally developed enough to understand the boundary or why it is necessary.

### Manifestation 2: Tantrums as Communication

Without emotional awareness and intelligence, toddlers and preschoolers struggle to communicate their feelings. **Tantrums serve as a method to:**
- Release pent-up emotions
- Draw caregiver attention
- Get needs met

**What tantrums may be communicating:**
- "I'm feeling angry because my brother took my toy!"
- "I'm feeling disconnected from my parents, and I need more time with them!"
- "I'm feeling overstimulated, and I need a break!"

## Reason 3: Physical States (Tired, Hungry, Overstimulated)

### Key Insight

Adults also have their own version of tantrums when tired, hungry, or overstimulated. Children simply lack the capacity to manage these states.

### Tantrums When Tired

- Similar to how parents get grumpy, irritable, annoyed, or easily frustrated when tired
- When overtired, children have harder time controlling impulses
- Leads to more tantrums
- Lack of impulse control contributes to impulsive actions like hitting siblings during tantrums
- **Practical insight:** A rested child will be much less likely to have tantrums

### Tantrums When Hungry ("Hangry")

- Children can go from 0 to 100 right before meal times
- Low blood sugar causes:
  - Decreased energy
  - Harder time controlling emotions
  - Harder time controlling impulsive behavior
- **Practical solution:** Providing filling snacks between meals can significantly help with tantrums

### Tantrums When Overstimulated

- Occur on busy days or when environment has many lights and sounds
- Overstimulation creates a sense of "too muchness" in the body
- All the lights, sounds, and activity feel like too much
- Child needs to release this "too much" feeling through a tantrum

### Special Population Note

**Highly sensitive children** experience fatigue, hunger, and overstimulation much more frequently and intensely than other children.

## Reason 4: Environmental Chaos

The environment surrounding a toddler influences the **frequency and intensity** of outbursts. Chaotic environments are challenging for children to navigate and produce more intense tantrums.

### Type 1: Chaos in Routine

**Why routines matter:**
- Children thrive in predictable environments
- Predictability gives children a sense of control

**Triggers for routine chaos:**
- Disrupted nap schedule
- Parent traveling for work
- Moving to a new home
- Adding a new baby

**How children respond:**
- Tantrums occur when children struggle to adapt to new situations
- Tantrums represent attempts to regain sense of control and predictability

**Specific situations causing increased tantrum intensity and frequency:**
- New baby arrives, changing the morning routine
- Moving to a new home, so toys are not in their usual spot
- Caregivers separate or divorce, so child spends time in two different homes
- Caregiver away for work, so bedtime environment feels different
- Loss of a loved one or relationship, so someone is unable to visit

### Type 2: Chaos in Caregiving

**What creates caregiving chaos:**
- No clear rules or boundaries in place
- Different rules between a child's caregivers
- Child does not know what to expect

**Example demonstrating the problem (child hitting):**

| Environment | Response to Hitting |
|------------|---------------------|
| Grandparent's House | "Don't hit your sister!" Grandparent spanks the child. |
| Preschool | "We don't hit each other in this class." Child is sent to time-out. |
| Home | "You're having a hard time keeping your hands to yourself. I will hold them till you can use them more gently." Parent gently holds child's hands. |

**Result:** Three different responses for the same behavior is extremely confusing for a child. Different expectations and reactions feel chaotic. When toddlers and preschoolers feel lost, they burst with emotion.

## Implications and Applications

### Implication 1: Tantrums Help Children Cope

**Functions of tantrums:**
- Important part of emotional development
- Temporary release of pent-up emotions
- Unique way to communicate distress
- Method to get support from trusted caregivers

**Long-term benefits:**
- Help children gain understanding and awareness of their feelings
- Lay foundation for emotional intelligence
- Build resilience

**Caregiver responsibility:** While children need to release big feelings, caregivers should also teach more effective ways to express emotions and cope. **The optimal teaching moment is after a tantrum, when the child is calm.**

### Implication 2: Responding to the Question "Should I Just Let Tantrums Happen?"

**If tantrums are developmentally normal and necessary, should caregivers just let children cry and cry?**

**The caregiver's job:**
- Allow children to experience their feelings
- Say "yes" to their feelings
- Allow them to release their tears
- This helps children move forward
- Teaches children that the caregiver is a safe, trusted person to come to with all feelings

**Critical caveat about boundaries:**
- Children's brains cannot control impulses when upset
- Children need caregivers to step in and help when they are hitting, biting, or kicking
- **Boundaries around behavior are necessary** even while validating feelings
- Set boundaries around behavior, not around feelings

### Implication 3: Reframe Your View of the Child

**Core mindset shift:** Your child is not bad. They are a good child having a hard time.

When a tantrum happens over something seemingly absurd (the bath is too wet, the blanket is too fuzzy), consider:
- Developmental factors (brain immaturity)
- Emotional factors (still learning regulation)
- Physiological factors (tired, hungry, overstimulated)
- Environmental factors (chaos in routine or caregiving)

Understanding these reasons helps parents respond **more effectively and compassionately** to their children's needs.

## Key Takeaways (Summary)

1. Tantrums are not bad; they are an important part of child development
2. Toddlers and preschoolers have an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex (logical brain), making them impulsive, emotional, and illogical. Ability to regulate emotions and think logically does not start developing until ages 5 to 9
3. Young children are still learning to recognize, understand, and cope with feelings. Tantrums occur when they struggle to articulate needs
4. Tantrums often happen when a child is tired, hungry, or overstimulated
5. Changes in routine, chaotic environment, or inconsistent rules and boundaries make children feel out of control, resulting in more tantrums
6. Tantrums allow children to release pent-up emotions, signaling they need support from caregivers
7. While essential to let children experience feelings, boundaries are necessary when actions involve hurting others or themselves. Parents should step in and set boundaries in these situations
8. Your child is a good child who is having a hard time

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Punishing tantrums** - Punishment does not address the root cause (brain development) and teaches children that big emotions are bad
2. **Viewing tantrums as misbehavior** - This framing leads to inappropriate responses
3. **Expecting logic from children under 5** - The logical brain is not developed
4. **Inconsistent responses across caregivers** - Creates chaos and confusion
5. **Ignoring physical states** - Failing to address tiredness, hunger, or overstimulation
6. **Suppressing feelings** - Saying no to feelings teaches children the caregiver is not safe for emotional expression
7. **Failing to set behavioral boundaries** - Allowing hitting, biting, kicking during tantrums without intervention

## Causal Chain Summary

**Neurological cause:** Fully developed emotional brain + underdeveloped logical brain = inability to regulate emotions

**Emotional cause:** Lack of emotional awareness and regulation skills = tantrums as communication and release

**Physical cause:** Tired, hungry, or overstimulated states = reduced impulse control and increased tantrums

**Environmental cause:** Unpredictable routines or inconsistent caregiving = feelings of chaos and loss of control = more frequent and intense tantrums

**Appropriate response:** Caregiver calm (not punishment) + validation of feelings + boundaries on behavior = teaching opportunity for emotional development
