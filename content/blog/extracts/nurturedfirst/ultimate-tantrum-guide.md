## Core Understanding: What Tantrums Are

**Tantrums are communication.** They represent a child's way of expressing unmet needs when they lack the skills to articulate them verbally or handle them internally.

### What a Tantrum May Communicate

- Hunger
- Need for a break
- Desire for a specific object
- Feeling stuck and needing help
- Overwhelm

### Why Tantrums Happen (Neurological Basis)

**The toddler/preschooler brain lacks the capacity for reasoning and logical thinking.** Children at this age cannot:

- Recognize hunger and then request food
- Identify need for rest and then take a break
- Accept delayed gratification (wanting a toy but understanding they can have it later)
- Recognize overwhelm and apply self-regulation techniques (like deep breathing)

**Key developmental deficits driving tantrums:**

1. **Lack of emotional awareness** (cannot identify what they are feeling)
2. **Lack of emotional intelligence** (cannot understand or process feelings)
3. **Absence of self-regulation skills** (cannot manage emotional states)
4. **Limited impulse control** (act on emotions rather than thought)

**Tantrums signal two things simultaneously:**
1. A child has an unmet need
2. A child is missing skills to meet that need effectively

### The Function of Tantrums

Tantrums serve multiple purposes:

- **Release mechanism:** A discharge of accumulated confusion, frustration, sadness, anger, and anxiety
- **Attention-seeking (legitimate):** A way to get caregiver attention so needs can be met
- **Coping strategy:** This is the only method the child knows for dealing with feelings

## Caregiver Response: The Critical Role of Staying Calm

### Why Caregiver Calm Matters

Since children cannot regulate their own emotions, they require a calm caregiver to **"lend" them calm**. The caregiver's regulated state becomes a resource the child can borrow during dysregulation.

### Why Staying Calm Is Difficult

This is identified as **one of the most difficult parts of raising toddlers and preschoolers.** Difficulty increases if the caregiver:

- Was not taught emotional coping skills as a child
- Has not developed emotional coping skills as an adult

### Four Strategies for Maintaining Calm During Tantrums

**1. Acknowledge Your Emotions**

Naming your emotional state removes some of its power.

**Script:** "I'm feeling frustrated. And that is okay."

**2. Use a Calming Tool**

Have a pre-planned intervention ready:

- Deep breathing exercise
- Grounding statement

**Script example:** "This moment is really tough, but it will pass."

**3. Connect With Other Parents**

Parenting is triggering and isolating, especially when dealing with children who have big feelings. Community support is strongly recommended.

**4. Set Realistic Goals**

**Key insight:** Every parent will have moments of overwhelm. Expecting perfection is unfair.

**Process for imperfection:**
1. Acknowledge imperfections
2. Make room for mistakes
3. Prepare for them in advance

**The repair opportunity:** When you lose your cool, use it to model responsibility and relationship repair.

**Script:** "I don't like how I reacted. Can we start over?"

This teaches children about taking responsibility and nurtures the relationship through the rupture-repair cycle.

## Why Ignoring Tantrums Fails

### Common Misconception

Many parents believe ignoring tantrums is the only way to stop them. The underlying fear is that acknowledging a tantruming child equals "giving in" and signals that the behavior is acceptable.

### Three Reasons Ignoring Does Not Work

**1. Children lack the ability to self-regulate**

Leaving them alone to "figure it out" is developmentally inappropriate. Ignoring:
- Does not provide tools or skills
- Sends the message that their feelings are "too much" for caregivers

**2. Ignoring damages emotional health and relationships**

When left alone with feelings, children internalize harmful messages:
- "My feelings are too much"
- "I need to stop having these feelings"
- "I can only get my caregiver's attention when I'm calm"

**3. Ignoring does not address root causes**

The child may stop crying (surface behavior change), but without addressing underlying needs, the tantrum will recur. This is a **short-term solution only**.

### The Alternative: Emotion Coaching

**Definition:** Emotion coaching involves acknowledging and validating a child's emotions.

**The 3-Step Framework:**
1. **Sportscast** (describe what you observe)
2. **Wait** (give space)
3. **Connect** (engage emotionally)

## Special Population: Highly Sensitive Children

### Characteristics

Highly sensitive children experience:
- **More frequent tantrums**
- **More intense tantrums**
- **Deep sensitivity** to lights, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures
- **Easier overstimulation**

### Behavioral Manifestation

Highly sensitive children often appear **strong-willed**. This is a protective mechanism:
- Demanding preferences protects them from painful sensory input
- Resistance serves as self-protection from overwhelm

**Example:** A child seeming demanding at dinner may actually be overwhelmed by the casserole's smells, tastes, and textures.

### Important Clarification

Acknowledging sensitivity does NOT mean:
- Giving in to demands
- Letting the child be in control

It DOES mean:
- Changing your approach
- Reconsidering how you respond during tantrums

### Three Response Strategies for Highly Sensitive Children

**1. Nurture the Relationship**

Scripts:
- "You can be upset that Daddy's leaving for work. I'm here for you."
- "I shouldn't have yelled when you threw your lasagna on the floor. That's not how I wanted to talk to you."

**2. Acknowledge the Depth of Their Feelings**

Scripts:
- "You're so upset that macaroni isn't on the menu. You really don't like the taste or smell of the lasagna."
- "You threw the lasagna on the ground because you wanted me to know it felt really tricky for you to eat it."

**3. Set Clear and Reliable Boundaries**

Scripts:
- "You can be upset about the menu, but I can't let you throw your food."
- "Food is not for throwing. Let's clean it up together."

**Note:** Boundaries remain firm even while feelings are acknowledged.

## Public Tantrums: Environmental Triggers and Management

### Why Public Spaces Trigger Tantrums

Toddlers are wired to:
- Explore their environment
- Feel in control

Public places violate both needs:
- Exploration is restricted
- Unpredictability is high

### Common Public Tantrum Triggers

- Seeing toys they cannot touch (mall)
- Hunger combined with required stillness (restaurant)
- Sensory overwhelm from lights, smells, noises, and people (grocery store)
- Extended sun exposure (beach)
- Transitions away from enjoyable activities (playground to car)

### Three Strategies for Public Tantrum Management

**1. Prepare for the Unexpected**

Do not wait for tantrums; anticipate them.

**Examples:**
- Pack snacks for the mall
- Bring sensory toys to restaurants

**2. Tell Your Child the Plan Ahead of Time**

Provide predictability to counter environmental unpredictability.

**Script:** "We're going to go to the park for 15 minutes, and then we'll go back home. I'll set a timer when you have 5 minutes left to play!"

**3. Offer a Creative Yes When Possible**

Give the child a sense of control within limits.

**Script:** "You can't have french fries right now, but you can have something to eat. Would you like some crackers or a granola bar?"

## Play as a Tantrum Intervention Tool

### Foundational Principle: Play Is a Toddler's Language

Play provides access to the child's internal world when verbal communication fails.

**Example application:** At bedtime tantrums, instead of demanding explanations ("Stop crying! I don't understand what's wrong!"), use the child's favorite stuffed animal.

**Script:** "Hmmm, I need your help. Mrs. Cheetah is upset. She cries a lot before bed. What do you think she needs?"

### Play Shifts Attention

Playfulness can redirect a child away from the emotional spiral.

**Techniques:**
- Silly faces
- Noises
- Songs

**Example:** Child refuses to brush teeth.

**Script:** "You're upset because you don't want to brush your teeth, but how will we get all the little bugs out of your mouth?"

### Play Helps Children Make Sense of Their World

Role-play allows children to build confidence for challenging situations.

**Example:** Struggling with preschool transition.

**Script:** "Let's pretend I'm going to preschool. Do you want to be the parent who drops me off or the teacher waiting in the classroom?"

**Method:**
1. Adult acts out the scared preschooler role, demonstrating coping strategies
2. Switch places so child practices the scenario

### Play Develops Skills

Play exposes children to new ideas, concepts, and situations. It builds:
- Critical thinking
- Problem-solving
- Communication

**Example:** For impulse control difficulties, play games like "What Time Is It Mr. Wolf" to practice controlling urges in a playful context.

### Play Is Nurturing

Play provides:
- Developmental growth
- Connection opportunities

## Reframing Tantrums: Opportunities for Connection

### The Mindset Shift

Once parents understand tantrums and acquire navigation tools, negative feelings (confusion, stress, frustration, embarrassment) decrease. Confidence increases.

**Outcomes of increased confidence:**
- Ability to calmly sit with a crying toddler
- Courage to bring a preschooler to restaurants
- Deeper connection with the child

### Why Tantrums Can Be Valued

Every tantrum is an **opportunity for connection and nurture**. Each occurrence where the caregiver:
- Shows up
- Sits with the child during big feelings
- Holds them while they cry
- Role-plays tricky situations
- Shows empathy during struggles
- Offers new tools

...is actively **nurturing the relationship**.

## Key Warnings

- Ignoring tantrums damages emotional health, well-being, and caregiver relationships
- Children left alone with feelings learn their feelings are "too much"
- Short-term behavioral suppression does not equal long-term skill development
- Lack of caregiver emotional tools from childhood makes staying calm harder
- Surface behavior change (stopping crying) does not indicate need resolution
