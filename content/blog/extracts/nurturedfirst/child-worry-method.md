# The PAUSE Method: A 5-Step Approach to Help Children Manage Anxiety

**Source:** Nurtured First (Jess VanderWier, MA, RP)
**Applicable Ages:** Toddler, Preschooler, Big Kid

## Core Problem

Parents naturally want children to be happy and carefree. When a child experiences anxiety, parents instinctively try to reason with them, explain why worries are unfounded, or reassure them they are safe. However, **logical explanations do not work during anxious episodes**.

## The Neuroscience of Childhood Anxiety

During anxiety, the brain undergoes a **rapid dump of survival chemicals**. This triggers a specific neurological response:

1. The **prefrontal cortex** (logical reasoning center) goes on hold
2. The **emotional brain** takes over control
3. The child becomes neurologically incapable of processing logical arguments

**Key insight:** When a child appears to ignore your reasoning during an anxious moment, they are not being defiant. Their brain literally cannot access logical thinking in that state.

## Common Ineffective Parental Responses

1. **Dismissive reasoning:** Saying "that won't happen" or explaining why the fear is illogical
2. **Anxiety mirroring:** Becoming anxious alongside the child
3. **Quick-fix attempts:** Rushing to solve the problem before calming the nervous system
4. **Forcing perspective:** Pushing adult logic onto a child's emotional state

## The PAUSE Method Framework

### P: Pause

**Action:** Calmly tell your child you hear their concern. Take 5 to 10 deep breaths together before doing anything else.

**Why this works:**
- Parents have a natural instinct to immediately fix problems
- However, no calming attempts will work until the nervous system settles
- **Deep breathing is scientifically proven** to calm the nervous system
- Only after physiological calming can the child begin thinking clearly again

**Implementation note:** The pause comes before any problem-solving or reassurance.

### A: Acknowledge

**Action:** Validate the emotion your child is experiencing. Communicate that you see their worry.

**Critical principle:** Even if you cannot see any logical basis for the worry, **it feels completely real to the child**. Their subjective experience of fear is genuine regardless of objective circumstances.

**Anti-pattern:** Telling them to stop feeling a certain way. This invalidates their experience and does not reduce the anxiety.

### U: Understand

**Action:** Meet your child where they are in their worry. Ask exploratory questions.

**Recommended question:** "Can you help me understand what is bothering you right now?"

**Purpose:** This creates understanding of the specific nature of their worry, which enables more targeted help.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Ignoring the worry
- Dismissing the worry as silly or unfounded

### S: Safety and Soothe

**Action:** Two-part intervention:

1. **Remind** them they are in a safe place and can trust you
2. **Collaboratively create** a list of soothing strategies

**Example soothing strategies:**
- Deep breathing exercises
- Taking a break from the triggering activity
- Visualization of a happy place
- Any personalized technique that brings the child to calm

**Key principle:** The goal is returning the child to a physiological state of calm, not convincing them intellectually.

### E: Evaluate

**Action:** Join with your child to evaluate the worry. Help them distinguish thoughts from facts.

**Framework for evaluation:**
- **Thought:** The worry as the child expresses it
- **Truth:** The evidence-based reality

**Worked example:**
- **Thought:** "I'm worried my parents won't come home."
- **Truth:** "My parents always come home, even when I worry they won't."

**Key principle:** Remind children that **thoughts are not facts**. Help them identify what is actually true based on evidence.

## Core Philosophy of the PAUSE Method

The method centers on **joining children where they are** rather than imposing adult perspectives. Parents are not meant to dismiss, minimize, or overpower children's worries with logic.

**Parental role:** Create safe spaces for scary thoughts and difficult situations. Be a calm landing place for children experiencing distress.

## Important Caveats and Limitations

1. **PAUSE is one strategy among many.** Other approaches exist and may be appropriate.
2. **Seek professional help when concerned.** A counsellor can develop individualized strategies for specific children.
3. **Parental mental health matters.** If a child's anxiety causes parental stress, parents should also seek support.

**Foundational principle:** When parents are mentally well, they can best care for their children. Parental self-care is not selfish but essential to effective parenting.

## Summary of Conceptual Hierarchy

1. **Neurological reality:** Anxiety blocks logical processing
2. **Implication:** Logic-based interventions fail during anxious states
3. **Solution:** Physiological calming must precede cognitive engagement
4. **Method:** PAUSE provides a structured sequence that respects this reality
5. **Outcome:** Child returns to calm and can then evaluate worries rationally

## Key Terms Defined

- **Prefrontal cortex:** Brain region responsible for logical reasoning, temporarily offline during anxiety
- **Emotional brain:** Survival-oriented brain systems that dominate during threat perception
- **Nervous system regulation:** The process of returning the body to a calm physiological state through techniques like deep breathing
