## Core Insight: Unresolved Emotional Baggage Gets Passed to Children

The fundamental premise is that **if we don't resolve our old emotional issues, we take them out on our children**. When triggered by the past, we lose our conscious connection to what matters in the present moment. We say and do things we would never do if we weren't triggered.

Instead of supporting our children to work through their normal childhood issues and emotions, we add a layer of shame and blame. Instead of calming the storm and creating a safe haven, we end up escalating the drama. The consequence is that we pass our unresolved emotional baggage on to our children, who will carry it for the rest of their lives.

The opening quote captures this intergenerational dynamic: "Unpack your emotional baggage so your kids don't have to carry it!" - Lu Hanessian

## The Secret to Healing Triggers

The method is simple (though not easy):

1. **NOTICE the FEELING**
2. **RESIST TAKING ACTION**
3. **HOLD YOURSELF WITH LOVE**
4. **JUST ALLOW YOURSELF TO FEEL**

### Why This Works

All those actions we take when triggered take us down the wrong path. We leap to action or conclusion **to avoid feeling those emotions**. But once we allow ourselves to feel an emotion, it begins to evaporate.

By contrast, as long as we're pushing the emotion away or running from it, it keeps pestering us to be felt. We're doomed to lug it around with us until we get the message.

### Why Adults Can Handle This

When you allow yourself to feel any emotion you've been avoiding, it probably won't feel good. But you can handle that because you're not a child any longer. The emotions may feel dangerous, but they aren't. You're an adult, and you can love yourself through it. You can do hard things.

If it feels too scary and you want support, no shame, no blame. You can always find the support you need to help you do hard things.

## The Six-Step Blueprint for Healing a Trigger

### Step 1: Get Yourself Centered

**Create a sense of safety before beginning.** Imagine a place where you feel completely safe. Let that safety soak into your being. Remember three things you're grateful for, which will increase your sense of well-being and inner resourcefulness. Fill yourself with love and compassion. Surround yourself with light.

**Why this matters:** Your goal is to start from a place of safety, which keeps you from getting re-traumatized by those feelings.

### Step 2: Think of the Recent Event That Triggered You

You don't need to know what the old trigger was. Just think of the recent event that set you off. The recent event is the doorway to the old wound.

### Step 3: Resist the Urge to Rehash the Story

**Critical distinction:** Noticing the feeling does NOT mean getting tangled up in the story line and your judgments about what happened. Thinking about the story of what happened will just mire you in the muck.

We feel emotions in the body. So noticing the feeling means noticing the **sensation in your body**, not the narrative in your mind.

### Step 4: Notice How It Feels in Your Body

Recall the way your body felt during the recent event that set you off. Examples:
- Maybe your child screamed at you and your body cringed
- Maybe your child rebuffed your hug and you felt frozen inside
- Maybe your child cried and your body mobilized as if it were an emergency, with every nerve taut

**Just notice where you felt discomfort in your body. Breathe into those places.**

Notice that as your body feels these sensations, it doesn't feel safe. You may want to:
- Run (flight)
- Eat something (freeze)
- Call someone to tell them off (fight)

**Resist all of these urges.** When you want to jump up and check your phone, don't. When you feel an urgent need to clean the kitchen, don't.

Just keep breathing. Give yourself a hug and keep noticing the way that sensation feels in your body. As you allow yourself to feel it, the sensation will change.

### Step 5: Simply Observe

**The key insight:** If you can stay in your observer self, it keeps you from getting hijacked by the emotions. When we observe the sensation from the calm, safe perspective of our conscious adult self, it begins to evaporate.

The key is helping ourselves feel safe during the discomfort by consciously extending love and compassion to ourselves.

### Step 6: Give Yourself an Antidote

Create a positive counter-message. For instance, if you got triggered and screamed in your child's face, and now you're remorseful and terrified that you've damaged her for life, maybe your antidote is: "She's okay. I can repair this with her. I'm a good parent."

Imagine your child, happily smiling at you. Your imagination is powerful - you're programming your subconscious for repair.

## How Healing Accumulates Over Time

**Every time you do this process, you diminish the emotional charge of that trigger.** The next time this same old trigger is activated by some new event, you'll notice that it has less power. Eventually, you'll be able to stay calm in the face of an event that would once have triggered you.

### The Brain Science

Scientists don't yet know for sure, but it seems that by deactivating the emotional charge, you allow your brain to finally process the old memory.

**Example of transformed memory:** If your old trigger was being yelled at by your parent, you may still remember your parent screaming at you, but your takeaway will be that your parent was having a hard time, not that you were unlovable. You'll feel understanding for your parent, and compassion for yourself as a child, instead of shame. Your takeaway will be an ability to stay more calm when your child is upset.

### The Metaphor of Light and Shadow

Think of this as shining the light of consciousness on the memories that we've pushed into the dark basements of our psyches. Simply shining our own loving awareness into the shadows melts them away. One by one, we process the memories, remove the charge from the triggers, and they resolve. They no longer pop up to derail us as we go through life.

When we unpack our old baggage like this, we feel so much lighter, happier, less anxious, able to stay calm. And our children don't have to carry it.

## Understanding the Origins of Triggers

### Are All Triggers From Childhood?

No. Traumas can happen throughout life. But childhood traumas are usually the ones with the most power because that's the time when we're most easily overwhelmed by our emotions.

### The Pattern of Re-enactment

Many of the traumas we experience in later life are re-enactments of our earlier traumas, that we seem to create in the subconscious hope that they'll give us a chance to heal.

## The Long-Term Perspective

### This Is Lifetime Work

It will take your entire life to heal your triggers. This is the work of a lifetime.

### Why This Should Not Discourage You

**Every step you take makes you feel better.** Every time you feel those big emotions but resist acting on them by lashing out, you do some healing of that trigger and reduce its power. Over time, those triggers get deactivated.

### The Ripple Effects

Healing your triggers makes it easier to choose love with your child. And every time you choose love with your child:
- You touch your child's heart in a deep way
- You strengthen your relationship
- Your child gets easier to parent
- You send positive ripples into the world that will play out for generations

## Key Themes and Takeaways

**The body-emotion connection:** Emotions are felt in the body, not the mind. Healing happens through body awareness, not through analyzing stories.

**Safety enables healing:** Starting from a place of felt safety prevents re-traumatization and allows the emotional charge to dissipate.

**Action avoidance is avoidance:** The urge to take action when triggered is actually an urge to avoid feeling. Resisting action allows feeling to happen.

**Self-compassion is the container:** Holding yourself with love creates the conditions for difficult feelings to be felt and released.

**Intergenerational transmission:** Unhealed triggers get passed to children. Healing them breaks the chain.

**Progress is incremental:** Each successful processing reduces the trigger's power. The work accumulates over time.

**Present events access past wounds:** You don't need to identify the original trauma. Working with current triggers heals the underlying wounds.
