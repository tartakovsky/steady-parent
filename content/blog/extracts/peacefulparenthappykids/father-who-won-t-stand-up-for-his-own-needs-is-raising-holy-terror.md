# Why Parents Must Stand Up for Their Own Needs

## The Core Problem: Permissive Parenting Creates Insecurity

When a parent consistently fails to assert their own needs and boundaries, it creates a paradoxical situation for the child. The scenario described involves a 7-year-old boy who kicks, pushes, and physically dominates his father in public when frustrated, refusing to let his father move until his demands are met. The father's response is to stand still and allow the behavior, not wanting to embarrass his son.

This pattern reveals a fundamental misunderstanding: the child is not winning when he controls his parent. He is losing something essential - the feeling of safety that comes from knowing a capable adult is in charge.

## Why Children Push for Limits

**Children push against their parents to find boundaries that make them feel safe.** When a 7-year-old feels like he's in charge - that his father cannot even keep himself safe from his own child - this is frightening, not empowering. The child keeps escalating behavior precisely because he needs to find the limit that will contain him.

The pushing, kicking, and physical domination are not signs of a child who has won. They are distress signals from a child who desperately needs to feel that someone stronger and wiser is steering the ship.

## The Two-Way Nature of Respectful Relationships

A healthy parent-child relationship requires respect flowing in both directions:

1. **Children need to know their needs are taken seriously by their parents** - this is the piece most parents understand
2. **Children also need to know that parents' needs are taken seriously by the parents themselves** - this is the piece permissive parents miss

When parents let children walk all over them, they are not teaching the child that he is valued. They are teaching him a distorted model of relationships that will handicap him for life. A child accustomed to taking advantage of his parents will attempt the same with peers and will be disliked as a result.

## The Father's Shame as a Signal

The father in this scenario feels ashamed of what is happening. This shame is important diagnostic information - it indicates that what he is doing is not good for anyone, including the child he is trying not to embarrass. The instinct to avoid embarrassing the child is correct in principle, but the execution has gone wrong.

Not embarrassing a child does not mean allowing him to dominate and disrespect you. True respect for a child includes modeling self-respect and maintaining boundaries that keep everyone emotionally safe.

## The Parent's Personal History

The advice explicitly acknowledges that a parent who cannot stand up for himself likely has unresolved issues about having been respected as a child. However, having trauma does not justify passing dysfunctional patterns to the next generation. The parent must work out his own issues rather than visiting them on his son.

## Practical Considerations

**Avoid situations you cannot handle:** Until the pattern is resolved, a parent who cannot manage a tantruming child while also caring for a baby should not be alone with all children in public. This is not giving up - it is strategic retreat while working on the underlying issue.

**The behavior will stop when it stops working:** Tantrums continue because they produce results. Once a child learns that tantrums no longer get him what he wants - because the parent consistently holds a limit - the tantrums will stop. This resolution can happen "fairly quickly" if the parent is willing to start setting respectful limits on a consistent basis.

**Prevention is easier than intervention:** Ideally, a child's general cooperation is established well before age 7, making these situations rare. When that groundwork was not laid, it becomes harder to manage, but not impossible.

## What Not to Do

- **Do not stand by and watch your child be emotionally injured by permissive parenting** - the other parent has a responsibility to intervene
- **Do not let your own childhood wounds prevent you from giving your child what he needs** - get support and work on your issues
- **Do not confuse avoiding embarrassment with avoiding all limit-setting** - these are not the same thing
- **Do not assume physical size or strength is the real issue** - the core issue is relational, not physical

## The Emotional Injury of Permissive Parenting

The advice frames this situation explicitly as the child being "emotionally injured." This is a strong framing that challenges the common assumption that permissive parenting is at least harmless or kind. The injury comes from:

- Not feeling safe because no one is in charge
- Learning a distorted model of relationships
- Being set up for social rejection by peers
- Living with the scary feeling of having more power than you can handle

## Key Insight: Standing Up for Yourself IS Standing Up for Your Child

The resolution to this problem is not a technique for managing tantrums. It is a fundamental shift in the father's relationship with himself. When he begins to take his own needs seriously and sets respectful limits consistently, he gives his son the gift of security. The two things that seem opposed - the father's needs and the child's wellbeing - are actually aligned.
