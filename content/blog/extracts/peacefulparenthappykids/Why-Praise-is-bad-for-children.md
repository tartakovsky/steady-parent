## The Core Paradox: Praise as a Form of Reward

The fundamental insight from this research is that **praise functions with similar potency to tangible rewards**. When children receive rewards for something, they lose intrinsic motivation because the extrinsic reward overshadows the internal satisfaction and pride. Verbal praise creates the same effect as giving a child money, stickers, or ice cream.

As Alfie Kohn puts it: "An impressive body of scientific research has shown that the more we reward people for doing something, the more they tend to lose interest in whatever they had to do to get the reward. Now the point isn't to draw, to read, to think, to create - the point is to get the goody, whether it's an ice cream, a sticker, or a 'Good job!'"

This does NOT mean withholding love or encouragement. Children need love and encouragement like they need vitamins. They need to know you notice and appreciate when they try something new, work hard at something, or express values you admire like courage or compassion. The research simply helps us see how to tweak our approach to make positive encouragement a superpower for children.

## How Praise Undermines Intrinsic Motivation

When children are praised for specific behaviors, they draw conclusions about the inherent value of those behaviors. The logic works like this: if someone is rewarding me for doing this, it must not be worth doing on its own.

**Example: Reading**
Children who are praised for reading conclude that reading isn't inherently rewarding. The result is they become less likely to read independently because the activity has been framed as something you do to earn approval rather than for its own sake.

**Example: Eating Vegetables**
Children who are praised for eating vegetables conclude that vegetables aren't inherently delicious. The child's reasoning: you don't praise them when they eat chocolate, so clearly vegetables must be something unpleasant that requires external motivation to endure. The result is they're less likely to eat vegetables when no one is watching.

**Example: Sharing**
Children who are praised for sharing begin to share less when they think adults aren't watching. They have apparently learned from the praise that no one in their right mind would share out of the goodness of their heart. Sharing becomes a performance for adult approval rather than an expression of genuine generosity.

## Why Positive Judgments Sabotage Children

Most parents understand that negative judgments like "What?! Are you an idiot?!" undermine children. But positive judgments like "What a smart boy!" also sabotage children, even though this seems counterintuitive.

The mechanism works as follows:

1. Children who are often told they're smart begin to feel less confident, not more
2. They know their smarts are limited - there is so much they don't know
3. When they have to work hard at something, they assume that means they aren't smart
4. They don't feel they have any control over how smart they are
5. They don't know how to get any smarter
6. They don't want to disprove your opinion of them
7. So they avoid situations in which they may not appear so smart, such as learning new things they might have to work at
8. They often simply give up at a task they could master with a little effort

The solution is teaching children that intelligence isn't static but grows like a muscle when they apply it to learning. This helps children develop a **growth mindset** and encourages them to apply themselves so they see results.

## The Evaluation Problem: Constant External Assessment

Children who receive a lot of conventional praise conclude that someone is constantly evaluating their performance. This creates a cascade of negative effects:

- They become more insecure about expressing their own ideas and opinions
- They become less likely to raise their hand in class and venture a comment
- They learn that their value is constantly being evaluated from outside
- They become constantly worried about whether they're measuring up
- They become **praise junkies**, unable to take pleasure in their accomplishments unless another person tells them "Good Job"

## The Five Ways Conventional Praise Harms Children

1. **Makes it less likely that children will independently practice the behaviors they are praised for** - because the behavior becomes associated with external reward rather than intrinsic value

2. **Keeps children from applying themselves for fear they won't live up to the praise** - they become risk-averse because failure would contradict the positive judgment

3. **Undermines kids' self-confidence and willingness to take risks and participate** - constant evaluation creates anxiety about measuring up

4. **Turns them into praise junkies by teaching them to look for outside feedback to feel okay** - they lose the ability to self-evaluate and feel proud on their own

5. **Robs children of their joy in their accomplishments** - the focus shifts from internal satisfaction to external approval

## The Alternative: Seven Strategies for Effective Encouragement

The goal is to help children feel seen, accepted, and appreciated for who they are. This becomes an internal source of affirmation that outweighs any external evaluation and gives them an internal compass to express their values, from compassion to hard work.

The key distinction: you're not judging your child, you're loving them. As Deepak Chopra says: "Love is attention without judgment. In its natural state, attention only appreciates."

### 1. Empathize with Their Excitement

Instead of evaluating and telling them what you think about their accomplishment, share in their emotional experience.

**Example:** "Yes! You're pedaling all by yourself!"

Why this works: You're joining them in their moment of triumph rather than positioning yourself as a judge of their performance.

### 2. Let Them Know You're Really Seeing Them

Allow them to evaluate whether what they're doing is working rather than imposing your judgment.

**Example:** "I see that you're doing the sides of the puzzle first."

Why this works: You're demonstrating attention and interest without adding evaluation. The child remains the authority on their own process.

### 3. Point Out the Results of Their Behavior

Empower them to choose how to behave in the future by showing them cause and effect. This helps them develop their own moral compass.

**Example:** "Look how happy your friend is to have a turn with your toy."

Why this works: Instead of telling them sharing is "good," you're showing them the natural positive consequence. They can draw their own conclusion about whether this outcome is something they want to create again.

### 4. Encourage Effort

Focus on effort because that's what creates results. Effort is within the child's control, unlike innate ability.

**Example:** "You're working so hard on that.... I think just a little more practice and you'll nail it!"

Why this works: You're reinforcing the growth mindset - that persistence and practice lead to improvement - rather than suggesting success comes from fixed traits.

### 5. Be Specific in Your Description

Help your child feel their accomplishment is truly seen, rather than receiving a global "good job" that could apply to anything.

**Example:** "You counted from zero to twenty! Last week, you couldn't count that far. I see that you've been working on learning those numbers!"

Why this works: Specificity proves you were paying attention. It also connects their current achievement to their past effort, reinforcing the link between work and results.

### 6. Ask Questions to Help Them Reflect

Help your child begin to trust themselves to be the arbiter of their own performance.

**Example:** "Do you like the way it came out? Why or why not?"

Why this works: You're explicitly handing the evaluation role back to the child. They practice assessing their own work rather than looking to you for validation.

### 7. Express Your Own Feelings, Including Gratitude

Share your authentic emotional response rather than a judgment of their character or performance.

**Example:** "I love it when we work as a team like this! It makes the work so much faster! Thanks so much for helping me."

Why this works: You're sharing how their actions affected you rather than labeling them as "good" or "helpful." This models emotional authenticity while showing them the real-world impact of their choices.

## What to Avoid

- "Good job!" - This is a generic evaluation that doesn't demonstrate attention and trains children to seek external approval
- "Good sharing!" - This frames prosocial behavior as something done for praise rather than from genuine care
- "What a smart boy/girl!" - This creates a fixed mindset and fear of proving themselves less smart
- Any statement that positions you as the judge of their performance rather than a witness to their experience
- Any praise that implies the praised behavior isn't inherently valuable

## The Underlying Principle

Children need love and encouragement, but the form matters enormously. The goal is attention without judgment - being a loving witness to their experience rather than an external evaluator of their worth. When children feel seen, accepted, and appreciated for who they are, that becomes a superpower: an internal source of affirmation that gives them an internal compass to express their values without needing external validation.
