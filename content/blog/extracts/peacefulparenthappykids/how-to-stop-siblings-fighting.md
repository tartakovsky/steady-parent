# Intervening in Sibling Fights: A Complete Framework

Source: Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids (Dr. Laura Markham)

## The Core Problem with Common Approaches

### Why Taking Sides Backfires

When parents intervene in sibling conflicts by trying to establish who is right and who is wrong, it almost always causes more fighting rather than less. This happens for two interconnected reasons:

1. **It is nearly impossible to determine who "started" a conflict** - Sibling dynamics involve chains of provocations and retaliations that stretch back further than any single incident. What looks like the starting point is usually itself a response to something earlier.

2. **Taking sides increases resentment** - Even if a parent could accurately determine fault, the child who "loses" the judgment will feel that the parent loves the other child more. This resentment then fuels future conflicts, creating a cycle of escalating fights.

### Why "Let Them Work It Out" Often Fails

Many experts recommend letting children resolve their own battles, and this can work - but only under specific conditions. Children can successfully work things out themselves when:
- They have been explicitly taught how to do so
- They are not too overwhelmed by anger to use those skills

When these conditions are not met, the "let them work it out" approach leads to a predictable negative outcome: **the child with more power ends up bullying the other**. This violates a fundamental principle - every child has the right to feel safe in their own home.

The implication is clear: parents must actively teach conflict resolution skills before expecting children to apply them independently.

## The Parent's Role: Holding Environment

**Research finding**: One of the most important things parents can do to help children learn to manage their emotions is to stay calm themselves.

Children need to experience their parents as a **"holding environment"** - a safe harbor in the storm of their turbulent feelings. This concept is foundational because:
- When parents remain calm, children do not need to escalate their behavior to feel heard
- The parent's calm presence helps children settle down enough to listen to each other
- Experiencing a calm parent during emotional storms is the beginning of children learning to calm themselves

**Script example**: "I see two very upset kids here. I am right here now, to help you both. We can work this out."

This statement accomplishes three things: acknowledges both children's emotional states, establishes the parent's supportive presence, and expresses confidence that resolution is possible.

## The Nine-Step Intervention Framework

### Step 1: Stay Calm

This is the foundational step because everything else depends on it. The parent must take a deep breath and re-establish safety for BOTH children by listening to both of them. If you can do this, children will not have to escalate their behavior to feel heard.

The parent's calm is the precondition for children to settle down enough to listen to each other, which is itself the precondition for working things out.

**Key insight**: Managing big feelings is the first step in resolving conflicts - this applies to both the parent and the children.

### Step 2: Coach Problem-Solving (When Kids Aren't Too Upset)

If the children are not too emotionally overwhelmed, move directly into modeling basic problem-solving. The sequence matters:

1. **Model calm** - Your demeanor teaches as much as your words
2. **If the conflict is over an object, move it away** - This removes the immediate trigger and creates space for conversation
3. **Describe the problem without judgment** - Neutral framing helps children see the situation objectively
4. **Invite the children to come up with solutions; write them down** - Writing validates their contributions and makes the process concrete
5. **Go through the solutions one at a time** - Systematic evaluation teaches critical thinking
6. **Restate objections, compromises, and solutions as they're offered** - This ensures everyone feels heard and clarifies what is being proposed
7. **Get agreement on the solution** - Buy-in from both children makes implementation more likely

**Important branching point**: If the kids are too upset for problem-solving, skip to the emotional support steps below before attempting resolution.

### Step 3: Don't Take Sides or Worry About Who Started It

Instead of determining fault, connect with each child individually. The critical mistake most parents make is believing they must decide who is right and what the resolution should be.

The consequence of this mistake: whichever child "loses" becomes convinced the parent loves the other child more. This conviction increases resentment, which directly leads to more sibling fights in the future.

### Step 4: Help Each Child Feel Connected and Heard

**The method**: Tell each child that they have something important their sibling needs to hear. This reframes the situation from adversarial (you against your sibling) to communicative (you have something important to share).

**Full script example**:
"Lucas, I see you are upset and you have something important to tell Amelia. And Amelia, I see you are upset too, and have something important to tell Lucas. Lucas, hold my hand here so we can listen to your sister together, and then we will both listen to you. Amelia, you start. Take a deep breath and speak as calmly as you can, so we can understand your important words. Then tell Lucas and me why you're upset and what you need."

**Key elements in this script**:
- Acknowledges both children's emotional states
- Frames both children as having legitimate perspectives
- Physical connection (holding hands) creates grounding
- Structures the conversation so each child gets a full turn
- Encourages calm delivery ("speak as calmly as you can")
- Focuses on understanding ("so we can understand your important words")
- Asks for both feelings AND needs

**Then restate EACH child's perspective and wants** so they each feel understood - even if you think one of them is wrong. The goal is understanding, not agreement with their actions.

**Restating script example**:
"So Amelia, you hit your brother because he wrecked your game. And Lucas, you wrecked her game because she wouldn't let you play. Did I get that right?"

Notice this restatement:
- Does not express approval of hitting or wrecking
- Shows the causal chain each child experienced
- Checks for accuracy ("Did I get that right?")
- Treats both perspectives as worthy of articulation

### Step 5: Model and Uphold Standards of Civility Using Family Rules

When someone breaks a family rule, restate and reinforce it. This maintains structure while the emotional process continues.

**Example scripts for different rule violations**:

For interrupting:
"Right now we are listening to Jacob talk. Then it will be your turn to speak and Jacob and I will both listen to you."

For physical aggression:
"Our family rule is no touching someone's body without permission, and no hurting! I expect each of you to tell each other what you want and need without hurting each other."

For name-calling and disrespect:
"The rule in our family is that we treat each other with kindness and respect, and no name calling. I hear screaming and name calling. You can tell your sibling what you want without attack words like name-calling."

**The pattern**: State the rule, name the violation you're observing, reframe what is expected (expressing wants without the prohibited behavior).

### Step 6: If Someone Is Actually Hurt, Attend to Their Wounds with Empathy

**What to do**: Acknowledge the pain - "Ouch, that must hurt."

**What NOT to do**: Pass judgment on who was wrong. Resist the impulse to angrily attack the aggressor - just ignore her in the moment.

**Private processing is acceptable**: If you are in private (for example, putting on a band-aid in the bathroom), it is appropriate to let the wounded child blow off steam and empathize: "She really hurt your feelings, and your body. No wonder you're angry."

This allows emotional validation without public condemnation that would escalate resentment.

### Step 7: If Either Child Is Too Upset, Separate Them

**Preferred approach**: Listen to each child with the other one present. This allows both children to hear each other's perspective through the parent's facilitation.

**When separation is necessary**: If one child is too angry and is saying mean things about the other, separate them temporarily.

**Checking script**: "Can you two work this out now, or do you need time to cool off?"

**Warning about banishment**: Some parents send children to their rooms, but many kids have a hard time with that kind of banishment. If you do need one child behind a closed door, go with him to his room to "listen" to his upset.

**If children resist separation** and beg to be together, explain the physiological basis for the cool-off period:
"We all need 15 minutes to calm down. When you get mad, your body gets ready to fight or run, and we need to let our bodies calm down so we're ready to work things out. After this cool off period, once we have a peaceful home again, you two will be ready to work this out respectfully."

This script:
- Includes the parent in the calming ("We all need...")
- Provides physiological education about the fight-or-flight response
- Explains the purpose of the waiting period
- Frames the goal positively (peaceful home, respectful resolution)

### Step 8: If One or Both Kids Is Too Mad to Sit Calmly During Cool-Off

Suggest an alternative method - away from the sibling - of working out anger.

**Full script**: "I know you're mad, but we don't hit. Use your words. You can use this marker and paper and draw me a picture of how mad you are. You can go in the bathroom and shut the door and scream about how mad you are. You can throw pillows at the couch as hard as you want. But no hitting and no hurting."

**Alternative outlets offered**:
- Drawing the anger (symbolic expression)
- Screaming in a contained space (vocal release)
- Throwing pillows at furniture (physical release without harm)

**The boundary that remains firm**: No hitting and no hurting - these are non-negotiable regardless of emotional state.

### Step 9: Once Everyone Is Calm, Call the Kids Together

This is the resolution phase. The sequence:

1. **Help kids express their feelings and needs to each other** - "So you were really mad when Jaden wanted to play a different game."

2. **Empathize and restate each child's point of view** - Ensures both feel understood

3. **Teach empathy by asking each child how he thinks his sibling felt during the fight** - This builds perspective-taking capacity

4. **Back your children up as necessary** - "What did you hear your brother say?" This ensures active listening and comprehension

5. **Help kids repair, do over, or find win-win solutions** - The ultimate goal is restored relationship and learned skills

## The Long-Term Goal: Independent Conflict Resolution

Over time, children will be able to talk and work things out themselves. The milestone marker is when you can ask them to come to you with:
1. A description of what happened: "We wanted to play different games"
2. A plan for what they will do differently next time: "We will flip a coin" or "We'll play each game for half an hour"

This represents internalization of the conflict resolution process - children can now identify the problem, generate solutions, and select one without parental facilitation.

## Underlying Principles

### Children Want to Play Together

The fundamental assumption of this framework is that siblings genuinely want to connect and play together - they just lack the skills to work out conflicts. This reframes sibling fighting from a character problem to a skill deficit, which is addressable through teaching.

### Adults Often Lack These Skills Too

The article explicitly acknowledges that most adults did not learn conflict resolution skills as children. This serves two purposes:
1. It normalizes the difficulty parents face in teaching these skills
2. It suggests that learning and modeling these skills benefits the parents as well ("I know a lot of married couples who have the same problem")

### Safety as a Non-Negotiable

Every child has the right to feel safe in their own home. This principle is what necessitates parental intervention rather than simply letting children work things out - when the power differential is significant, non-intervention enables bullying.

## What NOT to Do: Common Mistakes

1. **Don't try to determine who started it** - The causal chain extends further back than you can trace, and the attempt itself causes more harm than it solves

2. **Don't take sides** - Even accurate judgments increase resentment and future fighting

3. **Don't angrily attack the aggressor** when attending to a hurt child - This public condemnation escalates rather than resolves

4. **Don't send children to their rooms alone** without considering that many children experience this as painful banishment - if separation is necessary, accompany the child

5. **Don't expect children to work things out independently before you have taught them how** - This just enables the more powerful child to dominate

6. **Don't skip the emotional regulation phase** and jump straight to problem-solving when children are too upset - the emotional work must come first

## Key Scripts Summary

**Initial intervention**: "I see two very upset kids here. I am right here now, to help you both. We can work this out."

**Structuring the conversation**: "Lucas, hold my hand here so we can listen to your sister together, and then we will both listen to you."

**Encouraging calm expression**: "Take a deep breath and speak as calmly as you can, so we can understand your important words."

**Restating perspectives**: "So Amelia, you hit your brother because he wrecked your game. And Lucas, you wrecked her game because she wouldn't let you play. Did I get that right?"

**Upholding rules**: "Our family rule is no touching someone's body without permission, and no hurting!"

**Checking readiness**: "Can you two work this out now, or do you need time to cool off?"

**Explaining cool-off**: "When you get mad, your body gets ready to fight or run, and we need to let our bodies calm down so we're ready to work things out."

**Redirecting intense anger**: "You can use this marker and paper and draw me a picture of how mad you are. You can go in the bathroom and shut the door and scream about how mad you are. You can throw pillows at the couch as hard as you want. But no hitting and no hurting."

**Building empathy during resolution**: "What did you hear your brother say?"
