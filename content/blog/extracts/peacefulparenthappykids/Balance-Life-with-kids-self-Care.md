# Parental Self-Care: Putting Yourself Back on the List

## Core Philosophy: Balance Is an Inside Job

The foundational principle is that **finding and maintaining balance cannot happen from the outside in**. External circumstances, other people's help, or perfect conditions will not create balance. Balance is an internal process that requires active self-attention and self-nurturing, even in the midst of caregiving demands.

The metaphor of "keeping your cup full" captures the core challenge: parenting constantly drains your emotional and physical resources, so the only sustainable approach is to refill yourself continuously while you tend to your child, not as a separate activity done later.

## The Pattern of Self-Denial

Parents often deny their own needs **automatically, without even noticing it**. This happens in small moments throughout the day:

- Wanting a cup of tea while helping with homework but dismissing it as "too much trouble"
- Needing a hug or a good cry but suppressing the impulse
- Wanting to pick up a crayon and color alongside your child but feeling "silly" about it
- Delaying bathroom visits until absolutely desperate

These small denials compound. The instruction is to start noticing this pattern and actively choose differently: **put what you need on the list and do it as soon as you can**.

## Strategy 1: Simultaneous Self-Tending

The approach is not to wait until you have "me time" separate from parenting, but to **check in with yourself while you're taking care of your child**. At each moment, there is some small thing that would nurture you physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually. The practice is to find it and give it to yourself.

The self-check question is: **Is there anything I can give myself right now that would help me stay in balance?**

This works because small, immediate self-care prevents the buildup of resentment and depletion that leads to burnout.

### When Something Big Is Missing

If there's something important you really need but aren't getting (the example given is sleep when you have an infant who wakes all night plus a toddler to tend during the day), the guidance is:

1. Acknowledge that dragging yourself through life feeling resentful isn't doing your toddler any good
2. Recognize you don't need to be a martyr
3. Make a plan, even just a step in the right direction toward getting the help you need
4. That first step creates momentum for the next step

The reasoning is that **one step in the right direction generates momentum**, which makes the next step easier.

## Strategy 2: Building the Habit of Presence

The instruction is to **tune into yourself as often as possible throughout your day**. Simply being present with yourself is described as an essential form of "attention" that we all need.

### The Connection to Child Behavior

When parents are distracted, children act out to get them to come back into the moment to connect with them. When parents are more present, children respond by wanting to "follow" them (meaning they become more cooperative). This creates a practical incentive for presence beyond just self-care.

### The Adrenaline Trap

Many parents, especially those who work outside the home, get **hooked on the adrenaline of rushing**. This is identified as a barrier to presence. The claim is that you'll be better at your job if you develop the habit of being more present, and if you're home with children, presence is essential.

### Two Reliable Doorways to Presence

1. **Breathing**: Take a deep breath and let it flood your body with well-being. Breathe in calm, breathe out stress.

2. **Noticing beauty through senses**: Shift out of thinking and into senses. Notice the light on the leaves, the smell of the rain, the curve of your child's cheek, the lilt of their laugh.

These are called "reliable doorways to presence" - meaning they consistently work to bring you back to the present moment.

## Strategy 3: The Transition Ritual

Before picking up your child at daycare or walking into the house after work, the instruction is to **stop** and perform this ritual:

1. Take a deep breath
2. Ask yourself: **"What do you need right now, My Love?"** (the tender self-address is intentional)
3. Listen to whatever answer pops up
4. Make a deal with yourself about when and how you will meet that need

### Examples of How This Works

- If the answer is "Comfort" -> work snuggle time with your child and/or spouse into your evening
- If the answer is "A break!" -> order pizza for dinner and put everyone to bed early so you can take a long bath

### Pattern Recognition

If you get the same answer every day, this is a signal that you may need to make **structural changes in your life**, not just tactical adjustments.

## Strategy 4: Slow Down and Show Up

The problem identified: parents often become so focused on "the list" (tasks, obligations, to-dos) that they forget to really live.

The reframe offered: **this is the only chance you get in this body, and your child really will be grown in the blink of an eye**.

### Your Child's Joy as Fuel

The specific insight is that if you're too busy to revel in your child's natural joy, **you're turning up your nose at the fuel that keeps you going as a parent**. Children's joy is positioned not as a nice bonus but as essential fuel for sustainable parenting.

### The Joyful Self as Antidote to Burnout

The question posed: **What happened to that joyful, exuberant person inside you?**

This internal joyful self is described as your antidote to burnout. The recognition is that your family and household will demand every moment you have, but many of those moments are full of joy if you choose to simply enjoy them and let the pressure go for a bit.

The key permission granted: **Your life doesn't have to be perfect for you to soak in every moment of goodness you can.**

## Strategy 5: Parent Yourself

The direct statement: **Whose job is it to nurture you? Yours.**

Spouses, partners, friends, and families are characterized as "companions on the journey," but there's a limiting factor: **we can only take in from them what we're able to give to ourselves**. This means external support has diminishing returns if internal self-nurturing is absent.

### For Those Who Weren't Nurtured as Children

If you weren't nurtured enough as a little one, learning to self-nurture may take some learning. The starting point offered:

**Start by talking to yourself like someone you love.**

Specific self-talk guidance:
- Nurture yourself through the hard times
- Acknowledge just how hard it all is and how hard you try
- Remind yourself: "You don't need to be perfect"
- Tell yourself: "You are more than enough, exactly as you are"
- Give yourself the message: "You deserve all the tenderness you would shower on a newborn baby"

### The Transformation Effect

Giving that love to ourselves is said to **transform our parenting and our lives**.

### The Practical Reality

Even when competing needs arise (like when the baby's crying and you yourself need a good cry), it's true that the baby comes first. But the nuanced instruction is: **tune into yourself and embrace yourself with love at the same time - and cry if you need to**. This will make both of you feel better.

This demonstrates that self-care and child care are not mutually exclusive even in high-demand moments.

## Self-Assessment Tool: The Internal Barometer

A simple 1-10 scale is offered for checking in:
- **1 = depleted**
- **10 = a full cup**

The practice questions:
1. How are you doing right now on this scale?
2. What one thing can you do right now to give yourself more support?

This creates a concrete, immediate action step rather than abstract intentions about self-care.

## Key Distinctions and Nuances

**Self-care is concurrent, not sequential**: The model is not "finish caregiving, then do self-care" but rather "tend to yourself while you tend to your child" or "as soon as possible."

**Small is sufficient**: The guidance consistently points to "some small thing" - not requiring grand gestures or major time blocks.

**Feeling silly is a barrier**: The example of wanting to color alongside your child but feeling silly highlights how self-judgment blocks legitimate self-nurturing.

**Martyrdom is counterproductive**: Explicitly named as something to avoid. The framing is that martyrdom doesn't serve children.

**Momentum matters**: Taking even one step in the right direction creates the momentum needed for subsequent steps.

**Structural vs. tactical**: If the same need appears repeatedly, the issue requires structural life changes, not just better daily management.
