## Core Framework: The Five-Step Approach to Childhood Aggression

When a child hits regularly, there are five interconnected actions parents must take. These are not sequential in the moment but rather form a complete system for addressing aggression at its root.

### Step 1: Prevent Hitting When Possible

Prevention requires **physical proximity**. Stay very close when your child is with other kids. This proximity allows you to intervene before hitting occurs. The strategy here is proactive supervision rather than reactive correction.

### Step 2: Set Clear, Firm, Kind Limits When Hitting Occurs

The limit-setting must be firm but never mean. The distinction matters because mean responses damage the safety your child needs to process their feelings later.

**Example script:** "No hitting. Hitting hurts. You can tell the other child what you want or need without hitting them. Here, I will help."

The phrase "here, I will help" is important because it keeps you positioned as a supportive ally rather than a punisher. This maintains the connection needed for the later emotional work.

### Step 3: Manage Your Own Feelings About the Hitting

Parents naturally feel anger when their child hits. However, parental anger does not make a child feel safer, and safety is what the child needs to process their underlying emotions.

**Two strategies for managing parental feelings:**

**Strategy A: Vent to others (carefully selected)**
Talk to other people about your feelings. Write in a journal. The purpose is to surface and process your own emotions. Behind anger lies fear. Common parental fears include:
- Something is wrong with my child
- I am a bad parent
- My child will become a criminal/psychopath

None of these fears are accurate, but they must be acknowledged and felt to dissipate. Once exposed to conscious awareness, they "shrivel up and blow away."

**Critical caveat about venting:** Do not talk to people who will reinforce your fears by giving alarming advice. Avoid those who react with their own fear and suggest drastic action. What you need is a compassionate listener, not someone amplifying your anxiety.

**Strategy B: Adopt the child's perspective**
Young children are small people who become easily overwhelmed. When they hit, they are afraid. They have become over-stimulated and disconnected from their parent, feeling alone and terrified. These feelings are unbearable, so they lash out. Understanding this causation creates sympathy. The instruction here is explicit: "Let him into your heart."

### Step 4: Help the Child with Their Feelings After They Hit

This step addresses the root cause. The child hits because they cannot bear their upset feelings. The goal is to help them tolerate and actually feel those feelings. When overwhelming emotions are fully felt in a safe context, they pass through rather than continuing to control behavior.

**This is not a verbal process.** It is not about teaching or talking. It is about creating safety. You speak only enough to maintain connection and help the child feel safe. Telling the child what they did wrong does not create safety. Teaching does not create safety.

### Step 5: Stay Connected Daily to Build Trust

Connection is built through warmth, touch, snuggling, and physical games. The key practice is **Special Time** - ten minutes of dedicated, uninterrupted attention every single day.

**How Special Time works:**
- Announce that you are fully available for ten minutes with no interruptions
- Alternate days between child-directed and parent-directed activities
- On child-directed days, the child chooses the activity and you play their way
- On parent-directed days, you choose activities that build connection and help process fear
- Prioritize physical games involving connection and power
- Anything that produces giggling is ideal

**Why Special Time matters:**
- Builds trust so the child can let feelings emerge rather than running away
- Makes the child more willing to rely on you for safety
- Enables the child to call for help instead of hitting
- Giggling releases the same feelings as crying, so more laughter means fewer tears needed later

### Step 6: Teach That Hitting Is Not Okay

Teaching happens at least two hours after the incident, when everyone is calm. The child already knows hitting is wrong - they simply cannot stop themselves in the moment. This is why the other five steps are more important: they enable the child to act according to what they already know.

**The teaching process:**

1. **Start with empathy:** "Remember at the park when you hit that little boy? You must have been so mad, to hit him."

2. **Keep a light touch and sense of humor.** Heavy lecturing creates fear.

3. **Listen and reflect:** "You were mad at him?...Tell me more..."

4. **Validate the feeling:** "So you were mad because he tried to grab your truck? No wonder you got mad!"

5. **Explore alternatives together:** "Next time, when you get mad, what could you do? Could you call me? Could you walk away? Could you hit the sand?"

6. **Practice through role-play:** "Let's practice. This stuffed animal tried to use your truck. You are so mad and want to hit him. But you remember there are other things you can do! So you call me. I am right over here talking to another mom. Call me right now."

The role-play creates **muscle memory** of alternative responses, making them more accessible in future emotional moments.

## Why Making the Child Feel Bad Backfires

Making a child feel like a bad person for hitting creates fear rather than learning. The child's internal experience becomes: "Mom says what I did was bad...but I couldn't help myself...I must be bad...what if she stops loving me because I am so bad?"

This fear causes defensive reactions such as:
- Blank staring
- Running away
- Emotional shutdown

The blank stare is not defiance - it is a fear response. The child puts up defenses when they feel "talked at" about what they did wrong. They are being scared rather than taught.

## Understanding Why Children Run Away After Hitting

When a parent approaches to set a limit, the child must face not only what they did (which they know was wrong) but also all their underlying upset feelings. The whole reason they hit was that their fear was unbearable. They do not want to feel that fear, so they run.

**What to do when the child runs:**
- Follow them and stay as close as possible
- If they say "go away," respond: "I won't leave you alone with these big scary feelings. I am right here."
- If they move further away, they are regulating distance. Respect this while remaining present: "I won't come any closer than this until you're ready, but I am right here."

The child is trying to manage the intensity of their emotional experience through physical distance. This is a form of self-regulation, not rejection. Let them control the distance while maintaining your presence.

## The Emotional Release Process: What Hysteria Actually Means

When a child becomes "hysterical" (out-of-control crying, possibly thrashing), this is positive progress. It means they feel safe enough to release their fear. These feelings have been pushing them to hit. They have been carrying this emotional weight for a long time. Once felt, these feelings will dissipate. After release, the child becomes more able to manage both feelings and behavior.

**How to support emotional release:**

- Stay close so they feel safe
- Do not try to talk while they are hysterical
- The purpose is releasing feelings; talking moves them from heart to mind, interrupting the process
- If possible, hold them
- If holding is not possible, maintain touch
- If touch is not possible, stay present and use your voice for connection
- Minimize words. Use brief, soothing phrases: "You are so upset...I am right here...You are safe..."
- Whatever you do, do not teach, correct, or explain what they did wrong
- They cannot listen during emotional release. Teaching will make things worse by breaking the sense of safety

**Duration guidance:** Ten minutes of crying is good. Twenty minutes is even better. The child has accumulated a "full backpack of fear." Continue supporting the release as long as you can stay kind and patient. Use a mental mantra: "He's getting out all that fear...he's healing...we're on the right track."

## The Transition Period After Emotional Release

After expressing big feelings, children become worried about whether they are still loved. One reason they held feelings in was believing those feelings were unacceptable. Post-release snuggling is critically important.

**What to say during reconnection:**
- "You were so upset. Thank you for showing me all those big feelings."
- "I am right here, no matter what."
- "I will always keep you safe."
- "I love you and I will always keep you safe."

**When moving back to normal life:**

1. First words should reflect feelings: "You were so upset...you were crying so hard."

2. Affirm safety and love repeatedly.

3. You can briefly acknowledge the hitting without belaboring it: "You hit that boy in the face. That hurt!" Then drop it.

4. Do not lecture. The brain is not fully engaged yet. Lecturing produces the blank stare, which is a defensive wall.

5. When the child seems done processing and ready to move on, offer practical transition: water to drink, washing face and hands together. These actions help put the incident behind you.

## Common Mistakes and What to Do Instead

### Mistake: "I just want to talk to you for a moment"

This approach is too tentative. The child continues playing because no clear limit has been set.

**Instead:** "I know you're upset but NO HITTING!" While saying this, get to the child's level, place your hand on their arm or back (gently but firmly for contact), and make eye contact. This clearly interrupts the hitting.

### Mistake: Talking while the child is upset

When children are upset, learning shuts down. You cannot teach someone whose emotional brain has overwhelmed their thinking brain.

**Instead:** Save all teaching for hours later. During the emotional moment, focus only on connection and safety.

### Mistake: Walking away out of frustration

When you walk away frustrated, the child feels your anger. This scares them. They are already worried about their big scary feelings inside, and they do need you close to feel safe.

**Instead:** If the child keeps running away, sit down so they do not move further away. Let them control the distance. Your job is to stay present without crowding.

### Mistake: Asking "What happened?" or trying to process verbally during upset

Verbal processing moves the child from heart to mind, interrupting emotional release.

**Instead:** Stay present, stay connected, minimize words to basic reassurance.

### Mistake: Restraining the child physically

Physical restraint typically increases upset rather than calming it.

**Instead:** Stay as near as they allow. Let them regulate distance. They will not run too far away - as evidenced by the fact that when you walk away, they come back. This is trust-building in action.

### Mistake: Persisting in "talking" for 10+ minutes while the child stares blankly

The blank stare means you are lecturing, not connecting. It is a defensive wall.

**Instead:** When you recognize the blank stare, stop talking. Check if crying is complete by empathizing briefly. Then follow transition steps to move on.

## The Three-Step Model for In-the-Moment Response

**Step One:** Interrupt the hitting by setting a clear limit and removing the child from the situation. This protects other children.

**Step Two:** Help the child with the feelings that caused them to hit. Aggression in mammals always comes from fear. You are helping with their fear.

**Step Three:** Teach that hitting is not okay. This happens hours later. Forget about it during the acute incident.

These steps have a sequence. You cannot skip to Step Three. You cannot effectively execute Step Three while still in Step One or Two. Teaching requires a regulated brain, which requires completing the emotional release of Step Two first.

## Understanding Aggression Through the Lens of Fear

**Central principle:** Aggression in mammals always comes from fear.

The child who hits is:
- Easily overwhelmed
- Afraid
- Over-stimulated
- Disconnected from the parent
- Feeling alone and terrified
- Unable to bear those feelings
- Lashing out as the only available response

When you understand this causation, you can respond with sympathy rather than anger. The hitting is a symptom of underlying fear, not a character flaw requiring punishment.

## The Parallel Parental Work

Parents must also work on their own comfort with big feelings. If parents were comfortable with big emotions, their children would probably be more comfortable too. This is not criticism but invitation: keep exploring your own feelings and allow yourself to feel even what is scary or uncomfortable.

**However, do not dwell excessively.** After processing your own feelings, visualize yourself in a positive state: holding your child, being understanding, generous of spirit, loving. The more you visualize and practice this positive state, the more you will feel it naturally.

Unconditional love is just as essential to the child's learning as the limits set on hitting. Teaching is actually the less essential element.

## Key Distinctions

**Firm vs. Mean:** Firm is clear, boundaried, present. Mean is punishing, shaming, angry. Firm preserves connection; mean destroys it.

**Teaching vs. Helping with Feelings:** Teaching is verbal, instructional, cognitive. Helping with feelings is physical, present, emotional. Both are necessary but at different times. Helping with feelings comes first and creates the foundation for teaching to be received later.

**Venting vs. Reinforcing Fear:** Venting is expressing your own emotions to process them. Reinforcing fear is having those emotions amplified by others' anxious reactions. Choose your confidants carefully.

**Blank Stare as Defiance vs. Blank Stare as Defense:** The blank stare is not the child challenging you. It is the child's protective response to feeling scared by lecturing. The solution is not to push harder but to stop lecturing and restore connection.

**Regulating Distance vs. Rejection:** When a child runs away or asks for space, they are managing emotional intensity, not rejecting the parent. The parent's job is to remain present while respecting the distance the child needs.

## Practical Implementation Details

**When intervening at the playground:**
- Approach immediately when hitting occurs
- Get to child's level
- Physical contact (hand on arm or back)
- Eye contact
- Clear verbal limit
- Remove from situation for privacy
- Support emotional release as long as possible before leaving the location
- Note: Driving home interrupts healing because the child does not feel connected in the car

**Daily prevention through Special Time:**
- Exactly ten minutes
- Every single day
- No interruptions
- Announced clearly to the child
- Alternating child-choice and parent-choice
- Focus on physical connection and giggling
- Results build over time through accumulated trust

**Teaching sessions (hours after incidents):**
- Light touch, not heavy lecture
- Start with empathy always
- Listen more than talk
- Validate feelings before offering alternatives
- Practice alternatives through role-play
- Keep it brief
