# Managing Strong Emotions: A Framework for Emotional Self-Regulation

## Core Principle: Feel, Don't Act

The central insight is a distinction between experiencing emotions and acting on them:

**"Allow yourself to feel all your emotions, but resist acting on them while you're upset."**

This is called **self-regulation**, and it is foundational to emotional intelligence.

### Why This Distinction Matters

- The feelings themselves are not dangerous. What's dangerous is taking action based on those feelings.
- When we're angry, we feel justified in lashing out. We think we're addressing the problem.
- But actions taken when angry are designed only to alleviate our upsetting feelings, not solve the actual problem.
- Despite the urgent need to take action, action taken when upset makes everything worse.

### Why Repression Is Not the Answer

- Stuffing feelings down rather than acknowledging them means carrying them around like a boiling pot.
- This makes us sick and tired.
- Repressed feelings often burst out unbidden, leading to loss of control (the "Mommy or Daddy Tantrum").

### The Middle Path

Allowing emotions while resisting action lets us:
1. Get the message the emotions are sending us
2. CHOOSE whether and how to act on those turbulent feelings

This is a learnable skill that gets easier with practice. Every time you choose to pause, feel, and NOT act, you're rewiring your brain, making it easier the next time.

## The Nature of Emotions

### Emotions Are Interpretations, Not Facts

- Emotions are a reaction to how we're perceiving our experience - whether we feel disrespected by our child, betrayed by our partner, or taken for granted by our boss.
- The other person doesn't "cause" the feelings. Every emotion we feel is triggered by our own interpretations.
- However, emotions are a real event in our bodies, complete with fight or flight hormones.

### Emotions Are Transient

- The fact that you're feeling something doesn't mean you'll be feeling it tomorrow.
- Don't get attached to emotions.
- **Identity distinction**: You aren't "mad" or "sad" - you're *feeling* "mad" or "sad." You are so much greater than your emotions, no matter how powerful they feel at the moment.
- You really can just notice them, accept them, let them move through you, and let them go.

### Anger Is Often a Defense

When humans are sad, hurt, or disappointed, we often find it hard to tolerate those feelings. So we get angry. This manifests as:
- Smacking your kid
- Blaming your partner
- Saying something mean about a colleague

**Anger is a defense** - the body's response to "fight or flight." When you get in touch with the fear or sadness underneath the anger, you no longer need the defense. The anger melts away.

## Ten Practical Guidelines

### 1. Allow All Feelings (Yours and Your Child's)

- Notice them
- Accept them
- Acknowledge them as just part of being human

### 2. Limit Behavior

Allowing feelings does not mean allowing all actions:
- Just because your child is allowed to be jealous of the baby doesn't mean he can hit her.
- Just because you're allowed to be fed up with your two-year-old doesn't mean you scream at her.

**Key insight**: You will always feel righteous when you're angry (and so does your child), but that doesn't mean you're "right" or should take action out of that anger.

### 3. Notice That Feelings Come and Go

See above section on transience. The temporal nature of emotions means urgent action is rarely warranted.

### 4. Don't Take Feelings Personally

- Just because your child is expressing anger at you doesn't mean her anger has anything to do with you.
- Just because you're mad at your partner doesn't mean your partner is wrong.
- **Nobody has to be wrong.**

### 5. Notice How You Defend Against Vulnerable Emotions

Recognize the pattern: vulnerable emotion (sadness, hurt, disappointment) -> intolerable feeling -> anger as defense -> harmful action.

### 6. Resist the Urge to Act on Your Feelings

**Warning sign**: When you URGENTLY need to take action, that means you're in fight or flight.

Response protocol:
1. Stop
2. Breathe
3. Resist acting

**Why yelling at your child never works**: Your child gets defensive and less cooperative. When your child feels worse, he acts worse.

**Test for major decisions**: If leaving your partner or quitting your job is a good solution, it will still look good tomorrow when you're calm.

### 7. Notice That Conclusions Drawn in the Heat of the Moment Are Not Necessarily True

Examples of heat-of-the-moment conclusions (not necessarily true):
- "My partner doesn't love me."
- "My boss will never reward my hard work."
- "My child will be a criminal."

**Why this happens**: That's not the thinking part of the brain talking. When you're upset, you actually lose access to reason and thoughtfulness. The emotional part of the brain takes over, and it tends toward rash conclusions.

### 8. Sit With Your Emotions

Process:
1. Breathe
2. Tolerate them
3. Let them sweep through you
4. They begin to evaporate

**Long-term benefit**: This is how you heal old wounds and dissolve old baggage, so you don't get overrun by emotion so easily in the future.

### 9. Use Feelings as Information, Not Action Triggers

Emotions can motivate you to solve recurring problems - but only once you're calm again.

**Contrast in problem-solving approaches**:
- When upset: The solution always seems to be forcing your child to do what you want.
- When calm: You can see that a more effective solution is to meet your child's deeper needs, help them with big emotions, and create an environment that allows them to flourish.

**Examples of calm-state solutions**:
- Your child needs more one-on-one time with you
- You need to start earlier on the bedtime routine

### 10. Never Work Through Difficult Issues When Hijacked

When you've been hijacked by the "fight, flight, or freeze" response, it's never a good time to work through a difficult issue.

**Protocol when things heat up**:
1. First: Restore a feeling of safety to help everyone calm down
2. Then: Explore win/win solutions that meet everyone's needs
3. Finally: Make structural changes to avoid a repeat scenario

## The Modeling Effect

You're the role model for your child on how to regulate emotions and develop emotional intelligence. Your example is what teaches your child that:
- Emotions are just part of being human
- Emotions can be managed

**Guiding principle**: Listen to your emotions, but don't give them more power than they deserve. They're only feelings, after all.

## Closing Reflection

> "Today I will let myself feel what I am feeling and let my children feel what they are feeling... I'll pay attention to what each of us is feeling and give those feelings some respect and space. There's nothing so bad about them; they are only feelings and need not threaten me." - Tian Dayton
