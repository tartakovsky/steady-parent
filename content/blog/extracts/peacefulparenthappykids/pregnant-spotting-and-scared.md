## Core Guidance

### Immediate Medical Consultation is Recommended

When experiencing spotting during early pregnancy, the recommendation is to **call and see a doctor right away**. This applies even though spotting may turn out to be completely normal and harmless.

### The Reasoning Behind Immediate Action

The urgency is not primarily about medical emergency, but about **maternal peace of mind**. The logic:

1. Spotting may be completely fine medically
2. However, uncertainty and fear are harmful to both mother and baby
3. Being in a state of panic about spotting creates stress that negatively affects pregnancy
4. Therefore, getting medical confirmation (even if everything is normal) serves a protective function

### The Dual Benefit of Seeking Care

Seeing a doctor accomplishes two things simultaneously:
- Rules out or identifies any actual medical concerns
- Eliminates the psychological burden of uncertainty and fear

## Managing Anxiety While Waiting

**"Keep breathing"** - This brief instruction acknowledges that anxiety is a natural response to spotting during pregnancy, and that active calming (through breath) is both appropriate and necessary during the waiting period before seeing a doctor.

## Context and Limitations

This guidance was provided to a first-time pregnant person at approximately 2 months gestation. The response prioritizes emotional wellbeing alongside physical health, recognizing that maternal stress itself is a health concern during pregnancy.
