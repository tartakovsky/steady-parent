# Do Sticker Charts Work for Crimes of Passion?

## Main Topic
Why sticker charts and reward systems are ineffective for managing emotionally-driven misbehavior in young children

## Key Concepts

### Problems with Reward-Based Motivation
- Sticker charts make children focus on the external reward rather than experiencing intrinsic value in the behavior
- Once the reward is removed, the desired behavior stops because it no longer feels rewarding
- Praising sharing ("Good sharing!") causes children to only share when being watched
- Paying children to eat certain foods makes them hate those foods permanently

### The Two Secrets of Impulse Management

**Secret #1: Competing Impulse Principle**
- Managing impulses requires a competing impulse that the person wants even more than the undesired behavior
- Example: Wanting to fit into a new dress competes with wanting to eat ice cream

**Secret #2: Emotional Capacity Requirement**
- Managing behavior through competing impulses only works if the person has enough self-control to manage the emotions driving the behavior
- If the emotions are too overwhelming ("emotional eating" or "crimes of passion"), competing impulses will not work
- Young children (under 3) lack sufficient prefrontal cortex development to connect current behavior with future rewards

### Why Sticker Charts Fail for "Crimes of Passion"
- Emotionally-driven misbehavior (like sibling jealousy) involves overwhelming feelings that cannot be overcome by delayed rewards
- The emotions must go somewhere - suppressing them for a sticker is not developmentally possible for young children
- Intense feelings like jealousy, fear, and anger need to be addressed directly rather than incentivized away

## Practical Takeaways

### Alternative to Praise for Sharing
- Instead of saying "Good sharing"
- Say: "Look how happy your friend was to use your truck"
- This helps children notice the intrinsic reward (positive feelings from making others happy)

### Alternative Approach to Picky Eating
- Instead of rewarding eating disliked foods
- Keep serving the food and require only one taste: "You don't have to like it, and you don't even have to eat it. You just have to taste it."
- Over time, children develop acceptance through exposure

### Understanding Emotionally-Driven Misbehavior
- Recognize that extreme behaviors often stem from deep fears (not being loved enough, not being good enough)
- Simply giving more attention may not address the underlying terror
- The solution requires helping children process and manage their intense emotions, not just incentivizing different behavior

## Age Group
Toddlers and preschoolers (specifically addresses children under 3)
