## The Developmental Stages of Play

Children progress through distinct play stages as they develop, and understanding this sequence is essential for correctly interpreting a toddler's social behavior.

**Onlooker or Observant Play** occurs in babies who are not yet able to manage their bodies. They watch others but cannot physically participate.

**Solitary Play** begins around one year old. Children play independently, focused on their own activities rather than interacting with others.

**Parallel Play** emerges between ages two and three. This stage is defined as children playing next to, but not with, other children. The key insight here is that while they may not seem to be interacting, they are actually very aware of each other's presence. During parallel play, children:
- Watch each other covertly
- Copy each other's noises or actions
- Sometimes grab a toy that the other child puts down

This developmental sequence means that a 21-month-old engaging in solitary play is completely normal. This pattern can easily continue for another full year before transitioning to parallel play.

## Parallel Play as an Assessment Strategy

Parallel play serves a specific developmental function beyond being a transitional stage. Children use parallel play when introduced to a new group of children because it allows them to assess the other kids and learn the best way to "enter" the group. This means that even children who have developed social skills may revert to parallel play strategically when facing unfamiliar social situations.

Children who find a group overwhelming may play nearby without actually engaging for quite a long time. This is a protective mechanism, not a developmental delay.

## Recognizing the Sensitive, Easily Over-Stimulated Child

Certain behavioral patterns indicate that a child may be sensitive and perceptive, making them easily over-stimulated by the tumult of groups of children.

**Key indicators:**
- Prefers to play by himself in a different part of the room from everyone else
- Runs around rather than engaging when in group settings, even when he anticipates seeing familiar people with pleasure
- Says familiar people's names with happiness but does not reciprocate curiosity from other children
- Connects well with individual adults who take the trouble to engage one-on-one
- "Comes alive" when someone makes the effort to engage him personally

**Why this matters:** Being easily over-stimulated is very common, not a problem. However, it has practical implications:
- It can cause children to distance themselves from groups, particularly when a parent is not present as a security blanket
- It can cause them to run in circles and act out
- It sometimes makes kids hit other children because they are too wound up
- It can make being in groups of kids without a parent present stressful for them

## What Toddlers Actually Need Developmentally

**Contrary to popular belief, kids do not need the experience of being in a group of peers while they are toddlers.** Developmentally speaking, what is most important for toddlers is engaging with the adults who are important to them, not peers.

**Positive signs of healthy development:**
- "Flirting" with adults the child wants to connect with indicates healthy social motivation
- "Coming alive" when adults take the trouble to engage indicates the child likes and trusts adults and is open to relationships
- Interacting well with adults one-on-one demonstrates the social capacity exists

These behaviors suggest the foundation for future peer relationships is being built through adult relationships.

## Practical Recommendations

### For Sensitive Children in Group Settings

**Experiment with one-on-one playdates instead of group settings.** A child who seems uninterested in peers in groups may become much more interactive when there is just one other child present. The stimulation level is manageable, allowing the child's social skills to emerge.

### For Childcare Settings

**The goal is to establish one "special person" for the child in the childcare environment.** This provides:
- Someone the child can attach to and depend on
- A more secure experience overall
- A pathway to becoming more comfortable with other children in that setting over time

**How to implement this:**
- Pick out this person together with your child if possible
- Actively foster that attachment through your behavior and conversation

**Important caveat:** The childcare workers will most likely need to keep the child near them so they can also tend to other kids. This proximity to activity and other children may be too much for a sensitive child. Therefore, do not expect the child to relate to their "special" daycare worker all the time. The realistic goal is that knowing that person is in the room will help the child feel more secure, even when not directly interacting with them.

### Ongoing Support

Simply providing opportunities to be around other kids (such as getting together with other moms) is sufficient. The child will gradually begin to interact with peers as development progresses. No special intervention is required for normal developmental variation in social interest.

## What Is Not a Warning Sign

A 21-month-old who:
- Plays solitary rather than engaging with peers
- Shows less curiosity about other children than they show toward him
- Stays in a separate area during group childcare
- Runs around rather than engaging when with other families

These behaviors are not warning signs about development. They represent normal variation and potentially indicate a sensitive temperament that requires accommodation rather than concern.
