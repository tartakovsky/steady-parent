# Helping Children Cope When a Parent Abandons the Family

## Core Understanding: Parental Abandonment as a Form of Death

When a parent cuts off contact with their children, this constitutes a profound loss that is in some ways worse than death. The abandonment carries unique pain because:
- The parent has actively chosen to leave, making promises and then breaking them
- The parent has deliberately blocked contact (phone calls, etc.)
- Children cannot interpret this except as personal rejection
- Unlike death, there is no finality - the wound stays open with possibility of false hope

**Critical insight**: Children always assume that if they were better, more perfect, the parent would have stayed. Even when parents say "this has nothing to do with you," children internalize the rejection as information about their own worth.

## Why Parents Abandon Children After Divorce

Many fathers cut off relations with their children after divorce. The underlying dynamic:
- Anger at the mother becomes overwhelming
- Guilt and grief over their own inability to make the marriage work is too much
- The children trigger that pain at every visit
- If they cannot work through the pain in a healthy way, they simply bolt

For parents with Asperger's specifically, additional factors compound the problem:
- Difficulty seeing things from the child's perspective (which can appear as narcissism)
- Feeling overwhelmed by relationships and needing to "run away"
- Inability to process feelings in a healthy way
- These traits may be complicated by pre-existing emotional issues that divorce intensifies

**Important nuance**: Not all Aspie parents abandon their children. Some manage relationships well. The combination of AS traits plus unresolved emotional issues plus divorce trauma creates this particular pattern.

## The Parent's Responsibility: Countering the Rejection Narrative

It is the remaining parent's **responsibility** - not just an option - to communicate clearly and repeatedly that the absent parent's abandonment is information about HIM, not about the children.

**Key distinction**: This is not the same as criticizing or bad-mouthing the absent parent. The goal is:
- Not to excuse the behavior
- Not to blame the absent parent
- To state the truth that he is not "able" to act like a father (which is factually accurate since he isn't doing it)
- To help children understand that any father would feel lucky to have them

## The 10-Step Conversation Framework

### Step 1: Opening with Love Affirmation
Begin by saying you want to tell your child something important, then affirm: "You know how much I love you and how wonderful I think you are, right?" Give a hug. This creates safety before addressing the painful topic.

### Step 2: The Core Message Delivery
Say: "Your father would think you are wonderful too, if he could know you. He's had a very hard time in his life, and it has kept him from being much of a father to you. He just isn't capable of being a father, and so he's had to cut himself off from us. I hope someday that will change, but it hurts, I know. But I want you to know that his not being able to be a father to you is about HIM, not about YOU. Any father would feel lucky to have you as a daughter/son."

**Why this exact framing matters**:
- "Would think you are wonderful too, if he could know you" - separates the child's worth from the father's inability to perceive it
- "He just isn't capable" - states fact without blame
- "About HIM, not about YOU" - the critical reframe that must be explicit

### Step 3: Stop Talking and Let the Child Respond
Give space for the child's reaction. Likely responses:
- Crying (processing grief)
- Anger (defense against hurt they don't want to feel)
- Attacking you for bringing up the topic (displaced anger)

### Step 4: Manage Your Own Emotions
Breathe through your own feelings. If attacked:
- Stay connected to your love for the child
- Stay connected to the hurt underneath their anger
- Acknowledge their right to be angry

Sample responses:
- "You're mad at me for bringing this up. We don't have to talk more right now. But it's a big deal, and when things are a big deal they need to be talked about sometimes, even when it hurts."
- "You are so angry at him. I feel very angry myself sometimes, that he doesn't act like a father to you. You deserve a father. It doesn't seem fair."

### Step 5: Hold Space for Grief
If the child cries, hold them and acknowledge: "So much sadness... it is really hard..." No fixing needed, just presence.

### Step 6: The Neither-Blame-Nor-Excuse Balance
Notice that the conversation has neither blamed Dad nor excused him. The framing "not able" is deliberately neutral while being truthful.

### Step 7: Explore the Child's Understanding
Ask: "WHY? Why do you think your dad is not able to act like a dad?" Listen to whatever they say:
- Angry statements about him
- Blaming you
- Blaming themselves
Let them vent without correcting.

### Step 8: Share Your Perspective Compassionately
After they've expressed themselves, offer your understanding. Practice this beforehand to avoid venting your own rage.

Example: "You know your father has Asperger's. That makes it harder for him to have relationships. He feels overwhelmed and he just has to run away. It doesn't make sense to us, but to him it seems like the only way to handle all of his upsetting feelings."

**Special consideration for families where another child has the same condition**: Explicitly add that not all people with AS struggle with relationships this way. Some manage well. For whatever reason, not their dad. This prevents siblings from fearing they will become the same.

### Step 9: Repeat the Core Message
Return to the message from Step 2 - that their dad would adore them if he could get to know them. Repetition reinforces the critical reframe: dad's behavior is information about him, not them.

### Step 10: Closing with Ongoing Permission
End with: "I just want you to know that I am here to talk about this anytime. Anyone would be upset to have their father go off and leave and not act like a dad to them. You have a right to be upset, and you do not have to keep it all bottled up inside."

Give a hug, then transition to a lighter activity to change the mood.

## Why Individual Conversations with Each Child

Each child needs a one-on-one conversation rather than a family discussion because:
- Assessing where each child is in their processing
- Allowing each child to express feelings without worrying what siblings think
- Different children are at different stages (the oldest daughter struggling most in this case)
- Each can respond authentically without performing for others

## The Long Game: Ongoing Grief Support

The initial conversation is just the beginning. Children will need to grieve for a long time. Grief will resurface at:
- Christmas
- Birthdays
- Graduations
- Ball games
- Any significant event where fathers typically attend

**Warning**: Expect acting out. Respond to the underlying need (to be convinced of your love, to vent feelings) rather than simply disciplining the behavior.

**Gender-specific concerns**:
- Girls may go "looking for love in all the wrong places" when they lack a father's love
- Boys have difficulty growing into men when their dad has given them the message that they aren't good enough

## The Ritual Framework for Processing Absent-Parent Grief

### Why Rituals Matter
Families who lose a parent to death have funerals. Abandonment is also a loss but has no formal acknowledgment. Creating a ritual fills this gap and provides:
- Demarcation between the silence before and acknowledgment now
- Structured opportunity to express feelings
- Collective family experience of the grief
- Transition toward future without excessive focus on the absent parent

### The Birthday Cake Ritual
On the absent parent's birthday, gather with candles on a cake (one for each child). The remaining parent starts: "You would not believe how amazing your children are. You are missing some wonderful kids. In fact, we're about to have some delicious cake, and you're going to miss that too! Your loss. We're sorry that you can't let yourself act like a dad and be part of our lives, but we know you're out there somewhere in the world, and we hope you have a happy birthday, even when we miss you and sometimes we're mad at you."

Then go around asking "Anything you want to add?" with these guidelines:
- Comments don't have to be nice
- Comments don't have to be reverent
- Kids can say whatever they want
- Parent nods in understanding
- Humor is encouraged because laughter vents the same pent-up emotions as tears

Everyone blows out candles together, eats cake, and each child shares what they're looking forward to in the near future. This creates forward momentum.

### The Letter-Writing Ritual
Children dictate letters to the absent parent while the remaining parent writes. Options:
1. **Mail the letter** - Pro: Gets feelings out in the open. Con: Creates expectation of response that won't come.
2. **Write and burn without mailing** - Acknowledge together that he cannot be reached, but feelings about that are valid and can be expressed. Having the parent write (rather than child writing directly) makes burning it feel less hopeless.
3. **Write individually, crumple, throw in fire** - After trying mail once with no response, shift to this ritual acknowledgment that he's unreachable.

**Why letters work**: They help children process feelings. Children need a chance to vent to a compassionate witness (which is you).

## Alternative Emotional Outlets

If children won't talk openly (which is common), remember that **giggling releases nearly as much emotional tension as crying**. Regular pillow fights provide physical release and shared laughter that helps process underlying emotions without requiring verbal expression.

## Regarding Contacting the Absent Parent

### The Risky Letter Option
Writing a heartfelt letter to the absent parent carries risks:
- He may show up once, make promises, then bolt again
- This might be worse than the current situation
- Though it would at least let kids clearly see what's happening

### The Ideal Scenario
If the absent parent could show up once to tell the children:
- He loves them
- He can't be part of their lives
- It's his fault, not theirs
- He will see them when they grow up

This would provide closure without false hope.

### How to Write the Letter (If Attempting)
- Don't make him feel blamed
- Show you understand he can't maintain ongoing contact
- Reference the painful public encounter (walking past at the mall) and ask that if it happens again, he speak to them once
- Be explicit that you're asking for a single conversation, not ongoing contact
- In-person is best but digital/letter would work

**Realistic expectation**: The letter will probably fall on deaf ears. But the attempt might be worth making.

## The Fundamental Truth About Resilience

Children don't need perfect lives. They need **one parent who**:
- Adores them
- Puts their welfare at the center of her life
- Accepts them completely
- Accepts all their messy, upsetting emotions

With this foundation, children can weather even major challenges like parental abandonment and come out okay.
