## Why Toddlers Throw Things

**Throwing is completely normal developmental behavior for 19-month-olds.** A baby's job at this age is to explore the world, and throwing things is one way they learn about gravity and cause-and-effect. This is not defiance or misbehavior - it is age-appropriate exploration.

**Two-year-olds (and those approaching two) throw things in multiple emotional states.** They throw when they're happy and they throw when they're upset. They also hit their parents and siblings during this phase. This is a normal developmental phase that children need to work through, not a character flaw requiring punishment.

## Why Physical Discipline is Harmful

**Physical discipline causes serious harm to babies and toddlers.** Even a "smack" is very harmful to a baby or child at this age. The damage is not just physical but psychological and relational.

**What hitting actually teaches children (the opposite of intended lessons):**

1. **People who love you will hurt you** - This teaches that love and pain go together, which sets up unhealthy relationship patterns
2. **Hurting others is permitted under certain circumstances** - Rather than learning that hitting is wrong, children learn that hitting is acceptable when you're the bigger/stronger person or when you're upset

**The parent in the question describes a damaging cycle:** After hitting, the child "minds it and becomes silent" and "keeps looking at my face until I give him a smile." This is not learning - this is a distressed child seeking reconnection and reassurance after being hurt by the person they depend on for safety.

## The Alternative Approach: Teaching Through Connection and Redirection

### The Core Principle

**Set limits while staying connected to your child.** The goal is to teach children the difference between what they may and may not do - this must be done repeatedly until they learn. Limits should be set gently, not through pain or fear.

### The Framework: Accept Feelings + Stop Behavior + Redirect

This framework has three simultaneous components:

1. **Accept the underlying feelings** - Recognize that children throw for reasons (exploration, happiness, frustration)
2. **Stop the unacceptable behavior** - Physically intervene to prevent harm
3. **Redirect to acceptable alternatives** - Give them something they CAN do

### Practical Examples with Teaching Points

**Example 1: Throwing blocks when angry**
> "Hold it! Blocks are not for throwing - even when you're angry. Here, you can throw the pillow or the balloon."

This demonstrates: Name the rule clearly, acknowledge the emotion behind the behavior, then immediately offer an acceptable alternative for the same impulse.

**Example 2: Hitting parent**
> "Ouch, that hurt! I can't let you hit me. But you can tell me what you feel. You can say, 'I don't want you to be with the baby now. I want you to be with me!'"

This demonstrates: Express your own boundary, but give the child words to express the underlying need. The child is helped to understand their own feelings and learn verbal communication as a substitute for physical expression.

**Example 3: Shoving sibling**
> "No shoving! Tell your sister what you want with words, not shoves. Tell her, 'My doll. I'm not ready to share.'"

This demonstrates: Stop the behavior immediately, then teach the social skill of using words. The parent provides the exact script the child could use.

**Example 4: Cutting carpet with scissors**
> "The carpet is not for cutting. Let's see, what can you cut? How about this paper? Or this cardboard? Which one? You decide."

This demonstrates: State the limit, then redirect the impulse to explore/cut toward acceptable materials. Offering a choice ("Which one? You decide") gives the child autonomy within safe boundaries.

## Key Concepts

### The Parent's Job vs. The Child's Job

**Child's job:** Explore the world (this includes throwing things to learn about gravity)

**Parent's job:** Guide and love the child. This means setting limits while staying connected, teaching through guidance rather than punishment, and understanding behavior through a developmental lens.

### The Importance of Repetition

Teaching toddlers the difference between acceptable and unacceptable behavior must be done "over and over again until they learn what they need to learn." This is not because the child is defiant or slow, but because learning impulse control and social rules takes time and repeated practice at this developmental stage.

### Acknowledging Intergenerational Patterns

The response acknowledges that parents may hit because they were hit themselves and haven't seen other ways to guide children. This framing is important because it:
- Removes shame and blame
- Validates that the parent clearly loves their child and wants what's best
- Opens the door to learning new approaches without defensiveness
