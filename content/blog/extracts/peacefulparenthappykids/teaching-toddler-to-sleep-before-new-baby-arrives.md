# Teaching Toddler to Sleep Before New Baby Arrives

## Core Context and Framing

The question comes from a grandmother whose son and daughter-in-law have a **21-month-old** who wakes at night needing a bottle or cuddling, and they are expecting another baby in a few months. The parents have started letting the toddler cry it out, hoping he will learn to self-soothe. Both parents work full time, and the toddler attends daycare.

Dr. Laura's response frames this as a common but complex challenge, made more difficult by the combination of two working parents, the toddler's young age, and the impending arrival of a new sibling. The key insight is that there are no quick fixes, and any solution will take time, which creates tension with the upcoming family change.

## Fundamental Principle: Humans Learn to Self-Soothe by Being Soothed

This is the central theoretical foundation underlying all the practical advice.

**How self-soothing develops neurologically:**
- When a baby or young child cries and is soothed by a caregiver, they experience soothing biochemicals
- This begins developing the neural pathways that will deliver those soothing neurotransmitters for the rest of their life
- The child's neurology organizes itself so they eventually learn to soothe themselves
- The idea that children learn to self-soothe by being left to "figure it out for themselves" is characterized as **wish-fulfillment**, not how brain development actually works

**What happens when crying is ignored:**
- Nature has designed survival instincts; a 21-month-old left alone is indeed in real danger
- When no one responds to crying, it triggers **survival panic**
- Repeatedly leaving a 21-month-old to cry will affect neural development
- Research suggests this makes the person more likely to panic in challenging emotional situations, especially those involving abandonment (romantic breakups, death, being fired, rejection)
- The tendency to get upset about little things becomes heightened
- The ability to self-soothe becomes compromised
- This can create a more "dramatic" and "difficult" personality

**The memory and storage problem:**
- With preverbal children, there is less continuity in feeling states and memories are stored differently
- A baby who has been left to cry may seem fine the next morning
- However, those experiences of terror are being stored and still affecting the child
- Children slightly older who experience feeling abandoned remember those experiences as traumatic throughout their lives
- Fear is at the root of much acting out, including angry and obstinate behavior

**The core warning:** While leaving children to cry alone at night may teach them to give up on calling for parents, the cost is too high. They give up calling, but the emotional damage accumulates.

## Why Full-Time Working Parents Often Face More Night Waking

This is presented as an observation rather than research-backed finding, but Dr. Laura expresses strong conviction based on what parents have reported:

- When both parents work full time, the toddler often needs **more parenting at night** to feel secure
- Kids with two full-time working parents tend to go to bed later and wake more often
- Many mothers who return to work after time at home report their child begins waking at night even when they had previously been good sleepers
- **Connection is a critical need** for toddlers, and night waking may be the child making sure they get enough of it
- This reframes night waking not as a behavioral problem to be fixed but as an adaptive response to insufficient connection during waking hours

## The Seven-Step Approach to Better Sleep

### Step 1: Understand Sleep Cycles and "Crutches"

**The mechanics of night waking:**
- All humans go through various stages of sleep during the night
- As we transition between stages, we awaken slightly
- The goal is helping the child find their way from light sleep back into deeper sleep without needing an outside crutch

**What constitutes a "crutch":**
- Anything outside the child's control that they need to make the sleep transition
- Examples: bottles, rocking, pacifiers, being held
- Children can get used to a specific crutch and need it every time they awaken slightly

**Specific recommendation for bottles:**
- Stop giving toddlers over about **15-18 months** milk at night
- Night bottles train the child to awaken
- Night bottles are bad for teeth
- This is presented as opinion, not absolute rule

### Step 2: Go Gradual When Removing Crutches

**The hunger mechanism:**
- A child used to having a bottle at night will be hungry for it at night, just like adults get hungry at lunch
- This is a physiological pattern, not just a habit

**The dilution method:**
- Gradually dilute the milk with water so the child gets less and less milk at night
- The child will probably begin eating more during the day to make up for lost calories (this is desirable)
- Within a few weeks, the child will probably stop waking for the bottle because they are no longer counting on it for calories

This method works because it addresses the biological need rather than just trying to eliminate the behavior.

### Step 3: Help the Toddler Process Feelings During the Day

**Why toddlers have big feelings at night:**
- The world is full of new and often scary things adults don't even notice
- Examples: barking dogs, other toddlers grabbing toys, separating from parents all day
- The toddler tries all day to "be a big boy" and hold those feelings in
- Evening time (dinner, bath, bedtime) goes fast
- At night, dreams bring up fears and worries
- When the child wakes slightly, those feelings swamp them
- They genuinely DO need comforting to cry those feelings out

**The alternative to night processing:**
- The child doesn't have to process feelings at night
- Any time a parent sets a reasonable limit is an opportunity for the child to tap into that backlog of feelings and let them out
- Parents who understand this and give their child a safe, supportive, empathic place to express feelings by crying or raging in their arms **during the day** are often rewarded by a child who sleeps better at night

This connects daytime emotional work directly to nighttime sleep quality.

### Step 4: Examine How the Child Falls Asleep

**The association problem:**
- Children rocked to sleep will want to be rocked when they wake at night
- Children cuddled to sleep will look for the parent when they wake and the parent has "vanished"
- Whatever conditions exist at sleep onset become the expected conditions when the child wakes between sleep cycles

**The physical contact distinction:**
- Being in the room is fine
- It is the **physical contact** that serves as a sleep crutch helping the child to the next sleep cycle
- The goal is gradually helping the child learn to fall asleep in their bed without the parent holding them

**Timeline and expectations:**
- This process takes **a couple of months** to do gently
- It is well worth it because the child develops the ability to put themselves back to sleep
- All kids develop this skill eventually; parents doing this are simply helping children develop it sooner
- Like any time we push kids to do what we want rather than what they want, we have to understand their point of view and be patient

**Age-appropriate caveat:**
- A 21-month-old is young for this lesson
- It's a lot to ask, especially when they are about to have a new sibling
- But as long as the parent stays present, patient, and understanding, the child will learn

### Step 5: Consider the Family Bed

**Prerequisites for this step:**
- The child has learned to put themselves to sleep without the parent holding them
- The child has no physical crutches outside their control (pacifier, bottle)
- If they still awaken at night after these conditions are met, they are asking for parenting

**The core reframe:** Parenting doesn't stop just because it is dark.

**How the family bed works for sleep:**
- Move the child into the parents' room (not necessarily the same bed if it's too crowded)
- Most toddlers who sleep with their parents wake up LESS at night because they feel the security of the parents' presence
- When they wake slightly, they reach out and touch the parent and go right back into the next sleep cycle knowing all is right with the world

**Important distinction:**
- This only applies once the toddler is no longer waking to nurse or have a bottle
- Kids who still depend on sucking to put themselves to sleep will wake MORE with the family bed arrangement

**The "arm's reach" factor:**
- Even being close by on a mattress on the floor usually helps the toddler sleep better because they know parents are available
- The child may want parents within arm's reach

### Step 6: Improvise to Offer Reassurance While Still Getting Sleep

**When family bed isn't possible:**
- Have one parent sleep in the room with the toddler
- This allows the parent to respond before the child wakes fully, making it easier for the child to go back to sleep
- It also eliminates the parent having to wake fully, so the parent gets better sleep

**Practical setup:**
- Sleeping bag and camping pad or other temporary, comfortable arrangement
- Knowing dad is right next to him is often so reassuring that the child sleeps much better

**How response changes:**
- If the child calls out, often a soothing word is enough to reassure them
- This is a temporary solution but might be all the grandchild needs to get over this hump of learning to sleep securely in their own bed all night

### Step 7: Adopt a Night-Time Parenting Mindset

**The cultural problem:**
- The culture has done families a disservice by letting them think it was normal for both parents to work full time with children at home
- It is personally challenging and there is no way something is not sacrificed

**What gets sacrificed (pick your trade-off):**
- The relationship (at least for a time)
- Sleep
- Children's needs
- Money (by working less)
- Dr. Laura's vote: sacrifice housekeeping and money

**The spacing factor:**
- Spacing children closer together than two years is a risk factor for a reason
- You simply can't do it all with each child
- It's also "usual" for the older sibling to regress and awaken more often when a new baby arrives

## The Timing Dilemma

The advice acknowledges a fundamental tension in this specific situation:

- The solution will not be immediate
- Job pressures are immediate
- The new baby will add stress to everyone in the family, especially the toddler
- Addressing the issue now, before everyone is adjusting to the new baby, is better than waiting
- But even if sleep issues persist through the transition, meeting kids' needs during those tough, sleep-deprived nights pays off: they feel loved and lovable, even on the darkest nights

## What NOT To Do (Anti-Patterns)

1. **Don't let the child "cry it out"** hoping they'll learn to self-soothe. This is not how brain development works. The child learns to give up, not to self-soothe.

2. **Don't expect quick fixes.** The gentle process of teaching a child to fall asleep independently takes a couple of months.

3. **Don't ignore the connection deficit.** If both parents work full time, the child may need more nighttime parenting to feel secure, and trying to eliminate night waking may be working against a legitimate need.

4. **Don't cold-turkey remove the bottle.** The child's body has adapted to expect calories at night. Gradual dilution addresses the biological reality.

5. **Don't assume the child is manipulating.** The framework consistently interprets night waking as communication of legitimate needs: fear, connection, comfort during emotional processing.

## Key Distinctions and Nuances

**"Crutch" vs. presence:**
- Physical contact (holding, rocking) creates sleep-cycle dependency
- Being present in the room does not create the same dependency
- The parent can be close without being a crutch

**Giving up vs. learning:**
- A child who stops crying after being left alone has learned to give up on calling
- A child who stops waking after gradual, supportive changes has learned to self-soothe
- The observable behavior (sleeping through) can result from completely different internal processes

**Night waking as symptom:**
- Night waking can indicate need for calories (bottle habit)
- Night waking can indicate need for emotional processing (daytime feelings coming up at night)
- Night waking can indicate need for connection (especially with working parents)
- Night waking can indicate sleep-onset association (whatever conditions existed at bedtime are needed at each wake)
- The intervention must match the cause
