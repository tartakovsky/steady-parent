## Summary
This article addresses a parent's concern about their almost 8-year-old daughter struggling to fall asleep at night, particularly during the transition from summer to school routine. Dr. Laura Markham explains the physiological reasons behind sleep difficulties (stress hormones from over-tiredness) and provides a comprehensive 7-step approach to help children who have trouble falling asleep.

## Key Concepts

### The Over-Tiredness Cycle
- When children become over-tired, their bodies release stress hormones (cortisol and adrenalin) to keep them going
- These hormones stay in the bloodstream for over 24 hours
- This causes children to appear hyperactive and "revved up" while actually being exhausted
- The child described their feeling as "my body feels too cuckoo"

### Sleep Requirements
- Children around age 8 need an average of 10.5 hours of sleep per night
- If a child needs to be woken up in the morning, they are not getting enough sleep
- Morning wake-up time should guide bedtime adjustments

## Actionable Strategies

### 1. Optimize the Daily Routine (Afternoon)
- **Physical activity**: 1-3 hours of outdoor activity helps children sleep more readily
- **Laughter**: Roughhousing and play that induces laughter decreases stress hormones and increases bonding hormones (not right before bed)
- **No screen time**: Several hours before bedtime to allow melatonin production; screen light inhibits melatonin
- **Avoid stimulants**: No caffeine (stays in body 8-14 hours), limit sugar/desserts to weekends

### 2. Set an Earlier Bedtime
- Work backwards from required wake time plus sleep needs
- For 6:30am wake-up and 10.5 hours of sleep = asleep by 8pm
- Adjust bedtime earlier until child can wake naturally at the target time

### 3. Wake Child Earlier Consistently
- Even though it increases tiredness temporarily, it helps establish the schedule faster
- Be patient with resulting crankiness
- Exhaustion will eventually outweigh stress hormones

### 4. Start Bedtime Routine Much Earlier
- If goal is asleep by 8pm, lights should be off by 7:30pm
- Children staying up late often have to "keep themselves wired" just to stay awake
- Recommended routine start: 7pm for a 7:30pm lights-out

### 5. Create a Regular Bedtime Routine (Sample Schedule)

**6:30pm - Bath**
- Add calming aromatherapy (lavender, vanilla, or jasmine)
- Give relaxing hand rub
- Ask about one good thing from their day and something they look forward to tomorrow

**7:00pm - Bedroom**
- Dim the lights
- Tuck in stuffed animals
- Read 2 short storybooks or a chapter (not too exciting)

**7:30pm - Lights Out**
- Play lullaby music (creates sleep association over time; choose a long one that won't end while falling asleep)
- Use EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) tapping on acupressure points with calming affirmations
- Say goodnight to each body part with gentle massage ("Good night shoulder... good night arm...")
- Use progressive relaxation: guide child to notice and relax each body part from feet upward

### 6. Use Guided Relaxation Audio
- Helpful for children whose minds race even with music
- Different from audiobooks which are designed to be engaging
- Worth trying different options to find what works

### 7. Lie Down with the Child
- Children fall asleep faster with an adult present
- This is a temporary measure until good sleep habits are established
- Once the child is used to falling asleep quickly, this won't be needed

## Key Techniques Mentioned

### EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique)
- Tapping on acupressure points while giving positive messages
- Proven to be relaxing
- Example affirmation: "Even though you were a little wound up, now you are relaxing"

### Progressive Relaxation
- Verbally guide the child to notice and relax each body part
- Use a calm, relaxed voice
- Work from feet upward through the body
- Describe body parts as "heavy" and "sinking into the bed"

### Sleep Associations
- Consistent use of lullaby music creates a trigger for sleepiness
- Aromatherapy scents bypass the thinking brain to trigger relaxation
- Regular routines help the body release sleep hormones like melatonin

## Parent Feedback
The parent who asked the question reported success:
- Child fell asleep 30 minutes earlier than usual on the first night
- EFT helped both child and parent relax
- Found the advice helpful and planned to continue with the recommended strategies

## Target Audience
- Parents of children (particularly ages 6-10) who struggle with falling asleep
- Families transitioning between different schedules (summer to school)
- Parents dealing with children who appear hyperactive but are actually overtired
