# Spring-Cleaning for Your Psyche: Transforming Your Inner Critic

## The Core Problem: Negative Self-Talk in Parents

The article opens with a parent's question that captures a universal struggle: when stopping to take a breath, she notices an overwhelming amount of negative thoughts - typically criticizing her abilities as a mom, wife, employee, daughter, or friend. The feeling of not doing anything well becomes pervasive.

This experience of feeling "not good enough" affects all parents at times. Sometimes this stems from genuinely impossible situations where there simply isn't enough of one person to go around (parents of multiples, closely spaced children, or really any two children face this). However, the deeper issue is that regardless of the objective situation, people get stuck in **negative thought habits** that beat them down, making bad situations worse.

The key insight: If we could support ourselves to feel like we were more than enough, we might be able to make peace with even a tough situation. This self-support is the first step toward actually improving the situation.

## Why the Mind Defaults to Negativity

### The Mind's Negativity Bias

The mind's negativity bias is constantly "on" because the mind's job is to spot potential problems and set off alarms. It constantly scans for threats, including our own imperfections. The mission of the mind is survival, so it's motivated mostly by fear. Happiness is barely in its job description.

### Childhood Reinforcement

The mind's tendency toward negativity is often reinforced by messages received in childhood. As **Peggy O'Mara** famously said: "Our parents' tone of voice with us becomes our inner voice." Even people raised with a generally positive self-view still experience the mind's tendency toward worry that wears them down.

### Neural Pathway Entrenchment

Brain research shows that minds are constantly looping through thought patterns that get etched into neural pathways with frequent use. This often manifests as a familiar cascade:

*"My child is doing X... I must be a terrible parent... and a worthless human being... This is an emergency... I have to MAKE my child act differently!"*

This pattern has various names: the **monkey brain**, the **lizard brain**, or what this article calls the **inner critic**.

## The Promise: You Can Transform Your Inner Critic

The good news is you can disarm your inner critic and even transform it into an **inspired inner parent** - something everyone needs. The problem isn't the mind itself; it's the bad habits the mind develops when we aren't self-disciplined about what our mind is doing.

These aren't new ideas - they're time-honored mindfulness strategies designed to address this most fundamental challenge all humans face. Research shows that practicing any or all of these techniques over time will rewire your brain, increasing neural connections that help you regulate emotions better and making you less reactive. The result: becoming a more patient, peaceful parent, and finding life inside your head happier too.

## The Three Categories of Strategies to Disarm Your Inner Critic

All strategies to disarm the inner critic fall into three categories:

1. **Bring awareness to the activity of your mind**
2. **Change what your mind thinks and says**
3. **Give your mind a vacation**

## Foundational Practice: Observing Your Inner World

### Step 1: Become Aware of Your Thoughts

Stop. Take a breath. Just sit for a few minutes with attention turned inward and notice the thoughts that arise. The key instruction: Don't try to change anything. Just observe.

### Step 2: Notice How Thoughts Trigger Emotional Waves

Thoughts trigger small waves of emotion in a continuous flow. The article provides a detailed example of how this cascade works:

- You might think about newly blooming flowers outside and feel a glow
- Then suddenly remember something you forgot to take care of, and feel a bit anxious
- That cascades: "One more thing to add to the list... All this work, taking care of everyone else"
- You realize you feel tired, unappreciated... a bit hurt and resentful
- You might think "It's time to get the kids to start helping more"
- But you can imagine the fight that will result
- Are your kids growing up lazy and undisciplined?
- You must be doing something wrong
- Fear clenches in your belly
- Maybe a muffin would make you feel better?

This demonstrates how quickly negative thoughts spiral into more negativity. Each negative thought triggers upsetting emotions, which lead to more negative thoughts and anxiety. Then come the coping mechanisms we all use to manage that anxiety, like eating or pulling out our phones.

### Step 3: Realize You Don't Have to Believe Your Thoughts

This is a crucial shift in perspective: Your thoughts are not gospel. Many of your thoughts are not even true - they're just fears, or habitual reactions, or conclusions you came up with long ago based on limited evidence.

**Example challenge**: Who says you're not good enough? Let that one go right now.

Once we become aware of our thoughts, we can stop automatically believing them, which means we stop acting on them. The metaphor offered: It's like sunshine melting away the fog.

## The Daily Practice: Stop, Drop, and Breathe

The recommended practice for implementation:

Take as many opportunities as you can to **Stop, Drop what you're doing, and Breathe** for a minute or two. Notice the chatter in your mind. If the thoughts are negative, challenge them with two questions:

### Question 1: "Is that absolutely, definitely true?"

Hint provided: If it's about the future, it cannot be absolutely true.

### Question 2: "Is there another way to see this situation that is also true and that empowers me to act more positively, or helps me see things from the other person's perspective so we can find a win/win solution?"

Hint provided: There always is.

## The Outcome of This Practice

Notice how this process gives you a choice about how to feel and respond, instead of getting swept away by the emotions the thoughts trigger. Notice how your anxiety decreases.

The closing reframe: You're choosy about who you spend time with, and what you put into your body. Why not choose to simply refuse admittance to any thoughts you don't want darkening your doorstep?
