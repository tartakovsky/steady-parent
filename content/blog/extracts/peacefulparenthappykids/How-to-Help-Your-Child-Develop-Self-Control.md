# How Children Develop Self-Control: Insights from the Marshmallow Test

## The Core Reframe: Self-Control is Self-Regulation, Not Willpower

The fundamental insight is that **self-control is actually a function of self-regulation**, not willpower as commonly assumed. This distinction matters because it changes how we approach helping children develop this capacity.

Walter Mischel, who created the marshmallow test, described self-control as "the ability to regulate hot emotions" - managing impulses and emotions so the child can make situations work for them and reach their own goals. This is explicitly not about marshaling willpower to accomplish things others regard as desirable, and not about meeting someone else's expectations.

The phrase from Mischel: "If you can deal with hot emotions, then you can study for the SAT instead of watching television, and you can save more money for retirement. It's not just about marshmallows."

## The Marshmallow Test: What It Actually Measures

### The Protocol

The researcher presents a child with a treat they like (marshmallow, cookie). They show the child there are additional treats in a tin. The researcher explains: "I need to leave the room for a few minutes. If you don't eat this treat while I'm gone, when I come back I will give you an additional treat from the tin. If you can't wait to eat this one, that's fine, but you won't get a second treat. If you can wait, then when I come back, I will give you the second treat as well as this one."

### Age-Based Results

- **Toddlers**: Virtually all eat the treat immediately after the researcher leaves. Their brain development isn't sufficient to control impulses, even to meet a goal important to them. They may want to wait, but cannot.
- **Preschoolers**: About 70% cannot control impulses enough to wait, even when they want the second treat.
- **Successful preschoolers**: About 30% can control themselves enough to wait.

### What the Test Really Shows

The question being measured is whether a child can manage their impulses in order to meet their own goals. This is framed as "the child's emerging self-mastery, which allows him, in turn, to master the world."

The ability to delay gratification is described as "a huge accomplishment" and an indicator of developing self-mastery.

## The Debunked Claim vs. What Remains Valid

### What Was Debunked

The original claim that a child's self-control at age three predicts their success in life has been "completely debunked." When researchers controlled for socioeconomic factors, the predictive validity of the test doesn't hold. Across large and diverse populations, whether children can resist the treat has no relationship to their later success in life.

### What Remains Valid

The Bing Nursery School (where Mischel's studies were conducted) emphasizes: "These studies demystified willpower and showed how self-control and emotional regulation could be enhanced, taught and learned, beginning very early in life, even by children who initially had much difficulty delaying gratification."

This is the actionable takeaway: self-regulation can be developed. A child who grabs and eats the treat immediately is not doomed - they can learn these skills.

## Brain Development and Self-Regulation

### Physical Brain Differences

Brain scans find actual physical differences between adults who could delay at age four and those who couldn't:
- **High delayers**: More active prefrontal cortex when trying to control responses to temptations
- **Low delayers**: More active ventral striatum when trying to control responses to temptations

### Nature vs. Nurture in Brain Development

Many researchers believe these brain differences are not innate but result from different experiences during the first four years of life. The reasoning:

1. The brain takes shape in response to how we use it, especially in the first five years
2. Repeated experience of choosing to control an impulse to achieve a higher goal strengthens the prefrontal cortex
3. "Practicing self-discipline builds the brain muscle to self-regulate"

Children who are more stressed by their experiences have a harder time self-regulating (this is also true for adults).

### The Critical Catch

The child must be the one choosing to exercise self-discipline - choosing to give up something they want (one marshmallow) for something they want more (two marshmallows). This internal choice and agency matters for building the capacity.

## Strategies Children Use (and Their Effectiveness)

Children in the studies developed various strategies to avoid eating the marshmallow:

- **Less effective**: Stroking the marshmallow lovingly (the treat quickly reached the child's mouth)
- **Effective**: Covering the marshmallow so it wasn't visible and focusing on a toy instead

The ability to distract themselves with strategies isn't simply a question of IQ - it likely involves creativity as well as emotional regulation to hold impulses in check.

Simple techniques to manage the mind can be taught and help children succeed at delayed gratification. However, we don't yet know how well learned techniques for this specific task translate into more control in real life. What we know about the brain suggests a child would need to "practice" those techniques regularly to sustain those skills.

## The Trust Factor

Research found that if the researcher purposely made himself seem unreliable (for instance, by promising toys that turned out not to be in the room), children were much more likely to eat the first treat immediately.

This is framed as "a smart response if you don't trust the adult to keep their promises." Some children have grown up in situations where "if you don't eat now, there might not be food later" - they've learned that going for immediate gratification is smarter.

This means children from food-insecure backgrounds could not be reliably tested using this protocol.

## The IQ Question

### What IQ Actually Measures

The article is skeptical of IQ as a concept, suggesting it measures a combination of:
- Environment and privilege (how much parents were able to read to and speak with the child)
- Executive function (which is influenced by emotional intelligence - children who manage emotions better manage themselves better in general)
- Environmental stress (children who experienced more stressful environments perform worse on IQ tests)

### Why IQ Doesn't Explain the Results

In Mischel's original sample, all children were from families who worked at Stanford or were grad students - "a highly intelligent subsection of the population" from uniformly privileged backgrounds. Yet even within this cohort, there were significant differences in outcome. This would be unlikely to come just from intelligence since all these kids would have scored much higher than average on IQ tests.

The differences could have resulted from different levels of stress in the home.

## Modern Children Have More Self-Control

Comparing results across decades:

**Mischel's 1960s experiments:**
- About 1/3 waited the maximum time (10 minutes)
- About 1/3 tried strategies then ate within 6 minutes
- About 1/3 ate within the first 30 seconds without trying to wait

**Stephanie Carlson's 2002-2012 studies:**
- Only about 12% ate in the first 30 seconds
- Almost 60% waited the full 10 minutes

Other studies support this trend of children demonstrating more self-regulation today than in previous years.

## What Doesn't Develop Self-Regulation

### The French Parenting Myth

The book "Bringing Up Bebe" by Pam Druckerman claims French children have more self-control due to practices like:
- Training kids to wait for attention
- Following rigid schedules

**This is explicitly debunked.** Walter Mischel didn't actually test French children. There's no evidence these factors develop self-control or self-regulation.

In fact, the opposite is true: **self-regulation develops more quickly when parents are more responsive**, not when children are trained to wait for attention.

## Why Self-Regulation Helps Children

A child who can regulate their emotions can control their behavior, making them more likely to get what they want out of life. This is framed as why self-control helps kids become happier.

The capacity to manage impulses to meet one's own goals is something every child will eventually develop. The question is why it happens earlier for some - specifically, why some children develop their rational frontal cortex sufficiently to regulate their emotions, anxiety about getting the treat, and their impulses.

## What Parents Should Not Do

### Don't Test Your Child

The marshmallow test cannot be replicated at home to predict success. The test used a specific lab protocol and was not done with parents. Focusing on testing misses the point.

The point is that children CAN develop self-regulation in early childhood and it will help them achieve their goals. The question is HOW to help them develop that ability.

If you're raising an emotionally intelligent child, you don't need to test them - you know they're developing emotional regulation. The parent should instead ask themselves if they're doing the practices that develop self-regulation.

## Key Framework: The Real Question

The question to focus on: "Regardless of your child's innate ability, how can you raise a child who can manage her emotions, anxiety and impulses so that she can manage her behavior to accomplish her goals?"

A hint is provided: "Just notice your own ability to manage your emotions and behavior." This suggests parental modeling and regulation play a role in children's development of these capacities.
