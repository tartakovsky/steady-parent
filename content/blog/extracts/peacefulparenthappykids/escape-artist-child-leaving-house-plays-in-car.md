# Managing a Young Child Who Leaves the House Unsupervised

## The Core Situation

A 3-year-old boy repeatedly leaves the house without anyone knowing, goes outside even when told it's not time, and has taken car keys to play in the car unsupervised. The parent had previously allowed supervised car play (buckling seatbelts, operating automatic doors) and now wonders how to walk back that permission.

## Key Insight: Playing in the Car Was Not a Mistake

**Allowing supervised car play was not an error** - the problem is only the unsupervised access. This parallels how we handle other inherently dangerous activities: children can build a fire WITH us, but never alone. The activity itself is acceptable; the lack of supervision is what creates danger.

This reframe matters because it shifts the conversation from "I made a mistake by ever allowing this" to "this activity requires my presence." The parent doesn't need to explain why something previously allowed is now forbidden - they need to establish that it was always a supervised-only activity.

## Immediate Safety Intervention: High-Mounted Locks

**Install locks high on all exterior doors immediately.** This is framed as urgent because the stakes are life and death - Dr. Laura mentions knowing of a situation where a young child died in a car, noting it can happen quickly.

Specific requirements for the locks:
- Mount high enough that the child cannot reach even with a chair
- Must open without a key (otherwise it becomes a fire hazard for the family)

The inconvenience of high-mounted locks is explicitly acknowledged but dismissed as trivial compared to the risk. This is not a behavioral intervention or a teaching moment - it's a physical barrier that must be installed while other approaches develop.

## Understanding the Behavior: Limit-Testing

Dr. Laura suggests the child may be "looking to see where the limits are." This frames the escape behavior not as defiance or disobedience per se, but as a developmental need to understand boundaries. Three-year-olds are actively mapping their environment and their autonomy within it.

This interpretation doesn't change the safety response (locks are still mandatory) but it reframes the parent's emotional stance: the child isn't being "bad" - he's doing the developmental work of a 3-year-old, which happens to intersect with a genuine safety hazard.

## Secondary Theme: Parenting Without Partner Support

The parent mentions that not having her husband's support with peaceful parenting methods makes things difficult. Dr. Laura's response:
- Expresses hope that the husband will notice improvements and begin taking interest in the methods
- Notes this is a common pattern ("I hear that often from moms")
- Recommends the audio resource "I've Got Your Back" for this situation

The implicit framework: demonstrate results first, and skeptical partners often come around when they see the approach working.

## Side Note: Using Consequences vs. Losing Your Cool

The parent shares two contrasting experiences:

1. **Successful use of logical consequences with older daughter**: If she doesn't do routine tasks (shower, vitamins, homework), she loses TV for the evening. This is working.

2. **Losing composure on a class trip**: When daughter ran ahead and didn't listen to repeated instructions to stay with the group, the parent told her "her behavior was horrible." The parent felt horrible afterward but notes the daughter "was much better" after.

Dr. Laura doesn't directly address these, but they illustrate the parent's real situation: making progress with some tools (logical consequences) while still reverting to old patterns (criticizing the child's behavior/character) under stress. The parent is explicitly aware of the gap between what she's learning and what she does under pressure - "I do it wrong a lot, but I am trying."

## Encouragement for Imperfect Progress

Dr. Laura opens with "Good for you for continuing to learn and grow as a parent!" This validates effort over perfection. The parent explicitly states she does things wrong often but keeps trying - and this is affirmed rather than corrected.
