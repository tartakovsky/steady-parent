# What to Say to Your Child: A Framework for Difficult Moments

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids - "A Simple Guide for What to Say (Even in the Heat of the Moment)"

## The Core Insight: Attitude Matters More Than Words

What you say matters far less than the attitude behind it. Your child can feel your warmth and love even before you speak. When you do speak, your tone carries more weight than the words themselves.

This is liberating because it means you don't need perfect scripts. You need to regulate yourself first, then the words will follow naturally.

## The Three-Part Framework: Connection, Feelings, Solutions

When struggling for the right words in difficult moments, keep three basic guidelines in mind: **Connection, Feelings, Solutions**.

Using all three makes you a genius, but even using just one will get you and your child on the right track. Each one works like a magic wand on its own.

The prerequisite for all three: take a deep breath first so you can keep your voice calm and warm. Without this foundation, the specific words won't have the intended effect.

## 1. Connect First

**Parenting is 90% connection.** This is the foundational principle that explains why connection comes first in the framework.

Children cannot:
- Hear us
- Cooperate with our requests
- Feel good in their own skin

...unless they feel connected with us. Connection is not a nice-to-have; it's a prerequisite for everything else working.

**When everything's going wrong, start by connecting.** This seems counterintuitive because you want to address the problem, but without connection, addressing the problem won't work.

### Practical Applications of Connection

**When your child isn't listening:**
Instead of repeating yourself louder, try physical connection first.
- Put your hand on her arm
- Make eye contact
- Say gently "Hey, Sweetie" (use your child's name)

This sequence matters: physical touch, then eye contact, then gentle voice with name. It re-establishes the connection that makes hearing possible.

**When your child is whining:**
The conventional approach is to admonish: "Use your grown-up voice." This addresses the symptom, not the cause.

Instead, recognize that whining signals disconnection and unmet needs:
- Gather her into your arms (physical connection)
- Name what you observe: "You are feeling out of sorts, aren't you? Nothing seems to be working for you right now."
- Reframe the need: "I think maybe you're out of hugs! Let's see what we can do about that."

The phrase "out of hugs" is useful because it gives a concrete, fixable explanation for the child's state.

**When kids are fighting:**
- Get between them physically
- Put an arm around each one

This serves two purposes: it connects physically AND restores safety. Without safety, no productive conversation can happen.

Then say: "Let's everyone take a deep breath and calm down now... We can work this out."

The phrase "We can work this out" communicates confidence that a solution exists and that you'll find it together.

## 2. Empathize with Feelings

**Your child's behavior may need to be limited, but all feelings are allowed.** This distinction is critical. You can hold firm limits while still validating the feelings that arise in response to those limits.

The mechanism: once feelings are acknowledged, humans are much more willing to cooperate. This isn't manipulation; it's how emotions work. Feelings that aren't acknowledged get louder. Feelings that are acknowledged can be processed and released.

**Kids don't need everything they want. They DO need to feel understood.** This reframes what your job is. You're not failing by saying no. You're failing if they don't feel understood in the no.

### What Not to Do

When children express negative feelings, the common impulse is to correct, dismiss, or argue with the feelings:
- "You know better than that!"
- "How can you be so mean?"
- "You have plenty of toys, don't be greedy!"
- "You'll make new friends when we move."

These responses tell the child their feelings are wrong or unacceptable. The feelings don't go away; they go underground or get expressed more intensely.

### The Alternative: Acknowledge and Hold the Limit

**When a child says "I hate you, I wish I didn't have a sister!"**

Instead of "You know better than that!" try:
"You're so very mad right now; you want us all to know you are furious. You can tell your sister what you're mad about without attacking her."

This does three things:
1. Acknowledges the feeling ("so very mad," "furious")
2. Validates the need to express it ("you want us all to know")
3. Holds the limit on behavior ("without attacking")

**When a child is sad about moving:**

The impulse is to talk them out of sadness: "You'll make new friends when we move."

But **the only way out of an emotion is through**. The first step in letting go is to let yourself grieve. Trying to skip grief doesn't eliminate it; it postpones it.

Instead, validate what they're expressing:
"I hear how worried you are about the move, and about missing your friends. I know you love your friends, and it's hard to think about leaving them. I'm so sorry you have to go through this."

Notice: no attempt to fix, solve, or minimize. Just acknowledgment.

**When a child wants a toy you're not buying:**

Setup: You've taken your child to buy a present for a cousin. You warned her you won't be buying her anything today. She gets emotional about how much she NEEDS a toy.

The typical response combines multiple problematic elements:
- "You have plenty of toys" (dismisses her wanting)
- "Don't be greedy" (shames the feeling)
- "You know we can't afford that" (may or may not be true, but sounds like excuse-making)
- "I TOLD you we weren't buying anything" (implies she should have suppressed her feelings based on prior warning)
- "Don't you start crying" (forbids the emotional response)

Instead, acknowledge the feeling while holding the limit:
"You wish you could have that. It looks like a lot of fun. Not today, my dear."

When she persists (which is natural), acknowledge desire and empower her to achieve it:
"You REALLY love that, don't you? You wish you could have it. I see how much you want it. I wonder if you could earn enough to buy it for yourself? Or we could write it down on your birthday list, and if you still want it when it's your birthday, maybe we can swing it then."

This transforms the interaction from a power struggle into problem-solving while keeping the original limit intact.

## 3. Look for Solutions, Not Blame

**When tensions rise, it's easy to get swept into catastrophizing and blaming.** This is what happens naturally when you're stressed. But all that teaches your child is to catastrophize and blame.

**Instead, focus on helping your child look for solutions to the problem.** The problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills your children learn, with your support, will help them for the rest of their lives.

This is a shift in goal: from stopping the bad behavior to building the capacity to solve problems.

### What Not to Do

**Shutting down disagreement:**
"Can't you two stop fighting?!" This tells kids their disagreement is the problem, rather than their lack of skills in resolving it.

**Solving it for them:**
"Ok, it's your turn tonight, you can have your turn tomorrow night, and no more arguing about this!" This resolves the immediate situation but teaches nothing about how to resolve conflicts themselves.

**Barking orders:**
"Get your shoes on this minute!" This usually makes kids dig in their heels and move more slowly. Urgency and commands trigger resistance.

**Negative labels:**
"You are so forgetful! You'd lose your head if..." Negative labels are self-fulfilling prophecies. Children internalize how you describe them and then live into that description.

### The Alternative: Empower Problem-Solving

**When kids are bickering over something (like an iPad):**

Help them work together to find a solution:
"I hear loud voices... Looks like both of you want the iPad, and there's only one iPad... I wonder how we can solve this?"

Key elements:
- Describe what you observe ("loud voices")
- Name the problem without blame ("both want it, only one exists")
- Express curiosity about solutions ("I wonder...")

The "I wonder..." framing is powerful because it opens exploration rather than demanding an answer.

**When your child isn't ready to leave:**

Instead of commands, give responsibility:
Point to the picture chart by the door with a smile of encouragement: "It's almost time to go... I see you have your clothes on... what does this chart you made show you that you need to do next?"

This sequence matters:
1. Time orientation ("almost time to go")
2. Acknowledge what's done ("clothes on")
3. Reference their own tool ("chart you made")
4. Ask them to determine next step

The chart being one "they made" increases ownership. Even if you created it together, framing it as theirs increases buy-in.

**When your child forgets something (like a science book for a test):**

Instead of labeling ("You are so forgetful!"), empower problem-solving:
"Hmm... that IS a problem, because you need your science book to study for the science test. I wonder what you can do to solve this problem? Let's think of possible solutions together."

Key elements:
- Acknowledge the reality ("that IS a problem")
- Name why it matters ("you need it to study")
- Express curiosity ("I wonder what you can do")
- Offer collaboration ("Let's think together")

## Summary Framework

In the heat of the moment when you're struggling for words:

1. **Breathe first** - to get your voice calm and warm
2. **Remember: Connection, Feelings, Solutions**
3. **Use whichever one fits** - even one works

The framework's power lies in its simplicity. You don't need to remember complex scripts. You need to remember three words and apply whichever one is most relevant to the situation.
