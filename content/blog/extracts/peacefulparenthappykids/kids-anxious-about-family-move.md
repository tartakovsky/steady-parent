## Recognizing Anxiety in Children

When children are anxious about major life changes like a potential move, the anxiety often manifests as behavioral symptoms rather than direct verbal expression. Key signs include:

- **Clinginess** - the child wants to stay physically close to parents more than usual
- **Acting out** - behavioral problems increase as a way of expressing internal distress
- **Nightmares and sleep disruptions** - waking up screaming at night reflects the fear being processed during sleep

These behaviors are the child's way of communicating anxiety they may not have words for or may not consciously understand themselves.

## Core Approach: Address Fears Head-On

The fundamental principle is to address children's fears directly rather than avoiding the topic or hoping it will resolve on its own. Avoidance allows anxiety to grow and find other outlets (nightmares, acting out).

### Start with Unconditional Security Statements

Before asking about specific worries, establish a foundation of safety and permanence. This works because anxious children need to feel secure before they can open up about what frightens them.

**Example reassurance script:** "I know sometimes you feel a little worried, but I will ALWAYS keep you and the other kids safe, no matter what. We will always be together as a family. We will always take care of each other. We will always love each other. We will always have fun together, no matter what."

The key elements in this reassurance:
- Emphasizing **permanence** ("always") counters the child's fear that things will change in catastrophic ways
- Mentioning **the whole family** addresses potential fears about separation
- Including **fun** reminds the child that positive experiences will continue
- Using **"no matter what"** acknowledges uncertainty while asserting security

## Invitation to Share Specific Worries

After establishing safety, invite the child to share what's worrying them. This step is important because:
1. You may not know what specific fear the child has
2. Children's fears are often unexpected and may not match adult assumptions
3. The act of expressing fears itself reduces their power

### Critical Response Principle: Empathize, Don't Argue

When the child shares worries, the response must be pure empathy without trying to:
- Talk them out of feelings
- Argue that their fear is unfounded
- Immediately problem-solve

**Why this matters:** If children cannot express their feelings openly because they get argued with or dismissed, those feelings are more likely to emerge as nightmares or acting out. Suppressed emotions find indirect outlets.

**Example responses:**
- "Oh, you were worried about that spider in the kitchen? That was scary, huh?"
- "When you think about Daddy getting that new job and us moving, you worry about missing Grandma. I know, we would miss her an awful lot."

Notice these responses:
- Reflect back what the child said
- Validate the emotion as real and understandable
- Use "we" language when appropriate to show shared feelings

## Common Unexpected Fears Children Have About Moving

Children may have fears that wouldn't occur to adults because they don't fully understand how moving works. These include:

- **Fear that the family will split up** - If Daddy works in another state, some children assume the rest of the family won't be with Daddy
- **Fear of being left behind** - Some children worry the family will move and forget to take them
- **Fear of sudden abandonment** - Worry that the family will just leave the house one day without them

**Real example:** One little boy who was told the family was moving refused to sleep anywhere except next to his mother's bed so she couldn't leave without him. This demonstrates how children's anxiety can manifest in specific behaviors that reveal their underlying fear.

This is why asking open-ended questions about what worries them is essential - their actual fear may be something completely different from what you assumed.

## The Sequence: Empathy First, Then Reassurance

The order of operations is crucial:

1. **Let them express worries fully**
2. **Empathize with those specific worries** - and even share your own feelings ("maybe shed a few tears for the things you would miss in your current neighborhood")
3. **Only then offer reassurance** about the future

**Why this sequence matters:** Reassurance given before empathy feels dismissive. The child needs to feel their loss is acknowledged as real before they can accept comfort about what will replace it.

### Tailored Reassurance Based on Specific Worries

Once empathy has been given, reassurance should address the specific concern raised:

| Worry | Reassurance Approach |
|-------|---------------------|
| Missing school | "Your new town will have a terrific school" |
| Missing grandparents | "She will visit, and of course we will visit her" |
| Missing friends | This is harder - you must honor the loss first, then reassure about visits, email, phone calls, and that new friends are waiting |

**Important nuance:** Missing friends is described as "a harder sell" because friendships cannot be directly replaced the way a school can be. You must genuinely honor that loss rather than rushing to promise equivalent replacements.

## Using Fantasy to Build Security

Talking about your fantasy of what life could be like in the new town serves as a reassurance technique. The conversation should keep emphasizing:

- **"We will all be together"** - family unity is maintained
- **Continuity of important things** - "We will take anything important to you: his bed, his toys, his pet"

The child needs to understand that their important possessions and connections will travel with them - the move doesn't mean losing everything they care about.

## Practical Strategies for General Anxiety and Clinginess

When a child is anxious and therefore clingy and acting out, the underlying goal is to help them feel more secure.

### Understanding the Child's Perspective

**Key insight:** "It may seem silly to you, but to him his very survival depends on you, and he is feeling afraid right now of losing you."

This reframe helps parents:
- Take the clinginess seriously rather than being annoyed by it
- Understand the behavior as fear-based rather than attention-seeking
- Respond with compassion rather than frustration

### Narrate Separations, Even Brief Ones

When separating from an anxious child, even for small separations like cooking dinner in the kitchen:

1. **Tell them where you are going**
2. **Tell them when you will be back**
3. **Don't ridicule the need to stay connected**
4. **Address it matter-of-factly without making a big deal of it**

**Example script for playground:** "You can stay close by me if you want, but I'll be right here on this bench if you want to play in the sandbox, and you can always look up and see me. We'll be at the park for half an hour, and then I will come and get you at the sandbox before we leave."

This script demonstrates:
- Giving the child choice ("close by me if you want")
- Providing physical anchor point ("right here on this bench")
- Ensuring visual connection possibility ("you can always look up and see me")
- Being specific about time ("half an hour")
- Explaining what happens next ("come and get you at the sandbox before we leave")

The specificity and predictability reduce anxiety by eliminating unknowns.

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't avoid the topic** - unexpressed fears come out as nightmares and acting out
- **Don't argue with feelings** - "You shouldn't worry about that" dismisses the child's experience
- **Don't ridicule clinginess** - it's a legitimate expression of survival-level fear
- **Don't rush to reassurance before empathy** - it feels dismissive
- **Don't assume you know what they're worried about** - children's fears are often unexpected
- **Don't pretend losses aren't real** - especially with friendships, genuine losses must be honored before moving to reassurance
