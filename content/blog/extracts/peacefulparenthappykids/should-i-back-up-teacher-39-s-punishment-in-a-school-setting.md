## Core Recommendation: Do NOT Back Up School Punishment at Home

The central guidance is clear: **do not reinforce or double down on punishments your child received at school**. Instead, respond with empathy and connection when your child comes home after a difficult day.

## Why Not to Add Home Consequences for School Behavior

### The Risk of Negative Self-Identity

When parents pile on additional punishment at home for what happened at school, the child may "come to think of herself as bad." This internal labeling becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once a child adopts a "bad" identity, they begin to "act 'bad' at home, too." The double punishment reinforces shame rather than building skills.

### Home Must Be a Safe Place for Emotional Processing

Children need a **safe place to come home and offload** how difficult their experience was. If home becomes another place of judgment and punishment, the child loses their emotional refuge. The unprocessed difficult feelings then manifest as behavior problems at home as well.

## The Recommended Response: Empathy and Listening

### Opening Statement

Start with an empathetic observation rather than interrogation or disappointment: **"It sounds like a hard day today."** This invites the child to share rather than defend.

### Listen and Empathize

Allow the child to tell you about it on their terms. Reflect back what you hear with empathy:

- "It sounds like you were so excited..."
- "It was hard for you to stop throwing toys and climbing..."
- "What did the teacher say?"
- "What did the teacher do?"
- "How did you feel?"
- "That sounds hard."
- "I am so sorry it was so hard for you."

This sequence moves from acknowledging the child's internal state (excitement), to the behavioral challenge (difficulty stopping), to exploring the external response (teacher's actions), to processing the emotional impact (how the child felt). The progression allows the child to make sense of the whole experience.

## Understanding the Behavior: Excitement Without Skills

### The Pattern Described

The example child (2.5 years old) gets "so excited that she doesn't know how to show her emotions." She smiles big, runs up to friends, and then hits them. The parent describes needing to "keep a close eye on her" during play.

### The Interpretation

This is not malicious behavior. The child "wants to play but doesn't know how to initiate it." The excitement overwhelms her ability to regulate and choose appropriate actions. She lacks the skills, not the good intentions.

## Explaining the Difference Between Home and School

### The Framework

You can explain to your child the practical difference between contexts:

- **At home or when you are with her**: You help her calm down and control herself (co-regulation)
- **At school**: There are too many children, so teachers use timeouts instead because they cannot provide the same individual support

### Key Nuance: Neither Party Is Wrong

**"You don't have to make the teacher wrong, but you also don't have to make your daughter wrong."** This is a both/and approach. The teacher is doing what they can given the constraints. The child is doing her best given her developmental stage. The parent's job is to hold space for both realities.

## Developmental Confidence

The guidance includes reassurance that "she will learn what is acceptable in school and she will learn to control herself." This is a matter of development and practice, not a moral failing requiring punishment to correct. The child is 2.5 years old, this is normal development in progress.

## Context Factors Mentioned

- The child is 2.5 years old
- She has a 3-month-old sister (so no practice with sibling play at home)
- Her only school experience has been Bible classes
- She is starting preschool in the fall (two mornings a week)
- The behavior occurs in contexts of excitement and social initiation

## What NOT to Do

- Do not add additional punishment at home to "support" the teacher
- Do not approach the situation as requiring you to "do more" to prevent future incidents through consequences
- Do not frame the child as having a character problem ("bad")
- Do not interrogate or express disappointment before listening
- Do not dismiss or ignore what happened

## Summary of the Approach

1. Receive the information from the teacher without visible distress
2. Connect with your child empathetically ("hard day")
3. Listen to their experience
4. Reflect back their feelings
5. Help them process the emotional difficulty
6. Explain the difference between home support and school management matter-of-factly
7. Trust that learning will happen through development, not through punishment escalation
