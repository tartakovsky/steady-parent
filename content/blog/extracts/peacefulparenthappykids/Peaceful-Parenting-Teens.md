# Peaceful Parenting from a Teen's Perspective: Long-Term Effects and Practical Examples

Source: https://www.peacefulparenthappykids.com/read/Peaceful-Parenting-Teens

This document provides a first-person account from a young adult (Tess, age 22) reflecting on how peaceful parenting shaped her moral and emotional development. The value lies in demonstrating the long-term outcomes of specific parenting responses, showing the connection between parental actions and lasting psychological effects.

## Core Thesis: Parental Responses Have Long-Term Psychological Effects

A parent's actions and reactions, no matter how small, have long-term psychological effects on children. How parents relate to their children, through good times and especially bad, will have lasting effects on the future parent-child relationship and the child's worldview. Many adult children can point to specific parental reactions that triggered long-term emotional characteristics, both good and bad.

**Key insight:** The author attributes who she became to her parents' parenting, not to being an "easy child" with a naturally agreeable disposition. She explicitly rejects the idea that her optimistic nature made her easy to raise, stating: "I didn't raise myself, and I am who I am because of their parenting."

## The Accessibility of Peaceful Parenting

The author's parents were not parenting experts. They had no training or PhDs in child psychology. Her older brother was born the same year "How to Talk So Kids Will Listen" was published, meaning they didn't have access to modern parenting resources. Yet they "seemed to get a lot right."

**Implication:** Everyone already has the tools needed to be a peaceful parent; the challenge is knowing how to access them.

**Important caveat:** The author acknowledges her parents had favorable circumstances (a strong partnership, no major health or financial setbacks) that made parenting easier. However, she notes that "children of all moral stripes come from all backgrounds" and that she has friends raised by single parents who turned out fine, and friends from wealthy backgrounds who are deeply unhappy.

**Core principle:** It doesn't matter what material possessions you have; it matters who you are to your children.

## Practical Examples with Outcomes

### Example 1: Responding to Stealing (Age 7)

**Situation:** Child stole beads and a small wooden pop gun from a toy store. The gun fell out of her pant leg at home, revealing the theft.

**Parental response:**
1. Mother asked directly: "Tess, what is that?"
2. Followed with: "Did you steal that from the store?"
3. The question gave the child the opportunity to practice taking responsibility (the child recognized there was no point in lying since the parent already knew)
4. After the child admitted it, mother spoke in a quiet voice: "It is not okay to steal. We are going back to the store right now."
5. They drove back and the child returned the item to the store manager
6. Afterward, mother said: "Thank you. That was the right thing to do."
7. No further discussion after that

**What this taught:** Even when you make a mistake, there are ways to apologize and make amends. The child did not feel like a screw-up, just that she hadn't made the right choice.

**Long-term result:** She never stole anything again.

**Key elements:** No yelling, no shaming, quiet voice, immediate natural consequence (returning the item), acknowledgment of the child doing the right thing in making amends, then moving on without dwelling.

### Example 2: Managing Sibling Disputes Over Chores (Shower Negotiations)

**Situation:** Both children hated taking showers and would argue about who goes first.

**Parental response:** Father said: "You both have to take a shower tonight, it doesn't matter who goes first. I will flip this coin and you each pick a side; whoever wins picks who takes the first shower."

**What this taught:** Chores aren't so bad if you have some control in the decision-making process.

**Long-term result:** As an adult, she still doesn't like showers but uses the same technique on herself: "Tess, do you want to take a shower tomorrow morning or tonight? It's up to you, but you have to do it no matter what."

**Key principle:** Giving children agency within non-negotiable boundaries makes compliance easier and teaches self-regulation.

### Example 3: Permission to Quit (Gymnastics Burnout, Age 15-17)

**Situation:** After 10 years of gymnastics starting at age 7, the child burned out around 15 and started dreading practice despite having loved it for years.

**Parental response:** After multiple breakdowns in tears after grueling workouts, mother said: "Do you still want to do this? It's not making you happy. It's okay to quit if you want."

**Critical moment:** After winning first place at a meet, the child cried because there were still four weeks of practice left. Mother's response: "Is this something you still want to do? You can quit any time you want."

**What this taught:**
- Just because you've always done something doesn't mean you are less of a person if you stop
- It's important to listen to yourself, especially if you're doing something that makes you sad
- **The response after winning was especially influential:** It doesn't matter what tangible successes you achieve; something is only worth doing if you like it

**Long-term result:** She stuck with the sport until 17 due to team spirit and supporting her high school (her own choice). When faced with a similar situation in college, she felt comfortable leaving and didn't see it as "giving up" because she was listening to herself.

**Key insight:** Parents explicitly separating external success (winning) from internal experience (unhappiness) taught that achievement doesn't obligate continued suffering.

### Example 4: Academic Struggle (Failing AP Calculus, Grade 11)

**Situation:** After a lifetime of all A's, the child failed the first AP calculus exam and got a D on the first report card.

**Parental response:** Both parents, repeatedly: "Calculus is notoriously difficult. What are you finding hard in the material? Talk to the teacher about getting extra help."

**What this taught:** You will face difficulties in school and life, and there are people around to help. There is no weakness in asking for help when you need it.

**Long-term result:** She eventually asked to see a tutor on her own initiative.

**Key elements:** Normalizing struggle ("notoriously difficult"), curiosity about the specific challenge, pointing toward resources, not expressing disappointment about the grade.

---

### Example 5: Responding to Academic Improvement (Calculus Grade Raised to B)

**Situation:** Child brought the calculus grade up from a D to a B.

**Parental response:** "What concepts were the hardest? How do you feel about calculus now that you understand it more?"

**What this taught:** They didn't care about the improved grade, just that she had overcome challenges and learned new material. She found she liked calculus, even though she didn't get it at first.

**Long-term result:** She internalized that the purpose of school and education is to learn and master challenging material, not to get good grades. This had lasting effects on her educational performance and happiness in college.

**Key principle:** Questions focused on learning and mastery rather than the grade itself communicate values about the purpose of education.

---

### Example 6: Stress and Overwhelm (College Application Breakdown)

**Situation:** Child had a breakdown while writing college and scholarship application essays, sobbing "I just don't want to write any more essays!"

**Parental response:** Mother: "You've been working so hard on these; I know it's really stressful. Go take a break. Breathe a little. When you're ready to continue, do you want some help?"

**What this taught:** Stress is a natural part of hard work, but it doesn't have to cripple you. Take a break, breathe, and slowly work through it.

**Long-term result:** She finished the essays. She manages stress well as an adult.

**Key elements:** Acknowledging the effort ("You've been working so hard"), validating the stress ("I know it's really stressful"), giving permission to pause ("Go take a break"), offering support when ready ("do you want some help?").

---

### Example 7: Handling Rejection (College Rejections)

**Situation:** Child was rejected from 6 out of 7 colleges she applied to, including all top choices.

**Parental response:** Both parents: "This really sucks, but let's be grateful you still have one more option. Let's think of ways that the one remaining college is a good fit for you."

**What this taught:** After acknowledging an initial disappointment, choose to be optimistic and grateful for what you have. You don't always get your first choice, but that doesn't mean you can't learn to love your seventh.

**Long-term result:** She had a fabulous college experience. She has not let subsequent rejections (scholarships, jobs) stop her from trying.

**Key elements:** Validated the disappointment first ("This really sucks"), then shifted to gratitude and problem-solving, reframed remaining option positively.

### Example 8: Natural Consequences Without Punishment (Driving Infractions)

**Situation:** Both children got in small car accidents the same week; one also got a parking ticket. The father, having never used grounding as a punishment, had to figure out how to respond.

**Parental response:** Father, fumbling for words: "I don't know how to say this exactly, but I think you guys should take some time off from driving to think about your skills. I will take you for practice if that would help."

Brother: "Okay, that makes sense. Sorry again about the accident."

Child: "Sure, sounds fair. How long are we talking here?"

Father: "...A week? Does that sound good?"

Both children: "Sure, that sounds good."

End of discussion, no ill will.

**What this taught:** Mistakes and bad behavior can have consequences, especially in the "real world." When a person in authority responds to bad behavior with a fair explanation of the consequences and reasonable and appropriate restriction of rights, all parties are more willing to comply and learn from the mistakes. This method is better than threatening or punishing.

**Long-term result:** Neither child committed any driving infractions since.

**Key elements:** Father explained his reasoning ("think about your skills"), offered support ("I will take you for practice"), negotiated the duration with the children, children agreed it was fair, no resentment generated.

**Important nuance:** The father's uncertainty and willingness to negotiate communicated respect rather than weakness. The consequence made logical sense (time to reflect on driving skills) rather than being arbitrary punishment.

### Example 9: Building Trust Through Honest Communication (College Drinking Incident)

**Situation:** During first year of college, child was caught drinking in a dorm room. Many friends swore not to tell their parents and planned to lie to the judicial board to avoid punishment. The child called her parents the next morning because she didn't want to keep a secret from them.

**Parental response:** Father, calmly:
- "Are you okay?"
- "What did you tell them?"
- "The truth."
- "What are the consequences?"
- "A fine, community service, and a class."
- "Okay. I trust that you'll do what they ask. Does this make you think twice about your decision-making in the future?"
- "Yes. I will avoid those situations in the future and make smarter decisions."
- "That sounds about right. Thanks for telling us."

**What this taught:** If she makes a mistake or stupid decision, she can tell her parents and they won't get angry. Admitting when you're wrong builds mutual trust in the context of a larger discussion about peer pressure, decisions, and alcohol.

**Long-term result:** She reevaluated why she was drinking so much and reconsidered the effect peer pressure was having on her social activities. She did not stop drinking, but she was much safer about it.

**Key elements:** First question was about her wellbeing ("Are you okay?"), remained calm, expressed trust ("I trust that you'll do what they ask"), asked reflection questions rather than lecturing, thanked her for telling them.

**Critical insight:** The child chose to tell her parents voluntarily when she could have hidden it. This demonstrates the trust built through years of non-punitive responses. The relationship allowed for honest communication about risky behavior, which led to actual behavior change.

## Underlying Principles Demonstrated Across Examples

### Quiet, Calm Responses
Across all examples, parents spoke quietly or calmly rather than reacting with anger, even when children made serious mistakes (stealing, drinking, car accidents).

### Validation Before Problem-Solving
Parents consistently acknowledged feelings and difficulties ("This really sucks," "I know it's really stressful," "Calculus is notoriously difficult") before moving to solutions or expectations.

### Questions Over Lectures
Parents asked questions that prompted reflection ("What are you finding hard?" "Does this make you think twice?" "How do you feel about calculus now?") rather than delivering lectures about right and wrong.

### Focusing on Learning, Not Performance
Whether the topic was grades, sports victories, or mistakes, parents focused on learning, growth, and feelings rather than outcomes and achievements.

### Giving Agency Within Boundaries
Children were given choices and input on decisions (who showers first, how long the driving break should be, whether to quit gymnastics) even when the underlying requirement was non-negotiable.

### Natural and Logical Consequences
Consequences were connected to the behavior (returning stolen item, taking a break from driving after accidents) rather than arbitrary punishments designed to inflict discomfort.

### Trust as Foundation
The relationship was built on mutual trust. This manifested in children feeling safe to tell the truth, admit mistakes, and ask for help without fear of angry reactions.

### Moving On After Resolution
After addressing issues (stealing incident, driving discussion), parents didn't continue to dwell on or bring up past mistakes. The matter was resolved and then closed.

## What the Author Says About Punishment

The author explicitly notes that her father "never employed grounding as a punishment." When faced with the driving incident, he had to figure out how to respond because punishment wasn't his default tool.

The driving example demonstrates that appropriate restrictions can be implemented without the framework of punishment. The distinction appears to be:
- Punishment: arbitrary suffering imposed to teach a lesson
- Natural consequence: logical restriction connected to the behavior, explained and even negotiated

The college drinking example shows that external institutional consequences (fine, community service, class) were sufficient. The parents didn't add additional punishment. They trusted the existing consequences and focused on reflection and future decision-making.

## The Long-Term Trust Dividend

The most striking demonstration of peaceful parenting's effectiveness is the college drinking incident. While peers hid their infractions from parents, this child voluntarily called her parents the next morning. She explicitly states: "I didn't want to keep a secret from them."

This level of openness with parents about risky behavior during the college years is the accumulated result of years of non-punitive responses. The child had learned through experience that:
- Telling the truth wouldn't result in anger
- Her parents would help her think through situations
- Admitting mistakes strengthened rather than damaged the relationship

This trust enabled the parents to have influence on her thinking about peer pressure and alcohol even when they weren't physically present, which is the entire challenge of parenting teenagers and young adults.

## Credibility and Context Notes

The author (Tess) is the niece of Dr. Laura Markham (Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids) and worked as her assistant. Dr. Markham vouches for the accuracy of the parenting described, having observed it during Tess's childhood. Tess was not paid to write the account.

The author's father died at age 61, prompting her to reflect on and document the parenting she received. This personal context adds emotional weight but also means the account is written with gratitude and positive framing.

The author explicitly addresses skepticism about whether these techniques "really work" and whether children learn consequences without punishment. Her account serves as a data point for the long-term outcomes of peaceful parenting through adolescence and into adulthood.
