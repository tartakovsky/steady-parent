## Core Insight: Meaningful Conversation Requires Safety and Presence

The fundamental premise is that **family conversations can become opportunities for deep connection**, but only when approached with the right mindset. Parents often say they don't know where to begin to have a "real" conversation with their child, but the solution isn't complicated - it requires three things:

1. Ask good questions
2. Commit to listening and not lecturing
3. Enjoy the discussion and stay curious

The most important take-away for your child from these conversations will be **feeling heard, seen, and valued**.

## The Mechanics of Good Family Discussions

### The Danger of Lecturing

When you feel a strong need to make a point, take a breath. That feeling usually leads to lecturing, which will make your child tune you out. There's no threat in a conversation, and nothing to lose.

### Creating Safety for Vulnerability

If you can create enough safety in the conversation, your child may share something vulnerable. That might scare you as a parent. Remind yourself that your goal is to **connect at a deep level** - you don't need to have all the answers.

When your child shares something difficult, you just have to be present with them, so they are not alone with whatever they are sharing. If you feel anxious, use the technique: **Stop, Drop, Breathe**. Then connect nonverbally, warmly, with your eyes or physically, to provide safety.

**Simple response when you don't know what to say:** "I am really glad I know this. Thank you for telling me."

### The Phone Problem

Research shows that when a phone is in sight, conversations don't get as deep, and may not get started at all. Put all phones away for family discussions.

### Start by Sharing Your Own View

Don't shy away from expressing your opinions - kids are often curious what parents think. Just be sure that you listen first, and that you listen more than you talk.

## Key Principles for Using These Questions

**Use questions as jumping-off points:** Rather than badgering your child with multiple questions, use one as the jumping off point for a two-way conversation.

**Reflect back what you hear:** Listen to the answer and reflect back what your child is saying so they know you understand.

**Listen more than you talk:** Be sure that you listen first, and that you listen more than you talk.

**Stay curious:** The questions are meant to help you practice listening and enjoying your child, not to reach any particular conclusion.

**Trust the process:** Your child is likely to learn terrific life lessons from discussing these questions, but that happens through the process of working out their views and understanding themselves better because they have the opportunity to express themselves.

**Adapt for age:** These questions can be adapted for kids of all ages, from preschoolers through teenagers.

**Context matters:** These work well both to launch family dinner table conversations and for one-on-one time, as well as during family vacations and activities like hiking.
