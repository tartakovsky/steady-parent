# Hair Pulling as Self-Soothing Behavior in Toddlers

## Understanding the Behavior: Hair as a Lovey

**Core insight**: When a toddler persistently pulls a parent's hair, especially during comfort-seeking moments (falling asleep, tired, cranky), the hair has become functionally equivalent to a **lovey** - a comfort object that soothes through tactile engagement.

**Why hair becomes a lovey**: A lovey is defined as something you love because it soothes you. Hair qualifies because:
- It's attached to the parent, who is the "center of the universe" for the child
- It provides tactile stimulation for hands that "need to be busy"
- It's consistently available during intimate moments (holding, nursing, co-sleeping)

**Pattern recognition for this behavior**: The child in this case:
- Started hair pulling as an infant (around 9 months)
- Shows the behavior especially when tired, cranky, or falling asleep
- Always needs hands occupied (plays with blanket threads in crib, likes shaggy stuffed animals)
- Prefers parent's hair over substitutes when parent is available
- Is otherwise active, healthy, and developing normally

**This is not Trichotillomania**: At 16 months, this is too young for that diagnosis. The behavior is attachment and sensory-seeking, not a compulsive disorder.

**Why the pediatrician's advice ("put him down and say no every time") doesn't work well**: The parent found this "quite impossible" because:
- The behavior occurs during moments meant for connection and comfort
- Inconsistency is inevitable when the situations vary (falling asleep vs. car vs. general holding)
- Simply saying "no" doesn't address the underlying need for tactile soothing

## The Habit Won't Self-Extinguish

**Key warning**: This habit will not go away by itself. The reasoning: When a behavior has persisted for half the child's life (started at 9 months, now 16 months), it's deeply established as a soothing mechanism. Without intervention, the child has no reason to abandon what works.

**Why tolerating it "for now" creates problems**:
- The parent can't sleep during co-sleeping because the child pulls hair for extended periods (an hour)
- Holding and cuddling become painful rather than enjoyable
- The parent instinctively reduces closeness (moving child back to crib) which could affect the relationship

## The Solution: Redirect to an Alternative Lovey

### The Nursing Necklace Strategy

**The recommended tool**: A **nursing necklace** - not just for nursing, but as a safe tactile distraction that provides similar sensory input to hair.

**Implementation steps**:

1. **Make hair unavailable**: Tie hair back, ideally in a bun, and if possible cover with a scarf. The goal is physical inaccessibility, not just verbal prohibition.

2. **Introduce the substitute**: Start wearing the nursing necklace consistently when holding the child.

3. **Redirect gently but firmly**: When the child reaches for hair, guide their hand to the necklace instead.

4. **Maintain the boundary like a wall**: The parent should be "like the wall - he can push, but it will stay solid." This means:
   - Not defensive
   - Not angry
   - Not trying to "teach" anything
   - Just consistently not making hair available

### Handling the Emotional Response

**Expect crying**: The child will cry when redirected. This is natural disappointment at losing access to their special lovey.

**Why this crying is not harmful**: As long as the parent holds the child, listens, and empathizes, the crying is a healthy expression of disappointment - not trauma.

**The crying may be intense and repeated**: The child "may cry over and over, for several days" as they adjust to the new rule. This is normal adaptation, not a sign that the approach is wrong.

**How to respond during crying**:
- Stay kind and firm simultaneously
- Empathize verbally: "I'm sorry it's so hard... You miss my hair... Here's your necklace."
- Keep the hair covered/unavailable
- Continue redirecting to the necklace

**Reframe for secondary benefits**: The crying may allow the child to "offload any other anxieties" beyond just the hair issue, which supports overall emotional health.

### Practical Considerations

**Buy a backup immediately**: As soon as the child accepts the nursing necklace as the new lovey, purchase an identical second one. The reasoning: if the lovey breaks or gets lost, having an exact replacement prevents regression.

### If the Necklace Strategy Fails

**The nuclear option**: Cut your hair short. This is described as "radical" but pragmatic - hair grows back, and this definitively solves the problem by removing the target entirely.

**When to consider this**: If the child "doesn't accept the new necklace lovey, and keeps fighting to get to your hair" despite consistent implementation of the redirect strategy.

## What NOT to Do

**Inconsistent responses**: Telling the child "no" sometimes, letting it happen other times, redirecting other times - this inconsistency prevents the child from understanding the new rule.

**Treating it as misbehavior**: The child isn't being "bad" - they've developed an attachment to a sensory experience. Punishment or anger misframes the situation.

**Worrying about the "source" of the habit**: Dr. Laura explicitly says not to worry about finding some psychological source. The explanation is straightforward: active child + hands that like to be busy + available hair + soothing sensation = hair becomes lovey.

**Expecting verbal instruction to work alone**: Showing the child to "pat softly" had "little impact" because at 16 months, impulse control is minimal and the urge for the familiar soothing behavior is strong. Physical unavailability (covered hair) is more effective than verbal requests.

## Related Examples of Similar Attachments

Other body parts that babies become attached to as loveys:
- Mother's mole
- Mother's armpit
- The other nipple (during nursing)

These examples illustrate that the hair attachment is a normal variation of infant comfort-seeking, not something pathological or unusual.
