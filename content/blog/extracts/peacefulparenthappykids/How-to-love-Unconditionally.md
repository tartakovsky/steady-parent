## Core Framework: Love as Action, Not Feeling

**Love is not a feeling but an action** - the deliberate act of creating love where there wasn't any. This reframing is central to the entire approach. Love is the hard internal work you do to shift from your automatic reaction of anger into a place of connection, emotional generosity, and compassion.

This matters because feelings happen to us, but actions are choices. If love were merely a feeling, we would be at the mercy of our emotional states. By defining love as action, it becomes something we can practice and develop regardless of how we feel in the moment.

**Compassion is described as "the heavy lifting of life"** - requiring daily practice to build the necessary capacity, just like physical muscle development. Your heart is not an exception to the principle that strength requires consistent exercise.

## The Foundational Commitment

The starting point is a commitment to treat yourself and everyone around you with compassion. Every time you notice harshness creeping in - toward yourself, your child, or anyone else - stop and find something to appreciate about that person. No exceptions.

This is framed as a radical practice: "If you could choose compassion in every interaction with everyone, including yourself, you'd be enlightened by the end of the month."

## The Real Challenge: Love Under Stress

It's easy to be loving when everything goes our way. The real test comes when:
- You're stressed out
- Your desires are thwarted
- Your needs aren't met
- You're in fight or flight mode
- Even the people you love look like the enemy
- Life crashes into you and knocks you over

For parents, this happens at least once a day, and for some, many times a day. The practice is specifically about these difficult moments, not the easy ones.

## Reframing Others' Behavior

Before detailing the anger management steps, there's an important cognitive reframe about other people's difficult behavior.

**Your partner who seems "clueless and selfish"**: Maybe they are as overwhelmed as you are, but showing it in a different way. The same stress can manifest differently in different people.

**Your child who is "being impossible"**: Multiple possibilities to consider:
- They may be feeling disconnected from you
- Kids don't act out when they feel deeply connected, but connection gets frayed during daily life and has to be constantly renewed
- They may be afraid - of the mean kid at school, the monsters in the closet, losing your love to a sibling, or never being good enough for you to stop yelling at them

**Strangers who are rude or difficult**: They may just have had very hard days. You don't have to want to be near them, but you can think of them with compassion while removing yourself from their presence.

The key insight here is that **everyone is larger than their mistakes, even their big mistakes**.

## The Seven-Step Process for Managing Anger

### Step 1: Stop and Take a Deep Breath

The mechanism: Just the act of noticing your breathing and increasing the oxygen to your brain gives you a moment of choice. You don't have to act on whatever's triggering you.

The choice available in that moment: You could choose love right now and sort this out when you feel more compassion.

### Step 2: Recognize Your Anger as a Physiological Hijacking

Anger swamps you with "fight" hormones that:
- Shape your perceptions
- Limit your empathy
- Limit your problem-solving ability

The intervention: Take another deep breath and remind yourself that you are safe and you can handle this. This specific self-talk switches off what is called "the blood-wrath of self-defense."

### Step 3: See It from the Other Person's Point of View

Two practices combined:
1. Remind yourself that the other person is having a hard day too
2. Find something to appreciate about the other person

This connects back to the principle that everyone is larger than their mistakes.

### Step 4: Feel Without Reacting (Mindfulness Practice)

Notice the urge to react - that's your body ready to fight. Nothing good will come of acting on that urge.

The practice has several parts:
1. **Instead of lashing out, NOTICE the sensations in your body** - just notice without taking action to relieve the feelings. This is described as mindfulness.
2. **Remind yourself that you're safe**
3. **Offer compassion to yourself**: "It's so hard when you're angry, and this is something all humans feel"
4. **Breathe deeply and breathe out the anger**
5. **Notice if it diminishes**

The self-compassion piece is significant - acknowledging the difficulty and the universality of the experience.

### Step 5: Move Your Body to Shift the Anger (If Still Needed)

Physical options:
- Shake out your hands
- Splash water on your face
- Put on music and dance
- Do five sit-ups (framed with humor: "At the very least, you'll feel stronger and fitter!")

**Critical warning**: It does NOT help to hit something. That signals to your body that you're in danger and does not diminish the "threat" response you're feeling. This is a common misconception about releasing anger.

### Step 6: Ask What's Under Your Anger

The insight here is that anger usually connects to older wounds. Example: If someone made you feel disrespected, the button that just got pushed is probably from feeling disrespected in your own childhood or in other circumstances in your life.

This reframe: "This is an opportunity to heal that!"

**The self-respect principle**: Even if that person actually DID disrespect you, you have all the respect you need inside yourself. Find that self-respect inside and give it to yourself.

Important clarification: "I'm not suggesting that you let yourself get walked on. I'm suggesting that no one can take your self-respect away. You can always retain your dignity and take responsibility for your own emotional regulation."

### Step 7: Take Care of Yourself

Anger is a signal that you need something. The task is to identify that deep need and meet it.

**Critical distinction**: Your job is not to control the other person. It's to deal with your own experience and reactions, and to give yourself care in this tough moment. You may need to set a boundary, but you can do that without judgment, criticism, or controlling the other person.

Questions to identify your needs:
- Do you need to physically move yourself to a place where you feel safe and can re-center yourself?
- Do you need a good cry?
- Do you need to give yourself permission not to get it all done?
- Do you need to cut back your expectations and try again tomorrow?

**On the need to be heard**: Wanting your anger to be heard and acknowledged is a universal need when we're angry. Sometimes it makes sense to share those feelings with the other person, but only after you calm down and can state your perspective without it being an attack.

**Validation doesn't require the other person**: You can't control the other person's response, and often they can't give you the validation you want. But you don't need it from them. You can give that validation to yourself. Tell yourself exactly what you need to hear.

**The responsibility frame**: Now that you're a grown-up, it's your responsibility to give yourself what you need. Otherwise, you can't be the emotionally generous parent you want to be, and everyone loses.

## The Neurological Rewiring Mechanism

**Emotional self-regulation is described as "arguably the most critical emotional intelligence skill."** Most people don't come by it naturally.

The key mechanism: **Every time you resist acting when you're triggered, you're re-wiring your brain.**

The practice progression: The more you practice shifting from judgment to compassion as you move through your day and hit small roadblocks, the more you'll be able to shift into unconditional love in the toughest moments.

This suggests starting with smaller irritations to build capacity for bigger challenges.

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't hit something when angry** - it signals danger to your body and reinforces the threat response rather than diminishing it
- **Don't share your feelings with the other person while still activated** - wait until you calm down and can state your perspective without it being an attack
- **Don't expect validation from the other person** - they often can't give it, and you don't actually need it from them
- **Don't try to control the other person** - this is not your job; focus on your own experience and reactions
