## Core Principle: The Root of Sibling Rivalry

**Sibling rivalry is universal** because siblings compete for resources that can seem scarce, specifically the parent's time and attention. This competition is natural and expected.

The most important intervention: ensure each child knows that no matter how much their sibling gets, there is always more than enough love for them. This addresses the fundamental fear driving rivalry - the fear of being replaced or receiving less.

## During Pregnancy: Building Connection Before Baby Arrives

### Validate All Feelings with Empathy

Let your child express the full range of feelings throughout pregnancy, birth, and afterward. Respond with empathy rather than dismissing or correcting emotions.

**Why this matters:** Your child will naturally feel some jealousy of the time and attention you and others give to the new baby. This jealousy is normal and healthy to express. Suppressing it doesn't make it go away - it just drives it underground.

**What to do:**
- Reassure with words AND actions that you adore them
- Spend "special" one-on-one time just with them each day
- While emphasizing advantages of being older, also reassure them they will always be your baby too
- Allow some "babying" of the older child
- If they want to "play baby," let them - they won't regress forever. This play is a way of processing their fears about being replaced.

### Strengthen the Partner Relationship

Cultivate the relationship between the older child and your partner throughout the pregnancy.

**The strategic reason:** When you're nursing the new baby nonstop after birth, you want your older child to be excited about spending time with their other parent. Building this relationship before the baby arrives means the older child has another secure attachment figure to turn to when you're less available.

### Create Ownership Through Involvement

The more ownership your child feels over the baby, and the less displaced they feel, the less jealousy they'll exhibit.

**Language matters:** Refer to "Our baby" or "Your sister" or even "Your baby." Using possessives like "my sister" or "my son" denotes relationship and belonging. (Note: No one "owns" the baby, who is a person in their own right. These possessives denote relationship, not property.)

**Concrete involvement activities:**
- Read books about childbirth together
- Take them to the doctor to hear the baby's heartbeat
- Let them pick out furniture, toys, and clothes
- Let them help paint the baby's room
- Ponder potential baby names together - if you can let them "name" the baby with a name you love, all the better
- Pack a bag for the hospital together that includes a photo of your older child

### Reinforce Individual Value

Your child has always been "the baby" and is about to be displaced. Now they become "big sister/brother." But they are also an individual who contributes to the family just by being themselves.

**How to reinforce this:**
- Note specific contributions: "Sara, I love the way you make me laugh" or "Kingston, I love the way you help me with the groceries like this!"
- Talk often about how each family member is important in their own way and makes their own special contribution
- Emphasize that the family needs each person for it to be whole

**Why specific praise matters:** Generic praise ("you're great!") doesn't build identity. Specific observations about what they contribute helps develop their sense of why they're still a valuable member of the family.

### Time Big Changes Strategically

Get any big changes out of the way well in advance of the birth:
- Room changes
- Weaning
- Toilet training

**The reasoning:** Your child needs time to make these new routines into habits without associating them with the baby. If they transition to a big bed the week before the baby arrives, they may feel "kicked out" to make room. If changes happen months earlier, they become normal life rather than displacement.

### Maintain Relationship Stability

Keep your relationship with your older child as smooth and affectionate as possible by:
- Sidestepping power struggles
- Minimizing conflicts

**Why now especially:** Your child needs to be secure in your love to handle the arrival of a sibling with equanimity. They will naturally be testing you to be sure you still love them. These tests need to be met with connection, not conflict.

### Celebrate Their History

Go through their baby pictures and talk about what a wonderful baby they were, and what a wonderful child they are now.

**What this accomplishes:** Emphasizes the older child's specialness, shows them they were once the center of your world as a baby too, and demonstrates that growing up doesn't mean losing your love.

## Preparing for the Birth Event

### Sibling Birth Classes

Consider sibling birth classes, which offer:
- Lessons on how to hold a baby
- Explanations of how a baby is born
- Opportunities for your child to discuss feelings about having a new sibling

**If doing education yourself:** Make sure your child understands that:
- Babies cry a lot at first
- Babies aren't ready to play for a long time
- The baby will always look up to big brother/sister
- The baby will want their attention and care

**Why realistic expectations matter:** If your child expects a playmate and gets a crying blob, disappointment breeds resentment. If they expect a crying blob and feel like a needed helper, they feel important.

### Planning for During Birth

Decide and discuss with your older child who will be with them during the birth itself. This can be a difficult time for the older sibling.

**Critical preparation:** Ensure the child has the opportunity during a "trial run" to spend bonding time with whoever will care for them. Don't wait until labor starts for them to meet their temporary caregiver.

### Consider Birth Attendance

Having your older child present at the birth is an option to consider.

**One parent's experience:** Her 4-year-old son came to the hospital, built a new Lego during labor, and was present for the birth (up near mom's head, holding her hand). He loved being present when his baby sister was born and has always been very protective of her.

**Prerequisites for birth attendance:**
- Expect an easy delivery
- Arrange for a close family friend to be with you during labor
- Have a plan to whisk them away if the birth gets complicated or they get bored
- Prepare them by reading lots of birth books
- Watch birth videos appropriate for children - "Gentle Birth Choices" or "Birth Day" are recommended
- Use their reaction to videos as an indicator of whether they're ready for the actual birth

### Preparing for What Birth Looks Like

**A classic preparation technique:** Let your child help you push a large piece of furniture across the room. Point out that making loud noises, straining, and sweating helps you work harder, and that labor is even more work.

**What they need to know:**
- The baby might look odd at first
- The cord bleeds when it's cut, but that doesn't hurt the baby

## After the Birth

### First Meeting

If your child is not present at the birth, have them visit you as quickly as possible after the baby is born, before other visitors.

**How to handle the first meeting:**
- Emphasize your joy at seeing your older child, rather than your preoccupation with the new baby
- Let them sit and hold the baby
- Help them support the baby's head

**The science behind holding:** Dr. Lawrence Aber, a bonding expert, says that babies' heads give off pheromones. When we inhale them, we fall in love and begin to feel protective. The more your older child snuggles their new sibling, the better their relationship is likely to be. Physical closeness creates emotional bonding.

### Managing Gifts and Celebrations

Privately ask visitors and family to give "big brother or sister" presents instead of "new baby" presents.

**Why this helps:** It helps your oldest feel like there's indeed something to celebrate about this change, not just a loss of attention.

**Additional gift strategy:** Make sure there's a special gift from the new baby to the older sibling. This establishes the relationship as one where the baby gives, not just takes.

## Key Warnings and Anti-Patterns

**Don't dismiss jealousy:** It's natural and needs expression, not suppression.

**Don't time major changes with the birth:** Room transitions, weaning, and potty training should happen well in advance so they don't feel like displacement.

**Don't focus only on the baby at first meeting:** The older child needs to feel they are still your priority, even in the hospital.

**Don't skip realistic preparation:** Children who expect a playmate immediately will be disappointed. Prepare them for a baby who cries, needs lots of care, and won't play for a long time.

**Don't let visitors shower only the baby with attention:** Coordinate with family to ensure the older child feels celebrated too.

## Underlying Psychology

The entire approach rests on several interconnected principles:

1. **Security enables generosity:** A child who feels secure in parental love can afford to share that love with a sibling. An insecure child clings and competes.

2. **Ownership creates protection:** When children feel the baby is "theirs," they become protective rather than jealous.

3. **Physical bonding is chemical:** Pheromones from baby heads create attachment. Maximize older sibling snuggle time.

4. **Identity beyond role:** Children need to know they matter as individuals, not just as "the baby" or "big sibling."

5. **Anticipation reduces threat:** What children understand and prepare for feels less threatening than surprises.

6. **Empathy validates, which soothes:** Acknowledging difficult feelings helps children process them. Dismissing feelings intensifies them.
