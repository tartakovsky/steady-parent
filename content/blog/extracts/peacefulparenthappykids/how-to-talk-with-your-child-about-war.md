## Core Principle: Safety and Reassurance Come First

The fundamental goal when discussing war or violent world events with children is not to educate them about geopolitics, but to ensure they feel safe and to reduce their anxiety. Children take their emotional cues from parents, so a parent's own regulation directly affects how secure the child feels. Even when discussing something as serious as war, the conversation should leave the child feeling more secure, not more frightened.

**Why this matters**: Children may be hearing about war from various sources (friends, overheard conversations, media exposure) and drawing their own conclusions. Without parental guidance, these conclusions often amplify fear. The parent's role is to be a correcting, calming presence that acknowledges reality while reinforcing the child's sense of safety.

## General Guidelines (Apply to All Ages)

### 1. Turn Off the News

Do not expose children of any age to screen images and reporting about war. Parents can check in on news periodically themselves, but the constant news cycle should not be playing in the home.

**Why**: Fear should not set the tone in your home, even when there is a war. Visual images of violence and destruction are particularly impactful and can create lasting anxiety in children. The intensity of news media is calibrated for adult emotional processing, not children's.

### 2. Regulate Yourself Before Speaking to Your Child

Watch your own tendency to react strongly in front of your child. Calm yourself before initiating or responding to conversations about war.

**Why**: Children take their cues from parents. Parental overreactions make children feel less safe. If a parent appears frightened or overwhelmed, the child concludes there is something to be frightened about. A calm parent signals that the situation, while serious, is manageable and does not threaten the child's immediate world.

### 3. Ask Before Telling

When your child asks a question about war, always first ask them what they have already heard about the issue. Do not launch into an explanation.

**Why this order matters**: This approach serves two purposes. First, it allows you to correct misinformation that may be driving unnecessary fear. Second, it reveals the child's actual concerns so you can address them specifically rather than introducing new worries they had not considered. A child asking "Is there a war?" may actually be worried about something very specific (like bombs coming to their neighborhood) that needs direct reassurance.

**Key reframe**: Even more than giving your child information, you want to listen to their worries and reassure them. The conversation is primarily about emotional reassurance, secondarily about factual information. This applies to kids of all ages, even into the teen years. Older children's sophistication can mask anxiety, so the "ask first" approach remains crucial.

### 4. Empower Your Child Through Action

When children see unfairness and pain in the world, it can make them feel despairing and cynical. Always talk about the people who are helping and working to make things better. Then ask your child what they can do to help.

**Why this works**: Feeling that we have any ability at all to help is an antidote to the powerlessness that we otherwise feel in the face of tragedy. The action does not need to be large or impactful in the grand scheme; what matters is the child's sense of agency.

**Age-appropriate actions**:
- Young children who don't have much understanding of money may want to draw a picture, say a prayer, or send love
- Older kids and teens might want to donate some of their saved allowance or raise money to donate to relief organizations

## Age-Specific Approaches

### Preschoolers (Under 5)

**Exposure level**: Kids this young should not be exposed to the news. However, they may overhear things or hear from friends.

**When to engage**: Only if the child raises the issue. Do not proactively introduce the topic.

**Approach sequence**:
1. Ask what they've heard
2. Accept any fears they express: "It could be scary to hear that"
3. Reassure them that this is happening very far away and they are safe
4. Explain at their level: "Sometimes even grownups forget to use their words and that can lead to fighting, which hurts people and is always sad"
5. Offer an empowering action: Ask if they would like to draw a picture and send love to the affected people

**Why this framing works for preschoolers**: Young children understand the concept of "forgetting to use your words" from their own experience. This connects the abstract concept of war to something they already know while also reinforcing the values you're teaching them about conflict resolution.

### School-Age Kids (6-9)

**Exposure level**: Do not proactively raise the issue, but be alert if your child raises it.

**Approach sequence**:
1. Ask what they've heard and what they think about it
2. Ask if they've been wondering anything about what is happening and why
3. Listen to their fears without dismissing them
4. Reassure your child that you will keep them safe

**Example of acknowledging without dismissing**: "Bombs here in California? That IS a scary idea. Thank goodness, that is not going to happen. The fighting is far away. And I will always keep you safe no matter what."

**Why this phrasing matters**: Notice the parent validates the fear first ("That IS a scary idea") before providing reassurance. Jumping straight to "that won't happen" can make the child feel their fear was silly or wrong. The sequence is: validate the emotion -> provide factual reassurance -> affirm your protective role.

**Simple explanations for this age group** (using the Ukraine war as an example):
- Ukraine has been an independent country since World War II. There have been ongoing arguments about who should control parts of the region
- The leader of Russia initiated a military invasion
- The people of Russia do not necessarily agree with the war, and there have been protests against it
- This is happening a long way from here and you are safe
- This is a good example of why it is so important to use our words and work things out when we get mad. Physical fighting hurts people and does not solve anything

**Why include that citizens may disagree with their government**: This prevents the child from developing a simplistic "all people from X country are bad" worldview. It introduces the important concept that leaders and citizens are not the same, and that people everywhere generally want peace.

### Preteens (10-12)

**Key difference from younger children**: Kids aged ten and up will be very interested in what's happening, so don't hesitate to discuss it with them. However, their sophistication can mask anxiety. They may appear to be handling information well while actually feeling scared.

**Approach sequence**:
1. Always start by asking what they've heard, what they think about it, and what they've been wondering about
2. Acknowledge their fears without dismissing them
3. Acknowledge that the situation is tragic
4. Consider together what your family can do to help

**Example of acknowledging sophisticated fears**: "Your friend said there could be nuclear war? That's a very frightening thought. I don't think that will happen, but I understand why the idea would scare you. Sweetheart, thanks for telling me that you were worrying about this. I will keep you safe."

**Why thank them for sharing**: This reinforces that coming to you with worries is the right thing to do. It keeps communication channels open for future concerns.

**Discussion questions that connect to the child's life**:
- "Do you think this is anything like the conflicts that kids you know have with each other?"
- "Do you think it should be a crime to invade another country?"
- "What do you think you would do if you were a Russian and disagreed with the war? What is the best way as a citizen to express your objections to policy decisions?"

**Why these questions work**: They move the child from passive consumption of scary news to active moral reasoning. The first question helps them see parallels to their own experience. The second and third questions develop their understanding of justice, citizenship, and how individuals can respond to institutional wrongdoing.

### Teens

**Opportunity framing**: Take the opportunity to have discussions that help your teen understand how such events can start and escalate, and how ordinary people are affected.

**Discussion questions for deeper exploration**:
- "Why do you think that the rest of the world is using sanctions instead of a military answer? Do you think the sanctions will work? Why or why not?"
- "Do you think that the 'super powers' have a right to decide what happens in the countries close to them? If Mexico allied with Russia, do you think the United States would be gracious about that?"
- "Do you think the US has ever invaded another country? What do you know about those situations? Were they 'justified'?"
- "Would it be better just to allow the aggressor to conquer rather than continuing to support the resistance, if that just lengthens the conflict?"
- "Ordinary people are trying to help other people during this crisis by delivering food and medical supplies. Do you think we could do more to help others in our own life here at home?"

**Why these questions are valuable for teens**: They introduce moral complexity and prevent black-and-white thinking. They also invite the teen to examine their own country's history and actions, developing critical thinking skills. The final question pivots from feeling helpless about distant events to recognizing opportunities for positive action in their immediate environment.

**Information sourcing**: After discussion, suggest checking out good sources of information together. Looking at reliable news sources as a shared activity keeps you involved in how they're processing information.

**Empowerment for teens**: Teens are in the process of shaping their worldviews, so it's important that they have an opportunity to feel they can contribute positively in the face of catastrophic world events. Talk about how even small actions can make a difference. Consider working together to raise money for relief efforts, making it a collaborative family action rather than just assigning the teen a task.

## Key Frameworks and Principles

### The Ask-Listen-Reassure Sequence

This three-step pattern appears throughout the guidance:
1. **Ask** what they've heard/been thinking
2. **Listen** to fears without dismissing them
3. **Reassure** about safety while validating emotions

This sequence works because it prioritizes understanding the child's actual concerns before responding. It prevents the common mistake of either overwhelming children with information they didn't need or missing their real worry entirely.

### Validation Before Reassurance

A recurring pattern: always validate the emotion or concern before providing factual reassurance or correction.

**Wrong approach**: "There won't be bombs here, don't worry"
**Right approach**: "That IS a scary idea. Thank goodness, that is not going to happen."

The validation step communicates that the child's feelings make sense and are not being judged. Only after this emotional acknowledgment does factual reassurance land effectively.

### Connect Abstract Events to Concrete Values

For younger children especially, connect the abstract horror of war to values and concepts they already understand:
- "Grownups forgot to use their words" (connects to conflict resolution skills being taught at home)
- "Physical fighting hurts people and does not solve anything" (reinforces what they're learning about their own behavior)

This makes the incomprehensible slightly more comprehensible while also reinforcing positive values.

### The Empowerment Principle

Powerlessness breeds despair and cynicism. Action, even small action, restores a sense of agency. Every age-appropriate discussion should include:
1. Acknowledgment of the helpers (people making things better)
2. An invitation for the child to take their own action

The action does not need to be effective in terms of actually helping the war effort. Its function is psychological: restoring the child's sense of agency in a world that can feel overwhelming.
