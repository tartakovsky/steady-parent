## Core Framework: Four Stages of Influence on Adopted Children

Dr. Laura Markham outlines a framework for understanding how adoption affects a child's development by examining four sequential stages, each building on the previous one. The effects are cumulative - what happens at each stage shapes the child's capacity to handle the next stage.

### Stage 1: Genetic Foundation

Genes provided by birth parents establish tendencies that are then actualized by the environment. This is not deterministic - **genes interact with and are modified by the environment**, both in utero and throughout life. However, genetic tendencies create a baseline that subsequent experiences will either amplify or moderate.

The key insight here is that genes are not "written in stone" but they do produce inclinations. A child may have genetic tendencies toward certain temperaments or sensitivities that then interact with everything that follows.

### Stage 2: In Utero Environment

**The developing baby is profoundly affected by the in-utero environment.** This happens through several mechanisms:

**Stress hormone transmission:** If the birth mother was under stress, the baby would have been flooded with stress hormones during development. Research shows that catecholamines (stress hormones) cross the placenta. When catecholamines taken from frightened animals are injected into other animals, the recipients act frightened. Scientists theorize these chemical stressors cross the placenta and "frighten" the developing nervous system. If this happens often enough, the fetus actually gets used to feeling chronically stressed - becoming wired for anxiety from before birth.

**Emotional transmission and early bonding:** Hormones that cause the mother to feel certain emotions cross the placenta and presumably cause the baby to feel the same emotions. A mother who feels contentment and love while she talks to her fetus will induce those feelings of love in the fetus. When he hears her voice, he will associate it with those same feelings. The baby is born already somewhat bonded to the mother through this mechanism.

The inverse is also true: A baby may associate anxious feelings with the voices heard in utero, which could mean that after birth he will feel anxious while around those voices, less likely to have warm fuzzy feelings toward those voices or to be comforted by them.

**Voice recognition and familiarity:** During the third trimester, babies distinguish the familiar voices of family members. After birth, those voices soothe them more quickly than strangers' voices. This familiarity is the beginning of bonding.

**Key implication for adoption:** By the time a baby is born, he has already NOT bonded with the mother who will raise him. Whether he had bonded with his birth mother depends on the circumstances, but we must assume he was oriented toward her, familiar with her, looking to bond with her. The adoptive family starts at a deficit.

**Resistance to this research:** Dr. Markham notes the "resistance of the old guard" to these emerging theories about prenatal bonding, with a widespread assumption that this is not real science, that embryos can't possibly have real feelings. She draws a parallel: this is what we thought about babies not so long ago - we even routinely did minor surgery without painkillers because we thought newborns didn't feel pain. The pattern of underestimating infant and fetal experience has been consistently wrong.

### Stage 3: First Month of Life

**Babies begin drawing conclusions about the world as soon as they enter it.** Several factors during this period shape their development:

**Caregiver responsiveness:** Critical questions include: Did the caregiver hold the baby fairly constantly (as babies need) or leave him to cry? When he looked at her, did she meet his gaze or look away? When he was upset, did she soothe him?

**The challenge of the transitional period:** A mother who knows she is giving the baby up might not really try to learn to read the baby's unique cues. A newborn who isn't "connecting" with his caretaker could feel not only like his needs weren't being met, but also possibly that he was in danger - because a baby without an adult committed to his welfare IS in real danger. The baby might become extremely anxious or have "shut down."

**Temperament development:** If a baby had a difficult temperament (either by virtue of genetics or embryonic shaping), he might have been difficult to care for. A child who is being given up for adoption would not have been likely to receive the care that would make him into an "easy" baby. Wolke and St James-Robert (1987, in "Psychobiology and Early Development," Oxford) claim that difficult temperament is a product of parent behavior and perceptions. While Dr. Markham wouldn't go that far, suboptimal care during this period makes challenging temperament more likely.

**Developmental lag in adopted babies:** Babies adopted after a month or more are often lagging in development. Dr. Markham shares an anecdote from a close friend who adopted her son at six months: "It was like he was waiting for someone to come along and pay attention to him before he could really start living. Once he had me, his development took off." This illustrates how babies need committed attention to develop normally.

**Fundamental social nature of newborns:** Ruth P. Newton states: "Newborns are social creatures who arrive prepared to interact." This means even very young babies are actively seeking connection, not passive recipients of care.

**Research gap:** There is no research specifically about the relationship between women and their babies when the woman knows she is giving the baby up. However, the effect might be similar to women who can't relate in an attuned way to their babies due to post-partum depression - and there IS substantial research on that topic.

### Stage 4: Post-Adoption Period

**Even without a healthy connection, the baby has begun to adapt.** Key principles:

**Prior adaptation matters:** Even if the baby wasn't experiencing a healthy connection with his caregiver prior to adoption, he had begun to adapt to that person and environment. He had begun to draw conclusions about the world and shape his behavior accordingly. His brain was already taking shape based on his early environment. So even without "secure" attachment in the sense of feeling his emotional needs would be met, he was certainly bonded in the sense that this person was feeding him, changing him, dressing him, holding him. The baby was bonded, for better or worse.

**The double challenge for adoptive families:** When a baby with a potentially high-needs temperament enters a family where there is already another baby not much older, both children would be quite needy. Any parents would be challenged to meet the needs of both little ones, given that the new arrival was already a month old and possibly high-needs, and that they had to begin from scratch to bond with him. Becoming attuned to this baby would have been much harder than if he had come to them as a newborn.

**Recovery is possible but requires motivation:** Attuned parenting should be able to make up for a month's delay in the start of the relationship. Not easy, but certainly doable. Parents who chose to take this baby into their arms and home should have been motivated enough to meet his needs, even if considerable.

**Attachment measurement timeline:** We measure the health of the attachment relationship at one year, so we usually think of it developing during that full year, although we don't really know whether babies draw their conclusions much earlier. A baby who arrives in a family at one month old is still quite open to connecting with his parents. It's the parents' job to attune to him, to make sure he concludes they're reliably there to protect him and help him.

## The Mourning Question: Can Babies Grieve?

**The central complication:** Could it be that the baby is NOT open to connecting with new parents because he is mourning his birth mother, with whom he had already bonded? Dr. Markham considers this entirely possible. The baby might have a hard time trusting the new parents.

**The survival imperative:** Sooner or later, the imperative to live would take over. The baby would move beyond mourning, would "forget" about the loss, would bond with the new family.

**But the grief remains buried:** Somewhere inside him is the very early experience of tremendous grief, along with the panic of abandonment. Would this show up? Maybe not, if his adoptive parents are attuned enough. But throughout his life, there would always be a fragility. Later experiences of loss might give rise to depression or anxiety.

## Case Study: The Man Who Didn't Know He Was Adopted

Dr. Markham describes a man who was adopted but did not find out until after his parents' deaths when he was 50. He was shocked, said it had never occurred to him. But throughout his life, his reaction whenever a sweetheart broke up with him was to be plunged into depression. He had to check himself into a hospital with panic attacks after a serious breakup.

**What this example demonstrates:** This is an extreme reaction, and once he learned he was adopted, he was able to understand that this panic reaction when a woman left him was related to his adoption - even though he had not known about the adoption and had been adopted during his first month of life.

**The implication:** The effect of early separation exists even when the person has no conscious knowledge of it. The body and psyche remember what the mind does not.

## The Research Challenge

**Why this research is hard to conduct:**

1. You would need to separate kids who knew they were adopted from kids who were never told, because the "proof" of some effect would be kids who didn't even know they were adopted but showed some effect from it
2. Then you would have to eliminate other causes that might be affecting the adoptee, because maybe something else happened in their background to cause the observed issues
3. The variables are too entangled to isolate cleanly

**Historical research foundation:** John Bowlby studied babies and children who were orphaned or separated from parents during World War 2 in England. These studies gave rise to the entire field of **Attachment Theory**. He wrote his "Attachment and Loss" trilogy from this experience. His key finding: children and even babies who are separated from parents go through stages of mourning that leave them wounded and vulnerable, even once the parents return.

**Michael Rutter's finding on compounding loss:** Rutter, Bowlby's associate, found that people who experienced a loss in childhood were more vulnerable to any losses that happened later in life. Early loss creates a lasting sensitivity to subsequent losses.

**Limitation of this historical research:** There probably weren't many one-month-olds in Bowlby's orphanage, so we're extrapolating from older babies to very young infants.

## Common Misconception Refuted

**The false belief:** Many people will tell you that babies who are a few weeks old don't have a preference for their parents over strangers.

**The reality:** Simply not true. Very young babies are willing to let a stranger hold them, but that doesn't mean they don't know the difference, or that they would not grieve if the stranger took them home. Acceptance of being held is not the same as absence of preference or attachment.

## Outcomes and Resilience

**Adoption does not doom anyone to poor adjustment.** Yes, adopted children grieve a great loss, and it can be tough for them to resist the conclusion that somehow there must be something wrong with them for their birth parents to have relinquished them.

**What helps children overcome challenges:** Children overcome all kinds of challenges - from illness to poverty to the death of a parent. What helps them through hard times is having at least one adult who is completely committed to their well-being.

**The four elements of resilience:**
1. The child feels heard and understood
2. The child has a trusted adult to help him manage the big, scary feelings that overwhelm him
3. The child feels that he is at the center of someone's world
4. With these in place, the child can process his challenge and emerge stronger

## Key Takeaways for Understanding Adoption Effects

1. **Effects begin before birth** - through genetic inheritance, stress hormone exposure, and prenatal bonding (or lack thereof) with the birth mother

2. **Babies are active participants** - they arrive prepared to interact socially and immediately begin drawing conclusions about the world

3. **The first month matters significantly** - but recovery is possible with attuned parenting

4. **Grief can be unconscious but still operative** - early losses affect people even when they have no conscious memory of the loss

5. **Fragility may persist even with good outcomes** - a person can be well-adjusted overall but have particular vulnerability to experiences that echo the original loss

6. **Committed caregiving is the healing factor** - what matters most is having at least one adult completely committed to the child's well-being who helps them feel heard, understood, and central to someone's world
