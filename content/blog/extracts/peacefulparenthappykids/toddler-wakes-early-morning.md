# Early Morning Waking in Toddlers: Causes and Solutions

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids
Context: A 19-month-old who previously slept well (7:30pm to 8am) began waking at 5:30-6am after her mother started a new job. She also stopped napping well on weekends.

## Core Problem: The Cortisol-Sleep Cycle

### Understanding Normal Sleep Needs
Most babies around 19 months need **10-12 hours of sleep per night**. A child who was previously sleeping over 12 hours nightly and doing well on that schedule likely needs the full 12 hours, not just 10. Parents can usually tell when their child isn't getting enough sleep, and that intuition should be trusted.

### The Over-Tiredness Paradox
The central mechanism behind early waking is counterintuitive: **children wake up early because they are over-tired, not because they've had enough sleep**.

Here's how the cycle works:
1. When toddlers miss naps or experience stress, their bodies go on alert
2. This alert state triggers the release of **stress hormones like cortisol**
3. Cortisol makes children cranky and hyper-alert, which paradoxically makes it harder to fall asleep
4. The elevated tension persists through the night
5. During normal sleep cycles, all humans experience slight awakenings as they transition between phases
6. Well-rested children put themselves back to sleep during these transitions; over-tired children pop fully awake instead
7. This same mechanism causes them to awaken earlier in the morning than they should

This explains why a child who hasn't napped all day and seems exhausted still resists going to sleep at 8pm - and then wakes up at 5:30am after only 10 hours. The cortisol is working against the sleep the child desperately needs.

## Primary Solution: Earlier Bedtime

**Move bedtime earlier to 7pm** rather than later. This defies logic but works because:
- If the child genuinely needs more sleep (which the early waking suggests), an earlier bedtime helps them catch up
- The cortisol cycle can be broken within a couple of days once the child is no longer sleep-deprived
- Pushing bedtime later (like trying 8pm) actually worsens the problem because it extends the over-tired state

## Addressing the Emotional Root Cause

### Separation Stress
When a sleep regression coincides with a major life change like a parent returning to work, the child may:
- Miss the parent and want more time with them
- Feel anxious about the parent's absence
- Be too worried to sleep deeply

### The Importance of Crying It Out Safely (Not Traditional CIO)
Many babies around 19 months start to resist sleep. The recommended approach:
1. Stay with the child and insist it is time to sleep
2. The child will likely begin crying
3. This crying represents **tears and fears she's been storing up** during time away from you
4. Keep reassuring her that you are her mother and will always come back
5. The child will eventually cry a great deal and then fall asleep
6. After this emotional release, falling asleep should become easier again

**Key distinction**: This is not "cry it out" where you leave the room. You stay present, providing safety and reassurance while allowing the emotional release to happen.

### Maximizing Connection Time
Shower the child with attention during whatever waking time you do have together. This helps address the underlying anxiety about separation.

## Environmental and Physiological Factors

### Daycare and Cortisol
Children in daycare often have **elevated cortisol levels in the afternoon**. If possible, consider alternatives that keep the child in their own home during afternoon hours. However, being with a grandparent (as in this case) is different from daycare and shouldn't cause the same cortisol elevation.

### TV and Melatonin Production
Television **suppresses melatonin production**, making it harder for children to:
- Fall asleep at bedtime
- Stay asleep through the night

Eliminating TV can help restore natural melatonin levels.

### Light Exposure
A bright room will lure anyone to wakefulness. **Blackout curtains** trick the body into sleeping longer by maintaining darkness.

### Teething
For children around this age, teething can disrupt sleep. If daytime behavior suggests teething pain, trying Tylenol or other teething remedies may help determine if this is a contributing factor.

## Teaching Self-Regulation for Morning Sleep

### The Alarm Clock Method
This approach helps children learn to stay asleep longer through positive conditioning rather than cry-it-out (which doesn't work in the morning anyway because the child is too rested).

**Setup and Process:**
1. Get a CD alarm clock and load it with the child's favorite music
2. Start by setting it for the current wake time (e.g., 6am)
3. Tell the child: "You need to sleep all night. In the morning, the clock will play your music and I will come get you"
4. If she wakes before the alarm, go in, hug her, and say: "It is still night. You have to wait until the music comes on, then I will get you"
5. When the alarm plays, get her up immediately

**Progressive Adjustment:**
- Once she routinely sleeps until 6am, increase the alarm time by 5-minute increments
- Continue until reaching the target time (e.g., 7am)
- If possible, use a clock with a remote so you can turn it off on days she's still asleep

**Why This Works:**
Little ones love the reassurance of a predictable pattern: when the alarm goes off, mom appears. Many children seem to regulate themselves to wake with the alarm rather than before it.

### Visual Cue Alternatives
If you can't find an adjustable remote-controlled alarm:
- **Bunny rabbit alarm clock** with eyes that open at the set time - won't wake her if she's asleep, but gives her something to check
- **Plug-in timer with a nightlight** set to turn on at the target time - a less expensive option that provides the same visual cue

## The Nap-Night Sleep Connection

Making sure the child naps prevents the over-tiredness that causes night problems. Important nuances:

### Different Rules for Different People
Children can learn that rules differ depending on who they're with. The grandfather napping on the couch with her isn't inherently problematic. The child can understand that with Grandpa, naps happen on the couch, while different arrangements exist at other times.

### Weekend Nap Solutions
If the child won't nap in the crib on weekends (because she's used to the couch), **schedule errands so she naps in the car**. Getting the nap is more important than where it happens during this adjustment period.

## Short-Term Coping Strategies

### Co-Sleeping as the Easiest Solution
When the child wakes at 5:30 or 6am, **take her into your bed** (or go to the couch or a mattress on the floor with her if you don't want her getting used to your bed).

**Why this is recommended:**
- Early waking is the hardest sleep problem to solve
- Children are somewhat rested by early morning
- They usually work themselves into a frenzy when kept awake
- Once in a frenzy, they can't fall asleep
- If napping with her gets everyone an extra hour of sleep, that might be the best achievable outcome for now
- A tired child who is actually sleep-deprived will probably go back to sleep with you for another hour

### Food Timing
**Don't feed her until your target wake-up time** (e.g., 7am). If her body becomes accustomed to eating at 5:30am, it will wake earlier looking for breakfast. Keeping the first meal at a consistent, reasonable time helps prevent the body from anticipating food too early.

## Melatonin: Limited and Careful Use

Melatonin can help break the cortisol cycle, but comes with important caveats:
- **Never use for longer than a night or two** with a baby
- We lack research on long-term effects on babies, and their systems are sensitive
- No known side effects
- Start with a very small dose
- Consult the pediatrician before trying
- Purpose is to get past the cortisol build-up and help catch up on sleep, not as an ongoing solution

---

## Perspective and Reassurance

### This Is Temporary
The sleep regression is almost certainly a temporary reaction to:
- Missing the parent who returned to work
- The grandfather's different napping arrangements

In other words, it's a tough transition, but it won't last.

### Avoid Adding Stress
Treating the situation as an emergency creates additional stress that compounds the problem. Stay patient, give lots of love, and help the child settle into her new routine. She needs the sleep, and she will adjust.
