# Critique of the Love and Logic Parenting Approach

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids (Dr. Laura Markham)

## Historical Context of the Consequences-Based Movement

**Love and Logic** emerged in the first wave of anti-punishment parenting books over twenty years ago. The core premise was that instead of punishing children (which backfires), parents should use **logical consequences**. **Jane Nelsen's Positive Discipline** approach initially shared this recommendation.

The theoretical appeal makes sense: consequences feel more natural and educational than arbitrary punishments. However, the practical reality is different. In practice, using consequences often ends up looking like punishment to the child. This is the fundamental problem that undermines the approach.

Jane Nelsen has evolved her thinking over time. She no longer recommends using consequences because of this problem, having recognized through her own experience and development of the Positive Discipline approach that consequences often function as punishment in disguise.

Love and Logic, by contrast, has not made this evolution. They continue to use consequences in ways that function as punishment.

## The Core Problem: Consequences as Punishment in Disguise

The fundamental critique is that **consequences delivered as "teaching tools" are experienced by children as punishment**. Even when parents are instructed to be empathic while giving consequences, the underlying dynamic remains punitive.

This approach amounts to saying: "I love you, too bad I have to punish you, I know that makes you mad but you brought it on yourself." The framing shifts blame to the child while the parent inflicts the painful consequence. The empathy is performative rather than genuine because genuine empathy would not involve deliberately making a child suffer.

### Illustrative Example: The Stair Climbing Consequence

The Love and Logic book gives an example where a child is rude to his mother. She sends him to his room. He refuses to go. Instead of spanking, the consequence is that he cannot have dinner until he walks up the stairs to his room and back to the dinner table twenty times.

**What this example reveals:**
- The "consequence" has no logical connection to the original behavior (rudeness)
- Walking stairs 20 times is an arbitrary, punitive demand
- Withholding food is a coercive measure
- The power struggle is still occurring, just without physical violence
- The underlying emotional issue (why was the child rude?) is completely ignored

**Partial credit:** The mother did not lose her temper, hit, or yell. The authors do emphasize that parents should be empathic while giving consequences. These are improvements over harsher approaches. But they do not make the approach effective or truly respectful.

## Missing Component: Parental Emotional Regulation

The Love and Logic book does not pay attention to how parents can actually manage their own emotions. This is a critical gap because most parents who try these techniques still seem very angry to their children, even when following the prescribed steps.

Without genuine emotional regulation on the parent's part:
- The "empathy" comes across as hollow or sarcastic
- Children sense the underlying anger or frustration
- Power struggles still develop because the parent is emotionally triggered
- The relational damage from parental anger still occurs, just without overt yelling

The techniques fail not because parents are doing them wrong, but because the techniques do not address the real issue: the parent's emotional state.

## Missing Component: Curiosity About the Child's Experience

The Love and Logic approach takes the perspective that all kids will get away with whatever they can. Not because they are bad, but simply because they are kids. This framing assumes children are naturally inclined to push limits and misbehave unless controlled by external consequences.

**The critique:** The authors do not evidence any curiosity about WHY kids do what they do. This is a fundamental failure because understanding the why is essential to addressing problems at the root cause.

### Why Understanding Matters

If a child is rude to their parent, there is always a reason. The child is hurting about something. You can send him to his room or make him walk stairs twenty times, but you will not:
- Discover what is actually bothering him
- Address the underlying emotional need
- Prevent the behavior from recurring
- Build the relationship through understanding

**Alternative framing:** If a child raised with emotional intelligence were rude to a parent (which would be rare), the parent's response should be curiosity: What made this child feel so bad that they would be willing to hurt my feelings? This question leads to connection and problem-solving rather than punishment and resentment.

## The Gap: Emotional Intelligence Development

Love and Logic does not support parents in helping children develop emotional intelligence or learn to manage their own emotions. The focus is entirely on "teaching lessons" through "consequences."

**Why this matters:** Research by **John Gottman** indicates that when parents set **empathic limits**, children learn emotional intelligence. The key is empathic limits, not consequences. Consequences, by contrast, function as punishment, and there is extensive research showing that punishment backfires. (For a comprehensive list of studies demonstrating this, see **Alfie Kohn's book Unconditional Parenting**.)

Children who receive consequences learn:
- External control (behave to avoid punishment)
- Resentment toward the person imposing consequences
- Hiding behavior to avoid detection

Children who receive empathic limits learn:
- Internal motivation (behave because it feels right)
- Emotional vocabulary and regulation skills
- Problem-solving through relationship

## The Natural Consequences Approach: Limitations

One idea from Love and Logic that has merit is helping children become responsible for themselves instead of nagging them. The specific method proposed is to stop telling the child what to do and let them suffer natural consequences.

### Example: Bedtime Without Rules

In the Love and Logic example, parents do not fight about bedtime. They let children (at least six years old) stay up as late as they want and then feel miserably tired the next day at school. The theory is that experiencing tiredness teaches the child to go to bed earlier.

**Practical problems with this approach:**

1. **Children find an unsatisfactory middle ground:** In practice, kids often settle on a compromise like midnight, which is late enough to cause chronic tiredness but not dramatic enough to trigger a self-correction. The result is a child who is never well-rested and never in a good mood.

2. **Abdication of parental responsibility:** Letting a six-year-old set their own bedtime is not exercising appropriate parental responsibility. Children at that age do not have the executive function to make good decisions about sleep.

3. **Safety and supervision concerns:** A child awake after parents are asleep can get into all kinds of trouble, including on the computer. The natural consequences approach ignores the need for age-appropriate supervision.

**The alternative:** There is a way to patiently help children learn habits and skills:
- Without nagging
- Without punishment
- Without abandoning them to consequences they are not developmentally ready to handle

This requires more parental engagement and guidance, not less.

## Summary: What Love and Logic Gets Right and Wrong

**Positive elements:**
- Rejection of spanking and yelling
- Emphasis on calm delivery
- Instruction to be empathic (even if implementation falls short)
- Goal of helping children become responsible

**Fundamental problems:**
- Consequences function as punishment in practice
- No guidance on parental emotional regulation
- No curiosity about why children behave as they do
- Does not address root causes of behavior
- Does not develop emotional intelligence in children
- Natural consequences approach can mean abandoning children to choices they are not ready to make
- Power struggles still occur without tools to prevent them

**The bottom line:** This approach is better than spanking or yelling, but it will not raise children who understand and can manage their emotions. The consequences approach is simply punishment delivered calmly, and punishment has been shown repeatedly to backfire.
