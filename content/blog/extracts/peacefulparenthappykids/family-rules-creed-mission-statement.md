# The Kind of Home You Want: Your Family Rules, Motto & Mission Statement

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids (Dr. Laura Markham)

## Core Philosophy: Agreements Over Rules

**The healthiest and happiest families do not have a lot of rules.** Instead, they have simple, clear expectations for the way people treat each other that both adults and children try to follow. The adults model these behaviors, and when children struggle to follow them, the adults help them.

### Family Rules as a Compass, Not a Weapon

Family rules should function as a compass you return to together, not as a way to prove someone was wrong. When a child breaks a rule, there is always a reason (perhaps a sibling was unkind first, or unintentionally inconsiderate). Use these moments as opportunities to help children solve their problems, with your family values as the north star to move toward.

### Child Ownership Is Essential

It is important for children to emotionally "own" your family rules. Involve them in deciding on the most important guidelines. When kids help write the agreements, they are far more likely to feel proud of them and want to live up to them.

## How to Create Effective Family Agreements

### Keep It Limited

Keep your Family Agreements to no more than five so they do not feel overwhelming to children.

### Start With Values

In deciding on your top rules, keep them global and always begin with your values. If treating each other with compassion and kindness comes first, then the number one rule is "Be Kind."

### Phrase Positively

Phrasing in the positive is more effective than stating what you do not want.

**Effective:** "We ask before we touch someone's body."
**Less Effective:** "No hitting."

## Sample Family Agreements

**1. We are kind.**
(No hurting people or things; No mean words except in the privacy of your bedroom.)

**2. We are respectful.**
(We ask before touching someone's body or possessions.)

**3. We tell each other the truth and always keep our promises.**

**4. We clean up our own messes and when we make mistakes, we repair them.**
(We always work things out with each other. We all pitch in to help as a family.)

**5. We support and uplift each other.**

## Family Motto: A Guiding Vision

A Family Motto is a one-phrase rule so important that it becomes a guiding vision for your family. You will find yourself using it often, and it becomes a saying in your family.

### Example Family Mottos

- Choose love.
- In this house, we do loving and kindness.
- Be brave, be kind, be respectful.
- What will work? Team work!
- People are more important than things.
- Family is forever.
- There is ALWAYS more love.

## Creating a Family Mission Statement

### The Process Is the Product

The process of discussing your mission statement with your family is probably more valuable than the finished product. Whatever works for your family is right; there is no wrong approach.

### Stephen Covey's Method

Ask family members a series of questions, including:
- What makes you want to come home?
- What embarrasses you about our family?

Then have each child write a statement about the kind of family they want to live in. Combine everyone's most important points into one family mission statement.

### Example Mission Statement (Covey Family)

"The mission of our family is to create a nurturing place of faith, order, truth, love, happiness, and relaxation, and to provide opportunity for each individual to become responsibly independent, and effectively interdependent, in order to serve worthy purposes in society."

### Discussion Questions for Your Family

- What are your three favorite one-word descriptions of our family?
- What is most important to our family?
- What do I value most about our family?
- What kind of family do I want to live in?

### The Iterative Process

Have everyone share their answers and start combining. Make your first draft and post it for everyone to read and think about. You do not have to do this all at once. Think about your draft and revise it in a week. Once everyone agrees on a version that feels good, print it out and post it. Have another review periodically to ask: does this need revision? Discuss, revise, shake on it, frame it.

## The Deeper Purpose

### What Children Will Remember

One day, your children will not remember every rule you tried to enforce, but they will remember what it felt like to live in your home. They will remember:
- Whether kindness was real
- Whether respect was mutual
- Whether mistakes were met with repair
- Whether love was always bigger than conflict

### Family Agreements as a Shared Promise

Your Family Agreements are simply a shared promise: "This is how we try to treat each other here."

### When Someone Falls Short

When someone falls short (because everyone will), that is not failure. It is the moment you get to practice your mission in real life: pausing, repairing, choosing love again, and finding your way back to each other.

### Making It Real

If you keep revisiting your creed together, it becomes more than decor. It becomes the feeling of home.
