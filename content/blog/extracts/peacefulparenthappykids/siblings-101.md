# Helping Siblings Get Along: Core Principles and Practical Strategies

## Understanding the Root Causes of Sibling Conflict

Sibling rivalry stems from multiple sources, not just one. When a younger sibling is born, virtually all children worry that they have lost their parents' love. The reasoning in a child's mind is: "Why else would you have gotten a newer, younger model?" This fear of displacement is universal and drives much of the rivalry parents observe.

Beyond rivalry over parental love, siblings experience conflict from:
- **Personality clashes** between children with different temperaments
- **Age-related conflicts** where different ages mean wanting different things
- **Same-age conflicts** where being close in age means wanting the same things
- **General cohabitation friction** because even loving siblings have bad days, just like any humans living together

Children lack two critical capacities that adults have: the perspective to understand that conflict is not necessarily the other person's fault, and the skills to work out differences peacefully. This means parents must actively teach these skills rather than expecting children to figure them out on their own.

The hopeful framing: children can be friends for life, and parenting choices can both prevent and transform sibling tensions.

## Teaching Conflict Resolution Skills

### Why Children Cannot "Just Use Their Words"

Most adults did not learn good social-emotional or conflict-resolution skills as children, so they do not know how to teach these skills to their own kids. When parents tell children to "use their words," children often face two problems: they do not know what words to use, and when upset, they cannot access reasonable words even if they know them.

This means parents should expect to set limits over and over while providing the specific language children need to express their needs and solve problems without attacking each other. The investment pays off because this is a skill children will use in every relationship for the rest of their lives.

### The Three-Step Process for Teaching Limit-Setting

When one child acts inappropriately toward a sibling, use this sequence:

**Step 1: Acknowledge feelings or wants**
Example: "You wanted your brother to stop pressing your nose, so you pinched him."
This step validates the underlying need before addressing the behavior. The child feels understood rather than simply corrected.

**Step 2: Set the limit**
Example: "No pinching. Pinching hurts."
State the limit clearly and briefly. The explanation is simple: the action causes harm.

**Step 3: Teach the alternative**
Example: "Tell your brother 'Stop touching me!'"
Give the child specific words they can use next time. Do not assume they will generate appropriate language on their own.

When parents consistently use this approach, children begin using this language with each other without parental intervention.

## The Rule Against Taking Sides

### Why Defending One Child Backfires

If you defend one child, the other child becomes convinced you love the sibling more. This does not reduce conflict; it intensifies sibling tensions because now the conflict has higher stakes (parental love) attached to it.

### The Alternative: Coach Both Children

Instead of jumping in to admonish the child who caused a problem, coach the other child to stand up for themselves. This approach teaches both children skills and avoids the appearance of favoritism.

**Practical example of coaching:**

Dad: "Daniel, you look upset. What don't you like? Can you tell your sister?"

Daniel: "Daniel don't like pushing!"

Dad: "Serena, Daniel says he doesn't like being pushed. Will you stop pushing or do you need my help to move away?"

Notice: The parent does not tell Serena she is wrong. The parent helps Daniel express his need, then gives Serena a choice with a clear consequence (parental help to create physical separation).

Back up children's expressed needs with reference to house rules. Example: "We don't touch someone else's body without asking." The rule is stated as a family standard, not as one child being right and the other wrong.

## Self-Regulated Turns Instead of Forced Sharing

### The Family Rule

At home, each child can use a toy she has for as long as she wants it, up to the next meal. Sharing before that point is her choice. She decides when her turn is finished. If she puts the toy down, the other child must ask "Are you done with your turn?" before taking it.

**Important exception:** When at a park or when other children are visiting, warn kids in advance that short turns apply in that situation. The rule is context-dependent.

### What Children Learn from Forced Sharing (Anti-Pattern)

Forced sharing teaches a set of problematic lessons:
- If I cry loud enough, I get what I want, even if someone else has it
- Parents arbitrarily decide who gets what when, and the decision depends on how dramatically I beg for my turn
- My sibling and I are in constant competition. I do not like him.
- I won this time, but I will lose again soon. I had better protest loudly when my turn ends to get every minute I can. If I make my parent miserable, I get more time with the toy.

### What Children Learn from Self-Regulated Turns

Self-regulated turns teach a healthier set of lessons:
- I can ask for what I want. Sometimes I get a turn soon; sometimes I must wait. Everybody gets a turn eventually.
- It is okay to cry, but crying does not mean I get the toy
- I do not get everything I want, but my parent always understands and helps me
- After I cry, I feel better
- I like the feeling when my sibling gives me the toy. I like her.
- When I finish with the toy and give it to my sibling, I feel good inside, generous.

### Handling the Waiting Child's Distress

At first, there will be crying from the child waiting for their turn. View this as an opportunity: the child can express pent-up tears and fears they have been carrying around. The parent's role is to provide loving attention during the wait: "I will help you wait for the toy."

A revealing pattern: once children get a chance to cry with parental support, they often lose interest in the toy afterward. This suggests the upset was not really about the toy to begin with. The toy dispute was a surface expression of deeper emotional needs.

Once families consistently use self-regulated turns, children love the system and stop fighting about sharing.

## Never Compare Children

### Why Negative Comparisons Harm

Example of a negative comparison: "Why do you give me such a hard time about brushing your teeth? See how your sister just opens her mouth?"

Parents may think this motivates the child. What the child actually hears: "My sister is better than me, and mom/dad loves her more." This increases sibling resentment rather than motivating better behavior.

The solution: Set whatever limits you need without reference to siblings. Address the behavior directly without comparison.

### Why Even Positive Comparisons Backfire

Example of a positive comparison: "I wish your brother would just sit down and do his homework with no fuss, like you do!"

What the "good" child learns from this:
- "I'm the good kid so mom loves me"
- "I always need to be a good girl to be loved" (conditional love)
- Investment in the parent continuing to view the sibling as "the bad kid"

Positive comparisons create pressure on the praised child while also poisoning the sibling relationship.

## Validating Emotions

**Validating emotions** means acknowledging how your child is feeling. You do not have to agree with their feeling (for example, that their sibling should never have been born). You do acknowledge the hurt and anger they feel about what their sibling said or did.

An important nuance: you can validate that each child in an argument has a reason to feel hurt and angry, even if one or both have acted badly. Emotions are always valid, even when actions must be limited.

The practical benefit: when you validate, your child is less likely to feel the need to act on their anger. Validation reduces the pressure that drives aggressive behavior.

## Creating an Atmosphere of Kindness and Appreciation

### The Kindness Journal

Keep a journal in which you write down examples of kind acts you notice between your kids, or that they report to you. Read excerpts to your children on Sunday evenings. This serves two purposes:
- Children bask in how good they feel, both as giver and receiver of kindness
- Children get a chance to see each other as a source of love and kindness

### Dinner Appreciations

Every night at dinner, have each person find at least one specific thing to appreciate about each other person.

Examples:
- "I appreciate that Jillian helped me with my homework."
- "I appreciate that Mommy played my game with me."
- "I appreciate that Daddy made my favorite dinner."
- "I appreciate that Danny didn't bother us when my friends came over to play."

The appreciations must be specific, not generic. Specificity requires children to notice and remember kind acts.

## Building Teamwork Between Siblings

### The Cooperation Jar

Set up a Cooperation jar and put a coin in it every time you observe the kids being nice to each other, including playing without fighting. If they express feelings in an appropriate, respectful way, they gain coins. Expressing feelings appropriately gets extra recognition because it is so hard for kids.

The children decide together how to spend the money. This adds a layer of required cooperation and shared reward.

### The Framing

Make children partners in avoiding fights with each other. They are on the same team working toward a shared goal, rather than opponents competing for parental favor.

---

## Ensuring Personal Space

Siblings already have to share parents, toys, family time, and the spotlight. This is a lot of sharing.

### Room Sharing Considerations

Room sharing can foster closeness between siblings, but it can also be too much sharing, especially for children with very different temperaments.

### Solutions for Shared Spaces

Even within shared rooms, children need private space:
- A high cupboard to keep special possessions away from a younger sibling
- A "tent" bed so a child can be alone when they choose
- Paint a line down the middle of the floor and set furniture to define two separate spaces

Some children get along better after their space is clearly delineated, even if they share a room.

## Proactive Intervention Before Fights

### Recognizing Patterns

Many children can play together happily for only limited periods, then need a solitary activity. Other children love constant engagement, and when they get bored, they get irritable and start to pester their sibling.

Parents should notice these tendencies and intervene before fighting occurs. The goal is to protect both the sibling relationship and parental sanity.

### Practical Applications

Keep tired and hungry children away from each other. Avoid situations that create fights.

**Car trips example:**
Separate kids in the car as much as possible. If they must sit in adjacent seats, give them separate music devices with headphones and an incentive reward.

**Sample script for car trips:**
"It can be hard to sit in the car for so long and when you get grumpy it would be easy to take it out on the other people in the car. But let's see if we can do this in a happier way. Can you two be a team? If you two can cooperate and maintain a peaceful atmosphere during our trip, we can have a special treat to eat during the last half hour of the drive."

This script:
- Acknowledges the difficulty
- Names the temptation (taking frustration out on others)
- Reframes siblings as teammates
- Provides concrete positive incentive

## Do Not Give Older Children Responsibility for Younger Ones

Do not make older children "watch" younger siblings or require them to play with them. This creates resentment and unhealthy power dynamics.

If the older child tries to enforce family rules on the younger one, redirect with appreciation: "Thanks, Sweetheart. I'm glad you know the family rules and are so good at following them, but it's the parents' job to be in charge."

This response:
- Validates the older child's knowledge of rules
- Affirms their good behavior
- Clearly reasserts the parental role
- Removes the burden/power from the older child

## Love Each Child Best

### The Core Insight

If your child knows that you could never love anyone else more than you love them, they will not find themselves jealous of their sibling very often. The first focus must be strengthening and sweetening your relationship with each child individually.

### Practical Implementation

- **Special Time:** One-on-one time with each child daily
- **Laughter:** Lots of laughter daily with each child
- **Empathy:** Allow your child to express emotions without judgment
- **Loving guidance instead of punishment:** Approach discipline as teaching rather than punishment

### The Core Message Each Child Must Know

Children need to know deep in their bones: "There is more than enough for you, no matter what your sibling gets. I could never love anyone more than I love you."

### Why This Works

Kids raised with strong individual connection, emotional expression, and loving guidance are happier and emotionally healthier. Emotionally healthy children get along better with their siblings because they are not operating from a place of insecurity or unmet needs.

## Summary of Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Forced sharing** - creates competition mindset and resentment
2. **Taking sides** - convinces the "losing" child that parents love sibling more
3. **Comparing children** - even positive comparisons create conditional love and investment in sibling's failure
4. **Telling children to "use their words" without teaching specific words** - children do not know what to say and cannot access reasonable language when upset
5. **Making older children responsible for younger ones** - creates resentment and inappropriate power dynamics
6. **Ignoring the need for personal space** - too much forced togetherness increases friction
7. **Reacting to fights rather than preventing them** - missing the opportunity to intervene before conflict starts
