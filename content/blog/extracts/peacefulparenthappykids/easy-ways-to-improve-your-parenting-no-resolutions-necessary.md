- Redirection provides acceptable alternatives rather than just stopping behavior
- Positive framing reduces conflict and gives children agency

- Laughter changes body chemistry by decreasing stress hormones
- Results in better cooperation and improved sleep
- Increases bonding hormones, strengthening parent-child relationship

## The Ten Strategies

### 1. Empathize More
**Key insight**: Children don't always need to get their way, but they always need to feel understood

**Practice**:
- Acknowledge the reason behind your child's desires while setting limits
- Replace commands with empathetic redirection
- Example: Instead of "Turn that screen off right now!" try "You really wish you could keep watching, I know. And still, it's time for dinner. Say 'Goodbye Screen.'"

### 2. Tell Them What They CAN Do
**Key insight**: Positive direction is more effective than prohibition

**Practice**:
- Offer alternatives when setting limits
- Example: Instead of "Stop playing with the ball in the house!" try "Balls are for outside. Inside, you can throw the stuffed animals into the bathtub."

### 3. Get Them Laughing Every Day
**Key insight**: Laughter is a biological reset that improves behavior and connection

**Benefits**:
- Decreases stress hormones
- Improves cooperation
- Enhances sleep quality
- Increases bonding hormones

### 4. Say Yes More Often
**Key insight**: Even "no" can be delivered with "yes" energy

**Practice**:
- When you CAN say yes, say it
- Reframe necessary limits with enthusiasm and affirmation
- Example: "YES, it's time to clean up, and YES I will help you and YES we can leave your tower up and YES you can growl about it and YES if we hurry we can read an extra story..."

### 5. Daily One-on-One Special Time
**Key insight**: Children need tangible expressions of love like an essential vitamin

**Practice**:
- Spend dedicated time with each child daily
- Show up and pour love into child without controlling them
- Let the child lead during this time

### 6. Use Your Pause Button to Yell Less
**Key insight**: Parents are emotional regulation role models; children learn by watching

**The Pause Button Method**:
1. Stop
2. Drop (your agenda, just for now)
3. Breathe

**Practice**:
- After pausing, try a "Do-Over"
- Acknowledge frustration, then re-approach with cooperation focus
- Example: "Sorry, I was getting frustrated. Let's try that again. I need you to work with me here."

### 7. Turn Off Screens When With Your Child
**Key insight**: Many children report feeling their parent's phone is the most important thing in parent's life

**Impact**:
- Children will remember being prioritized

- Creates lasting positive memories

### 8. Go Outside and Move Together
**Key insight**: Research confirms children need daily fresh air, greenery, and movement

**Benefits**:
- Essential for de-stressing
- Helps children be their best selves
- Benefits parents equally

### 9. Allow Emotions, Limit Behavior
**Key insight**: When we allow emotions, children learn to manage them faster

**Practice**:
- Set necessary limits while accepting emotional responses
- Acknowledge the emotion behind difficult behavior
- Example: "You must be so upset to use that tone of voice. Tell me about it, Sweetie. We can figure this out together."
- Child begins calming down when emotions are accepted

### 10. Put Yourself Back on the List
**Key insight**: Emotional generosity requires self-care; leaving yourself off the list is unsustainable

**Practice**:
- Prioritize adequate sleep
- Talk to yourself like someone you love
- Monitor well-being throughout the day
- Do something daily that increases joy
- Your good mood will positively affect your child
