# The Research Behind One-on-One Parent-Child Time (Special Time)

## Core Concept: Special Time as Preventive Maintenance

**Special Time** is a structured practice of dedicated one-on-one time between parent and child. It was pioneered by **Patty Wipfler of Hand-in-Hand Parenting** and by **PCIT (Parent-Child Interaction Therapy)**. **Dr. Laura Markham** recommends it as one of five essential preventive maintenance practices for families.

The term "Special Time" is relatively new and not yet widely used under this specific name, which means studies explicitly examining "Special Time" are scarce. However, substantial research exists on what happens when parents spend one-on-one time with their children, even when researchers don't use the term "Special Time."

## Research-Backed Outcomes of One-on-One Parent-Child Time

Children who regularly receive quality one-on-one time with parents demonstrate:
- Higher likelihood of secure attachment
- Better relationships with their parents
- Greater emotional intelligence
- Greater social intelligence
- Fewer behavior problems in school
- Less engagement in risky behaviors
- Generally higher overall well-being

Anecdotal evidence from followers of Dr. Laura Markham, Patty Wipfler, and PCIT practitioners consistently reports that children become happier and more cooperative after implementing Special Time. This aligns with what would be expected from children experiencing higher well-being.

## Self-Assessment Questions for Parents

These questions help parents recognize Special Time's value without needing to review formal research:

1. When you do Special Time, does your child's behavior and demeanor change?
2. Does your child beg for Special Time like it's an essential nutrient they were missing?
3. If you could give your child medicine three times a week that helped them flourish, cooperate, and feel close to you; that helped you be a more responsive parent; that increased trust so your child could tell you anything - and that had no side effects and your child loved taking the medicine - what would you be willing to pay? How about a total of one hour of your time every week?

The framing here emphasizes that Special Time functions like essential medicine with no side effects that the child actually enjoys - making one hour per week (distributed across three sessions) a remarkably worthwhile investment.

## Age-Specific Research Findings

### Early Childhood (Infants, Toddlers, and Preschoolers)

**Building Secure Attachment**

Engaging in one-on-one activities with young children builds a secure parent-child bond characterized by trust and emotional safety (Bowlby, 1988). Focused attention - such as reading together, playing, or talking at bedtime - makes the child feel valued and establishes a foundation for healthy social and emotional development.

The mechanism: When children receive focused individual attention, they internalize that they are worthy of attention and that their parent is reliably available. This creates the secure base from which children can confidently explore their world.

**National Survey Evidence**

A national survey of U.S. families (2016-2017 National Survey of Children's Health) found that parents who frequently spent quality time with their 1- to 5-year-olds - specifically through reading, singing, or storytelling daily - were far more likely to have children who "flourish." This flourishing included having a close, affectionate relationship with the parent.

The inverse was also true: young children who received little one-on-one interaction had lower overall well-being and weaker parent attachment. This demonstrates that the absence of quality time has measurable negative effects, not just that quality time has positive effects.

### Middle Childhood (Elementary School Years)

**Behavior and Bonding Benefits**

Continuing regular individual parent-child time as children grow reduces behavior problems and family conflict. Children who feel loved and receive consistent attention tend to have fewer behavior issues at home and school (Search Institute, 2018).

**Specific outcomes from regular quality one-on-one time:**
- Fewer family arguments
- Less disobedience
- Lower likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors (like drug use) as children get older

The key insight: These protective effects build over time. The benefits of one-on-one time in elementary school years extend into and protect against problems in adolescence.

**The Critical Distinction: Active Engagement vs. Mere Presence**

Longitudinal research following nearly 5,000 U.S. families (Carlson, 2006) revealed an important nuance: greater father-child involvement during middle childhood - specifically frequent personal interactions and engagement - predicted significantly fewer behavior problems by age 15.

Critically, simply living with the child was not enough. It was the father's active one-on-one engagement, not just his presence in the household, that drove better outcomes. This finding has implications for all family structures: physical proximity alone does not create the benefits of quality time. What matters is the deliberate, focused interaction.

### Adolescence (Teen Years)

**Maintaining Connection During Natural Separation**

During teen years, making time for one-on-one interaction is crucial to keep the parent-child relationship strong. A 2025 study of thousands of U.S. families found that "simple, consistent involvement from fathers builds closeness during adolescence."

**Specific effective practices for fathers with teens:**
- Regularly talking with teens
- Helping with homework
- Showing interest in their lives

These relatively simple, consistent behaviors strengthen the parent-teen bond over time. The emphasis on "simple" and "consistent" suggests that elaborate activities are less important than reliable, repeated small moments of connection.

Mothers' involvement matters equally. Although teens naturally spend less time with parents (this is developmentally normal), those who enjoy routine solo conversations or activities with either parent report warmer, more trusting relationships.

**Emotional and Mental Health Benefits**

Warm, supportive parent-teen relationships cultivated through quality time produce tangible benefits for adolescent well-being (Videon, 2005). Teens who feel emotionally close to their parents - meaning they can confide in them and receive support - demonstrate:
- Higher self-esteem
- Lower rates of depression

Specifically, a close father-adolescent relationship was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and better self-image across adolescence. This suggests that father involvement during teen years has protective effects against mental health challenges.

**Practical Recommendations for Teen Years**

Parents who remain available, listen, and communicate one-on-one with their teens foster an affectionate, low-conflict relationship that can buffer against common teenage issues.

Concrete examples of "special" one-on-one moments that preserve closeness and trust during challenging teen years:
- A weekly coffee chat
- A regular walk together

The emphasis on "even something as simple as" indicates that the barrier to entry is low. Parents do not need to plan elaborate outings; regular, predictable small rituals of connection are sufficient and effective.

## Key Principles Across All Ages

**Quality over quantity of presence**: Simply being physically present (living with the child) does not produce the same benefits as active, engaged one-on-one time.

**Consistency matters**: The research repeatedly emphasizes "regular" and "consistent" interaction. Sporadic intense quality time appears less effective than smaller, reliable doses.

**The effects compound**: Benefits observed in one developmental stage (like middle childhood) carry forward and protect against problems in later stages (like adolescence).

**Both parents matter**: While several studies specifically examined father involvement (likely because mother involvement was historically assumed), the principles apply to both parents. Teens report better relationships with whichever parent provides consistent one-on-one time.

**Simple activities suffice**: Reading, singing, storytelling, talking, walking, having coffee together - none of these require special resources or elaborate planning. The activity matters less than the focused attention and emotional availability.
