## Summary

This article provides comprehensive guidance for parents on keeping children safe online. It addresses internet safety, screen addiction, social media management, porn exposure prevention, and cyberbullying. The core message is that while children may know more about technology, parents know more about life and have the responsibility to supervise, educate, and set appropriate boundaries.

## Key Insights

### The Nature of the Internet
- The internet is like a city: full of valuable resources but also holding dangers for the unprepared

### Screen Addiction Reality

- Social media use correlates with increased depression and anxiety
- Not all screen use is problematic - educational, creative, and connection purposes can be positive
- Parents must actively support children in managing their screen relationship

### Parental Responsibilities
1. **Be the computer administrator** - Use monitoring software and parental controls
2. **Require friending** on all social network accounts
3. **Set maximum privacy settings** on all accounts
4. **Don't allow age-lying** to join social networks
