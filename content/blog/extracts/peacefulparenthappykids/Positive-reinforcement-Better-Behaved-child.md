# Your Child, Better Behaved in Three Days

## Core Principle: Energy Follows Attention

**Children are like emotional geiger counters** - they live for parental emotional energy, whether positive or negative. The fundamental insight is that children will follow whatever receives the most intense parental energy. This creates a paradox in traditional parenting: parents tend to give their most powerful emotional responses (more emotion, facial expression, volume, intense relationship) when things go wrong, which inadvertently "waters the weeds" by directing energy toward unwanted behaviors.

The gardening metaphor captures this precisely: **what we focus on grows**. If you stop watering weeds and start watering flowers, you transform your home into a garden. This is not about ignoring problems but about strategically redirecting where your emotional energy flows.

## The Energy Asymmetry Problem

Traditional parenting creates a significant energy imbalance between responses to negative versus positive behavior:

**Typical negative response** (high energy, high volume, high emotion): "How many times do I have to tell you?!"

**Typical positive acknowledgment** (low energy, perfunctory): "Good job, dear."

This asymmetry teaches children that misbehavior is the reliable path to receiving intense parental engagement. The solution is not to eliminate limits but to reverse the energy distribution - bring high, enthusiastic energy to positive behaviors while handling transgressions with calm, warm redirection.

## The Self-Criticism Trap

Parents rarely acknowledge the hundreds of things they do right. Instead, they berate themselves when they lose patience. This creates a vicious cycle: **feeling bad inside does not help parents feel emotionally generous toward their children** - it actually makes parents more likely to "come unglued" next time.

The reasoning behind starting with self-compassion: **you can only give your child what you have inside**. An empty cup cannot pour. Self-berating depletes the internal resources needed for patient, positive parenting.

## The Three-Day Transformation Framework

### Day 1: Replenish Your Emotional Generosity

**Goal**: Build your internal capacity to give positive energy by directing it toward yourself first.

**Practice**: Enthusiastically acknowledge everything you do right. Become your own cheerleader. When you miss your goal, offer yourself encouragement to get back on track rather than criticism.

**Why this comes first**: This is the foundation because you cannot sustainably give children what you do not possess. Filling your own cup first is not selfish - it is prerequisite.

**Note**: Continue this practice throughout Days 2 and 3. It is not abandoned but built upon.

### Day 2: Build Connection Through Positive Energy

**Goal**: Ensure your child does not have to "act out" to get your full attention.

**Core technique**: Show up with presence and respond with excited energy to every positive thing your child does. **Set the bar low** - make it easy for them to succeed by encouraging any progress in the right direction.

**Specific examples throughout the day**:
- Give a big hug when they wake up in the morning
- If they dawdle, move them along with connection and enthusiasm rather than nagging
- Make breakfast calm and connected to send positive energy
- Thank them for handling the morning routine beautifully, even though they do it every day (acknowledge the ordinary)
- Tell them before school how much you're looking forward to seeing them at the end of the day
- When reunited after school, spend time laughing and roughhousing together
- Have a family dance party before dinner
- Listen at dinner as they share tales about their day
- Notice and comment when they kept working on homework without giving up despite frustration
- Notice when they were nice to a sibling (even if the rest of the evening they weren't so nice) - catch the moments of goodness
- Thank them for taking their bath with only one reminder
- Tell them how lucky you are to be their parent

**When you cannot find anything positive in current behavior**: Even the most badly behaved child has moments of good behavior. Your job is to find them and give them positive energy. You can also share positive memories:
- "I was just remembering that time when you were so brave and..."
- "Remember that time when your teacher was so impressed that you...?"
- "You've always been the best at making your little sister smile. Why, I remember when..."

**Expected outcome**: By the end of the day, you should see your child blossoming - warming up to you and trying to cooperate.

**Troubleshooting**: Not working? Maybe your child needs another day to believe you mean it. Children may be skeptical at first if the pattern has been negative. Persistence signals authenticity.

### Day 3: Transform Your Response to Transgressions

**Goal**: Stop giving your emotional energy to challenging behavior while still setting appropriate limits.

**Key mindset shift**: Of course she doesn't always behave - she's a child and still learning self-regulation. This is normal and expected, not a crisis requiring intense negative response.

**The technique combines several elements**:

1. **Acknowledge their perspective** as you set limits
2. Use a **calm, warm, energetic tone** in which your child can hear your engagement even as you set limits
3. **Connect before you correct**
4. **Tell your child what they CAN do**, not just what they can't
5. Redirect to appropriate alternatives

**Example 1 - Pushing a sibling**:
"It looks like you wanted your sister to move, so you pushed her. No pushing; pushing hurts. Say 'Move please!'"

This acknowledges the underlying need (wanting sister to move), sets the limit clearly (no pushing, with the reason why), and provides the alternative behavior (use words instead).

**Example 2 - Driving car into brother's game**:
"Are you trying to tell your brother that you want to play, so you're driving your car into his game? Your brother is saying he doesn't want to play right now. Why don't you drive your car over here to help me with this instead?"

This interprets the behavior as communication, validates the desire to play, relays the brother's boundary, and redirects to an acceptable alternative.

## Why Ignoring Misbehavior Backfires

**All behavior is communication**. If your child is acting out, they are acting out feelings they cannot express in words. If you ignore it when they act out, they will have to escalate to get you to pay attention - which is the last thing you want.

The correct response is to:
1. Acknowledge the communication (what they're trying to express)
2. Set any necessary limits
3. Redirect to what they CAN do to meet their need

**Extended example - child acting superior to sibling**:

"You're telling your sister that you know a lot more than she does. It feels good to know things, doesn't it? And it can feel good to know more than other people, because it makes us feel like we're better than someone else. But knowing more doesn't mean we're better people. And you can enjoy how much you know without trying to make your sister feel bad. Our family rule is 'Be Kind,' remember?"

This acknowledges the underlying feeling (it feels good to know things), validates the impulse without judgment (we all have this), provides the correction (knowing more doesn't mean being better), gives the positive alternative (enjoy knowledge without putting others down), and references the family value.

**Then, connect and get them laughing**:
- Whisper something that will get them giggling
- Kiss all over their ear and head as you whisper to get them laughing
- Whisper "I bet you can't catch me!" and start a chase game ending collapsed on the couch laughing

The point is: **instead of responding to negative energy from your child with negative energy of your own, respond with loving connection** - which might include acknowledgment, hugs, or laughter.

## Critical Distinction: Limits Without Negative Energy

The approach is NOT about eliminating limits or being permissive. You ARE setting the limits that need to be set. The difference is that you are not giving negative energy to them. Instead, you use the opportunity to give your child the positive energy of loving guidance and redirection.

Limits are set clearly:
- "No pushing; pushing hurts"
- "Our family rule is 'Be Kind,' remember?"

But the delivery is warm, engaged, and solution-focused rather than angry, punitive, or shaming.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of the week, if you maintain these three habits, you will see:
- More of the behavior you're giving energy to
- Less of the behavior you aren't giving energy to
- More cooperation and affection from your child
- More confidence and energy as a parent

## Quote from Howard Glasser

"Children equate being loved with the reality of when we are there for them - when we really show up. But traditional methods have us showing up so much more when there are problems. Conventional wisdom tells parents that the time to emit more energy - that is, more emotion, more facial expression, more volume, and more intense relationship - is when things are going wrong. That's a mistake, and a big one, because it puts our powerful parental energy to work growing more of the behaviors we actually want to see less of. Why water weeds?"

## Summary: The Three Sustained Practices

1. **Self-acknowledgment and encouragement** - maintain your internal emotional resources
2. **Proactive positive attention** - don't wait for misbehavior to show up with energy; flood the positive moments with enthusiastic engagement
3. **Calm, connected limit-setting** - handle transgressions as teaching opportunities with warmth, acknowledging the child's perspective while redirecting to acceptable alternatives

The transformation happens because the child's reliable path to intense parental engagement shifts from misbehavior to cooperation. Children follow energy. Redirect the energy, and behavior follows.
