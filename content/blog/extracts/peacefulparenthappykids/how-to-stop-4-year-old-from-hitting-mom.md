# Understanding and Stopping a 4-Year-Old's Physical Aggression Toward Mom

## Core Framework: Reframing the Behavior

### This Is Not Abuse or Disrespect

When a young child hits their parent, it is not abuse. **Abuse requires an imbalance of power** - a four-year-old and an adult do not have equal power, so the child cannot "abuse" the parent in the true sense. The child is getting physical when angry, which needs to stop, but calling it abuse misframes the situation.

Similarly, hitting is not a sign of disrespect. It is **a communication about something going on inside the child that they cannot articulate**. The distinction matters because if you interpret it as disrespect, you'll respond punitively; if you understand it as communication, you'll respond therapeutically.

### The Real Need Behind the Hitting

When a child hits, their need is not actually to hurt you, even if the child thinks it is. **The underlying need is to express feelings and be heard**, which allows them to move past those emotions. Respecting a child's needs never means allowing yourself to be repeatedly hurt.

### Why Children Need Parents to Stay Safe

Children need to know that parents will keep themselves safe from the child's anger for two critical reasons:

1. **Otherwise, their anger becomes too scary** - If a child can actually hurt their parent, the child's own anger feels overwhelming and dangerous
2. **Children need confidence that parents can handle their big emotions** - They know they cannot control their own anger, and they are terrified at the idea that they can hurt their parent

It is the parent's job not to let the child hurt them. This is protective of both parent and child.

## Root Causes of a Child Hitting Only Mom

### Reason 1: The Child Has Learned That Hitting Gets Results

If hitting or aggression has ever resulted in the child getting what they wanted, even occasionally, the child may have learned this is an effective strategy.

**The cure**: Ensure that hurting you never results in getting the requested treat or attention. When she demands something and moves to attack:
- Sidestep her and do not let her hurt you
- Say: "I see how disappointed you are. You really want that and I said No. You can tell me in words. I won't let you hurt me."

### Reason 2: Big Repressed Feelings That Scare the Child

When big feelings bubble up, the child may beg for candy or a movie **to numb herself**. When the parent says no, she gets desperate because now those feelings are surfacing without her numbing mechanism. So she lashes out.

**Key insight**: Children (like adults) often use movies and treats to regulate their feelings. When a child rigidly demands a treat and becomes aggressive when denied, this often indicates **big feelings locked away inside that she is trying to keep repressed**.

**How this manifests**: The child may feel that her well-being depends on getting this treat, that she MUST have it. This kind of rigidity signals internal emotional pressure.

### Reason 3: No Confidence in Other Methods

If the child does not believe that calmer ways of asking will get her needs met, she may resort to aggression as her "reliable" method.

**The message to give**: "I see you have some big feelings and you are trying to hurt me to get my attention. You never need to hurt me to get my attention. Just say 'Mommy, I need you!' and I will always help you."

### Reason 4: Normal Four-Year-Old Power Experimentation

Four-year-olds naturally experiment with power and learn what works to get what they want in the world. If hitting has been allowed to continue, the child simply continues because it has been permitted.

**This does not make her a bad person, just a four-year-old.** It is the parent's job to help children learn more satisfying ways of interacting.

### Reason 5: Lack of Empathy Development (Less Likely Here)

Children who have not been treated with empathy may not develop empathy themselves. However, if the parent recognizes there is a reason behind the child's actions and expresses understanding, this factor is likely not at play.

### Reason 6: Being Hurt Physically (Ruled Out Here)

Children who are physically hurt sometimes act out physically. This should always be considered but can often be ruled out based on circumstances.

## The Mechanism: Fear Drives Aggression

**When children are in the grip of fear, they often act out aggressively.** The anger is actually a defense mechanism - "the best defense is a good offense." The child attacks to fend off the scary feelings that are bubbling up.

**The pathway to resolution**: Help the child feel safe enough to move beyond "fight mode" and get to the fear underneath. Rage does not dissipate until it feels heard. The best way to disarm anger is to really hear it - acknowledge how much she wants this and how angry she is, and encourage her to use words.

## The "Meltdown" as Healing

**Key principle**: When children "feel" their emotions fully, the feelings evaporate and the child is free to move on, unfettered. But often children are frightened of their big emotions and will do anything to fend them off. They "stuff" their feelings and keep them down with food, screens, etc.

**The pattern**: Big feelings push to get out, which is often what's behind children's rigid and aggressive behavior. When kids act this way, they are showing us they need help feeling safe enough to experience their feelings.

**After the release**: After the wave of fear passes, the child will probably collapse into the parent's arms in tears. She may cry and cry. This is the child letting out a whole "backpack" of feelings that have been pressuring her. The change in demeanor afterward is remarkable - the child becomes cooperative and affectionate, and no longer cares about whatever she so desperately needed before the meltdown. She becomes free and flexible, not hampered by the pressure of "stuffed" emotion.

## The Physical Holding Technique

### When to Use It

When the child comes at you and won't stop, she is asking you to "hold" her aggression in check. This is a technique for when verbal intervention is not enough.

### How to Do It

1. When she lashes out, sit right down on the floor
2. Invite her onto your lap: "Oh, Sweetie, you are so upset...You really want to watch a movie right now...You are very angry that I won't let you...But I won't let you hurt me, I will keep us both safe."
3. If she continues to try to hurt you, hold her with her back to you, with your arms around her (this position mostly protects you from her)
4. Be as gentle as possible. Keep your voice calm and soothing
5. When she objects, say: "I will just hold you to keep us both safe. You can show me all those feelings."
6. Never hurt her - this is not a punishment, only to keep her from hurting you

### What to Expect During Holding

- She will struggle and get sweaty and red-faced and yell - **this is what it looks like when kids release fear**
- Keep breathing and remind yourself you are helping her "show you" her fear
- Don't talk much (talking pulls her out of feelings and into her head). Just say "You're safe...I'm right here..." every so often
- Hold as gently and loosely as possible, only enough so she doesn't hurt you
- The upset could last half an hour, but you should not have to hold her for most of this - only hold as much as needed to prevent being hurt

### The Bargaining Pattern

She may say "Ok, let me go, I won't hurt you" and then turn around and kick you. If this happens:
- Take a deep breath to let out your anger so you don't scare her
- Gently scoop her back onto your lap
- This time, don't let her go while she struggles
- Say: "I know you say you won't hurt me, but you just did, and I need to keep us both safe. Don't worry, I will never hurt you. I will let you go as soon as you can keep your hands from hitting."

**Why struggling against you is okay**: Kids often need to struggle against the parent to express fear. They are often satisfied if the parent holds up a couch pillow and they struggle against the pillow.

**Children are grateful for this opportunity**: In experience, children are excited when parents offer them a safe place to "show" their emotions. It seems as if they hit to get attention, but once the parent is attending, they stop hitting. They are not actually trying to hurt - it is the parent's job to keep the interaction feeling safe for both while big feelings come up.

## Three Critical Caveats for the Holding Technique

### Caveat 1: Never for Abused Children

Never use even gentle restraint for a child who has been abused in any way. Even gentle restraint could recreate the feeling of abuse. This technique is only appropriate when parent and child have an excellent relationship and the child needs to know the parent will provide a safe "holding environment" for her rage.

### Caveat 2: Not When the Parent Is Triggered

**If your feelings are so triggered by being attacked that you feel angry, you cannot hold her in a loving way.** This is never a punishment - it is only to keep her from hitting you. But if you are triggered and angry, she will pick that up and it will keep her from feeling safe, which defeats the whole purpose.

**What to do instead when triggered**: Keep breathing, work to regulate your own emotions, muster as much empathy as you can verbally, and keep yourself from getting hurt. You can usually establish a verbal bridge with your child so she feels supported enough to move through her fear. It is far better to leave the room than to find yourself in an angry physical interaction with your child.

### Caveat 3: Trust Your Instincts About Your Child

You know your daughter better than anyone. If holding her triggers her and makes her feel less safe, you will see that. Your goal is a sense of safety, not punishment, ever. If this does not work for your child, don't do it.

**If holding doesn't work initially**: For kids to feel safe in such a situation, they usually need the parent to spend daily time simply connecting, so they deeply trust the parent's commitment to supporting them. Spend a few weeks connecting through daily special time, then try the holding technique again.

**The bottom line**: When kids lash out physically, it is harder to keep yourself safe without holding, but it can be done, and eventually they will still get to the same place of getting past anger to surface and let go of tears and fears.

## Why Not to Remove Yourself (Abandonment Trigger)

Many parents respond to their child's aggression by removing themselves (going into another room and closing the door). **This triggers the child's panic about abandonment.**

**The message removal sends**: We cannot deal with her big feelings, and she is not ok if she has them. If she wants our love, she had better just swallow them and shut them down.

**The problem with this**: Feelings that are repressed this way are always bubbling below the surface, pushing against us, looking for a way out. They are below conscious control, so they push us to make choices that later make us wonder "What on earth was I thinking?" To keep repressed emotions inside, we often resort to "little addictions" - food, shopping, TV.

**The recommendation**: Do NOT banish your child to her room to subdue her feelings. Instead, stay with her while she rages, empathizing as best you can to help her feel safe.

## Special Time: The Preventive Medicine

### Structure

- Schedule daily "Special Time"
- Call it by the child's name (the most special name there is)
- Plan on 15 minutes
- Every other day: Do whatever she wants for 15 minutes - this builds her sense of trust and confidence that her happiness matters to you. Think of it as "filling her cup."
- The other days: Help her fix any "blocks" developing that keep her from taking in all that love. Think of this as "cup maintenance."

### Why Special Time Works

It is best to give attention pre-emptively, rather than waiting for the child to hurt you to get it. Special time changes the relationship by building trust so the child can let feelings out and is no longer driven by them.

**Even with a good relationship**: If the child felt it was safe to show her big feelings, she would not be hitting. Kids hit because of inner turmoil. Special time builds trust so feelings can come out.

### Cup Maintenance: Giggling Games

**Blocks to feeling loved are usually unexpressed big feelings.** Luckily, crying is not the only way to get those feelings out - **giggling works almost as well.**

Play games that get her giggling. Any game that gets to the issue of fear, but in a light enough way that she can giggle about it, will work.

**Specific game recommendations**:

**Pillow fights**: Especially good with aggressive kids, partly because they let you get your own aggression out.

**Scary witch game**: Take turns being a scary witch. Often kids will say "How about we play _____, and I will be the ______, and you be scared of me." If she takes the lead, go with it. Ham it up to keep the giggles coming.

**Playing "MAD" game**: Do this during special time when both are feeling good and connected, not angry.
- Say: "Let's play MAD! You be mad first."
- Let her act mad
- Wink so she knows this is still a game
- Say: "You are very mad, but I am SuperMom and you can't hurt me!"
- She will try to grab or hit you playfully - jump out of her way
- She should giggle (if she doesn't giggle, you're on the wrong track - switch gears)
- Keep letting her chase you and jumping out of her way as long as she is still giggling
- If you or she get tired, you can suggest reversing it
- When you chase her and try to grab her, always let her be more powerful and get away

**Purpose of the MAD game**: Discharges tension that has built up in both parent and child around the hitting issue.

## The Parent's Inner Work

### Examining Your Own History

**Question to consider**: Has someone in your past made you feel like it was ok for you to be hurt? When we find ourselves in a box like this, it is usually a box from our pasts.

**Suggested processing**:
- Journal about this
- Talk to a friend or counselor
- This doesn't have to be a long process - maybe just twenty minutes with a candle, writing a letter to the part of yourself that needs protecting

**Expected outcome**: A new clarity of care for yourself, which will help change what is happening with your daughter. So often issues with children offer an opportunity to heal ourselves - this is one of the greatest gifts of raising children.

### Being Clear Within Yourself

If you are clear that no person, even your daughter, has the right to hit you, then you will not allow yourself to be hit. The parent who successfully taught her daughter not to hit peers can apply the same principle to herself by seeing it as just as unthinkable that the child would hurt her.

## Key Distinctions and Nuances

### Aggressive Behavior During Tantrums vs. Strategic Aggression

**Tantrum-based aggression**: Child is in the grip of fear, acting out aggressively. Parent needs to protect themselves but stay present to help them get below anger to the fear that fuels it. Meltdowns help kids surface and release fears so they aren't driven to lash out.

**Strategic aggression** (this case): Child is not having emotional meltdowns. She is aggressive when she wants something - presence or a treat she feels is being withheld. This requires a different approach focused on not rewarding the behavior while still helping access underlying feelings.

### Why She Only Hits Mom

The child hits the person she is closest to because that's the person she feels safest showing her big feelings to. Paradoxically, being the target of aggression can indicate you are the most trusted relationship.

### The Universal Strategy: Best Defense Is Good Offense

When big feelings bubble up and the child's numbing strategy (treat/movie) is denied, she attacks. This is a universal human strategy - attacking to fend off overwhelming feelings. Understanding this helps the parent not take the hitting personally while still not allowing it.
