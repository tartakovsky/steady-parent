# When Children Hit Themselves or Call Themselves Names

## Understanding Why Three-Year-Olds Hit Themselves

Three-year-olds face a fundamental developmental gap: they can clearly see what they want to accomplish but often lack the skills to do it. Tasks like using scissors, dribbling a ball, or pouring juice are within their vision but beyond their current ability. This mismatch creates intense frustration.

Some children are born more **perfectionistic** than others, which amplifies this frustration. When three-year-olds can't handle their frustration emotionally, they often express it physically. The self-hitting behavior typically emerges because the child already knows they can't hit others, so they redirect that physical impulse toward themselves. The child in this example only hits himself once when he trips or fails at a task, and said "I hate myself" when unable to put on his socks - both responses to his own perceived failures.

## The Two-Part Goal for Parents

When addressing self-hitting and self-critical behavior, parents have two distinct objectives:

1. **Help the child find alternative ways to manage and release frustration** - because the child needs constructive outlets for the physical energy that builds up during frustration
2. **Help the child develop self-compassion** - because the underlying issue is that the child is being harsh with themselves rather than accepting that learning takes time

## Six Strategies for Responding to Self-Hitting and Self-Criticism

### 1. Model Compassionate Behavior Toward Everyone, Including Yourself

This is identified as the most fundamental intervention because parents are their child's **primary teacher**. Children learn self-treatment by watching how their parents treat themselves and others.

The practice has two components:
- **Extend understanding toward others** - demonstrate that people deserve compassion when they struggle
- **Notice when you're hard on yourself** - this is the harder part for most parents

**Concrete technique**: When you catch yourself making a mean comment to yourself, stop in your tracks and give yourself compassionate understanding instead. Do this aloud so your child can hear and learn from it. The child needs to witness the actual process of self-compassion, not just be told about it.

### 2. Give Language for the Frustration

Children need help naming and normalizing their emotional experience. Provide words that:
- Acknowledge the specific difficulty: "Those socks are so tough"
- Validate the emotional response: "I know, that's frustrating"

This serves multiple purposes: it shows the child they're understood, teaches emotional vocabulary, and helps the child feel less alone in their struggle.

### 3. Provide Hope Alongside Acknowledgment

After validating frustration, immediately offer perspective that prevents the child from concluding they're permanently inadequate:

- **Normalize the struggle developmentally**: "Most three year olds can't do that by themselves" - this removes the sense that the child is uniquely failing
- **Point toward future competence**: "You're getting really close. Soon you will be able to do this" - this maintains motivation and prevents hopelessness

The pairing of acknowledgment with hope is important: acknowledgment alone could feel like confirmation of inadequacy, while hope alone could feel dismissive of the real difficulty.

### 4. Evaluate Your Parenting Style for Punishment-Based Approaches

**Key insight**: When children hit themselves, it is often a response to a discipline style that includes punishment. The child is internalizing the punishment dynamic and applying it to themselves.

This includes:
- Traditional punishments
- Time-outs
- "Consequences" (when used as punishment by another name)

**Why this matters**: Children who are already perfectionistic and hard on themselves will have that tendency reinforced by punishment-based discipline. They don't need external harshness added to their internal harshness.

The recommendation is to shift toward **positive discipline** approaches that support healthy emotional development alongside behavioral guidance.

### 5. Address the Self-Hitting Directly But Carefully

**Initial response** when you see the child hit themselves:

First, state the family rule: "We don't hit in this family, even ourselves." This extends the no-hitting rule consistently rather than making self-harm an exception.

Second, acknowledge the underlying emotion: "I know you're frustrated."

Third, redirect to an alternative: "Let's find another way to handle it."

**Teach a concrete stress management technique - deep breathing**:
- "Good air in" (deep breath)
- "Count to ten"
- "Breathe out through your mouth"

**After the initial teaching**: Don't make a big deal when you see the self-hitting, to avoid reinforcing the behavior through attention. Instead:
- Immediately address the underlying feeling: "You seem pretty frustrated"
- Offer the alternative you've taught: "Let's breathe deeply together"

**The logic of this approach**: Making a big deal of the hitting could inadvertently reinforce it by giving it attention. The focus should shift to the emotion and the coping skill, not the problematic behavior itself.

### 6. Help the Child Learn to Manage Emotions More Broadly

The self-hitting behavior is a symptom of the larger need to develop **emotional intelligence** - the ability to handle difficult feelings. This is an ongoing developmental task, not a single intervention.

## Prognosis

This behavior is likely to be outgrown fairly quickly, but it represents a valuable opportunity to teach emotional regulation skills that will serve the child throughout life. The focus should be on using this moment to build lasting competence rather than just eliminating the immediate behavior.

## Warning: What NOT to Do

- **Don't punish the self-hitting** - this would reinforce the child's harsh treatment of themselves
- **Don't make a big deal of the behavior after initially addressing it** - attention can reinforce unwanted behaviors
- **Don't dismiss or minimize the frustration** - the child needs to feel understood
- **Don't give hope without acknowledgment** - this feels dismissive
- **Don't only acknowledge without giving hope** - this could confirm the child's sense of inadequacy
