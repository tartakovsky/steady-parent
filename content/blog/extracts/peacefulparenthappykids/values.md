# How Children Learn Values and How Parents Can Teach Them

Source: https://www.peacefulparenthappykids.com/read/values

## Core Premise: Values Cannot Be Taught Through Lectures, But They Are Always Being Taught

The central insight is that telling children to be honest, diligent, or considerate does not work any better than telling adults to be those things. However, this does not mean values are left to chance. Children learn values every minute of their lives by observing what their parents do and drawing conclusions about what their parents think is important. The question is never whether to teach values, only what values are being taught through daily behavior.

Schools face structural limitations in teaching values because they intervene too late in development and operate in isolation from the rest of the child's life. Worse, school-based values instruction often contradicts what children learn at home, creating confusion rather than clarity.

## The Primacy of Parental Influence Over Peer Influence

While peers certainly influence children, especially during teenage years, research shows that the strength of the parent-child relationship determines how much peer influence matters. When the relationship is strong, the child filters the entire world, including peer opinions, through values acquired from parents. Additionally, children with good self-esteem and warm home lives tend to select friends whose values align with parental values, creating a reinforcing cycle rather than a competing one.

## Media as a Values Teacher

Television is an effective teacher, but most commercial television teaches values antithetical to what most parents want. Specifically, commercial TV has documented negative effects on children's values around:
- Acquisitiveness (wanting material things)
- Sex
- Violence
- Race
- Gender

Public television tends to have more positive social messages for young children. The recommendation is to minimize having "another voice in your home spouting antithetical values." Despite the power of media, schools, religious institutions, peer groups, movies, and books, most teenagers still identify their parents as the primary source of their values.

## What Values Actually Encompass

Values include two categories:
1. **What you hold dear**: family, education, democracy, equal dignity for all people
2. **What you think it is important to be**: compassionate, hard-working, honest

### Comprehensive Lists of Values from Experts

**Michael Gurian's Ten Moral Competencies**: decency, fairness, empathy, self-sacrifice, responsibility, loyalty, duty, service, honesty, honor

**Martin Seligman's Character Strengths** (from happiness research): includes Gurian's list plus humility, self-control, love of learning, industriousness, leadership, caution, and playfulness. The key insight here is that happiness results from developing character strengths.

**Linda and Richard Eyre's Additions**: courage, peaceability, self-reliance, dependability, chastity, respect, love, unselfishness, and mercy

The warning is that reeling off such a list to a child accomplishes nothing because the words are meaningless out of context. The teaching happens through application to real situations.

## The Gap Between Stated Values and Lived Values

A crucial complication: what humans say they believe and what they actually do in practice are often different. People do not always act on their values. Therefore, what children will do when faced with difficult choices depends more on who they are than on what they say they believe.

## The Role of Emotional Health in Values Development

Acting from the "good" inside us becomes more likely when anger, anxiety, and low self-esteem do not get in the way. Children who are cherished and emotionally attended to are more likely to respond compassionately to others, even from an early age. This creates an important sequence: parents who prioritize their relationship with their child have an easier time teaching values because their children have been raised empathically and are therefore more likely to treat others kindly.

However, this does not eliminate the need to explicitly articulate values. Parents must still articulate values to themselves first, then to children, not just once but repeatedly, applying those values to daily life situations and dilemmas the child faces.

## Practical Methods for Teaching Values

### 1. Make Values Relevant to the Child's World

Values seem theoretical until children start talking about their own lives, which are full of values-laden decisions. Real examples by age:

- **Age 6**: Is the child allowed to break a date with a friend to accept another, much more exciting invitation? (Loyalty vs. self-interest)
- **Age 8**: How much help should the child accept from parents on school projects? (Integrity vs. achievement)
- **Age 10**: Should the child leave the neighborhood soccer team mid-season when recruited to a more professional team, knowing their exit will hurt their old team since they are the best player? (Loyalty and commitment vs. personal advancement)
- **Age 12**: Should the child invite a girl to her birthday party who some other girls look down on, but whose party she attended? (Reciprocity, fairness, courage to resist peer pressure)
- **Age 14**: Should the child tell the teacher that some kids are cheating on the test? (Honesty vs. peer loyalty, the snitch dilemma)
- **Age 16**: Should the teenager do volunteer work she does not care about because it will look good on college applications? (Authenticity vs. strategic self-presentation)

The key teaching: handling these decisions is what develops values. Parents should not miss the opportunity to support children in making conscious decisions through these dilemmas.

### 2. Recognize the Power of Modeling

The core principle: it is not what you say, it is what you do.

**Specific example of modeling contradiction**: If parents tell children that soccer is about fun, skills, exercise, and teamwork, but the first question after every game is "Who won?", children learn that winning is more important than anything else the parent claims to value.

**Specific example of honesty contradiction**: If parents talk about honesty but lie about the child's age to get a cheaper ticket at the amusement park, two things happen: (1) the child is put in an uncomfortable position, and (2) the child learns that cheating is acceptable under certain circumstances.

### 3. Develop Empathy as the Foundation

Empathy is the foundation of compassion, which is the foundation of values. This creates a clear hierarchy: empathy -> compassion -> values.

**Critical teaching method**: Children do not learn empathy by being told to feel it. The only way children can learn empathy is by being treated empathically themselves and by watching parents respond to others with compassion and kindness.

### 4. Talk Explicitly About Values and Their Importance

Parents should directly address questions like:
- What IS integrity?
- What is our obligation to our neighbor?
- What if that neighbor does not look like us?
- Why is respectful behavior important in a church, synagogue, or mosque?

This explicit interpretation of the world is described as a crucial responsibility of parents.

### 5. Explain the Values Behind Your Decisions

Use everyday choices as teaching opportunities. Voting provides a rich example: Why are you voting for that candidate? Why are you voting at all? The suggestion is to let the child help you vote after you pull the curtain shut, making them an active participant in values-based decision-making.

### 6. Label and Reinforce Values When You See Them

When you observe your child demonstrating a value you care about, recognize it as specifically as possible. Examples of effective reinforcement language:

- **Kindness**: "I noticed how kind you were to Ben when you tried to cheer him up."
- **Honesty**: "I really appreciated that you were honest with me about what happened at school."
- **Generosity**: "How generous of you to give one of your stuffed animals to Carmen!"
- **Resourcefulness**: "You figured out all by yourself how to get the homework assignment you missed. That's what I call resourceful!"

The specificity matters. Generic praise ("good job") teaches nothing. Specific labeling helps children connect their behavior to named values.

### 7. Avoid Lecturing

The warning: most humans experience lectures as alienating. Even when moments seem "teachable," they only work when children are ready to learn.

**Alternative approach**: Ask questions to find out more about the decisions the child is making and the thinking behind those decisions. Share your own views sparingly. The reasoning is that children learn more from the process of articulating their dilemmas and noticing the moral implications of their choices than they would from a lecture. A secondary benefit is that questioning and listening maintains connection with the child.

### 8. Model Community Involvement

Children need to see parents committed to the welfare of the larger community, whether that means running for school board or volunteering at church.

**Key teaching to communicate**: Help children appreciate how the invisible work of others helps each of us daily. Teach that the more blessings we have in our lives, the more responsibility we have to extend help to others. This creates a proportional relationship between privilege and responsibility.

### 9. Volunteer as a Family

Engage in community service projects together, from coat drives to visiting nursing homes on Valentine's Day.

**Important practical note**: Children may need leadership and coaxing to be willing to volunteer initially. The experience at a local soup kitchen is given as an example where the children needed encouragement but ended up loving it and wanting to do it again. This suggests not giving up at initial resistance.

### 10. Support Child-Initiated Values Projects

When children decide to start their own values-based initiatives (example given: a "Clean Up the Park" club with kindergarten friends), help them organize it in a way that is manageable and safe. The principle is that the world is full of projects that kids have launched to make the world a better place, and every child has to start somewhere.

### 11. Confront Cultural Messages About Money

Responsible use of money is identified as a value that is particularly challenging to teach in acquisitive culture. The sequence matters: parents need to get clear about their own values around money first before teaching children.

**Questions parents should consider**:
- Is being a millionaire an appropriate goal in life?
- When the child loses their cell phone, should they pay for the new one?
- Is it okay for the child to spend all their bat mitzvah gift money on themselves?
- Even if the family can afford to pay for college, should the child work a summer job to contribute?

### 12. Use Media as Discussion Starters

Choose books to read and movies to watch with children with the express goal of building character. However, careful choice is not enough. Discussion is required.

**Discussion prompts**: Does the child think the character made the right decision? Why or why not?

**Dinner table strategy**: Come prepared with questions to start discussion. Share ethical dilemmas from your own day. These are everywhere if you pay attention, from cutting someone off in traffic to sharing gossip.

### 13. Structure Allowance to Include Charity

All children should have the opportunity to contribute their own money to charity. The recommended system is a **tripartite allowance**:

1. **Spending money**: The lion's share, for the child's own use
2. **Savings**: To help buy larger items like a bike, presents for friends, or contribute to a class trip
3. **Charity (or Tzedaka)**: To be given away to a worthy cause the child chooses

The Jewish concept of Tzedaka is noted as meaning "restoring Justice," which frames charitable giving not as optional kindness but as a justice obligation.

**Timing suggestions**: Birthday or holiday season work well for making charity contributions, but anytime is acceptable. Some children will be moved by news reports of people in need and will want to contribute immediately.

**Parent option**: Offer to match the child's charitable contributions.

### 14. Teach Good Sportsmanship Explicitly

While some people seem more competitive than others from birth, everyone needs to be taught how to be a good sport. This is not natural and requires active teaching and modeling.

**Goals of sportsmanship teaching**:
- Help the child find genuine solace in a game well played (independent of outcome)
- Help the child mean it when saying "Good game!" to every opponent, whether they have lost or won

### 15. Communicate Faith That Doing Right Is Worth It

Children need to know that doing the right thing is not only the right thing to do but the satisfying thing to do, deep inside, even when it costs something. The observation is made that hard moral choices always cost us something.

**Beliefs that support moral behavior**: To be the people we want to be, we need to believe things that are not provably true:
- Most people are mostly good
- Crime does not pay
- Good conquers evil
- It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all

**The "why does it matter" question**: Most children eventually ask "Why does it matter what one person does, if no one ever knows?" The author's personal answer is "The angels need our help." Every parent will have a different answer, but the question must be addressed.

## Summary Framework

The overall approach can be understood as operating at multiple levels simultaneously:

1. **Relationship foundation**: Prioritize the parent-child relationship and treat children empathically, because emotionally secure children are more likely to develop compassion
2. **Behavioral modeling**: Ensure your actions align with stated values, because children learn from observation, not instruction
3. **Explicit discussion**: Talk about values directly, but through questions and real dilemmas rather than lectures
4. **Real-world application**: Use the child's actual life situations as the curriculum for values development
5. **Structured practice**: Create systems (like tripartite allowance) and activities (like family volunteering) that give children practice living values
6. **Cultural resistance**: Actively counter messages from media and culture that contradict family values
7. **Faith communication**: Help children believe that moral behavior is intrinsically worthwhile, not just instrumentally useful

The Theodore Roosevelt quote captures the stakes: "To educate a person in mind and not morals is to educate a menace to society."
