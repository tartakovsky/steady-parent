# Supporting Children Who May Be Nonbinary

## Core Philosophy: Taking Cues From Your Child

The fundamental principle is to **take your cue from your kids**. This means supporting their interests and expressions without making assumptions in either direction - not assuming they will be gender conforming, and not assuming they will be nonbinary or trans. The parent's role is to support exploration without pushing any agenda.

This matters because our choice of whether to support our child won't change who they actually are - but it will change how they feel about themselves. Children who are nonbinary and suffer mental health challenges are often responding not only to cultural pressures but also to the pressures of parents who struggle to accept them. Loving and accepting children as they are provides protection from society's judgments.

## The Quiet Support Approach

**Quiet support** means treating a child's non-conforming interests the same as any other interests. When a boy wants princess dresses, unicorn coloring books, or painted nails, you provide them without making a bigger fuss than you would for traditionally "boy" interests like dinosaurs and cars.

**Example in practice**: A 5-year-old boy who loved female characters, wanted princess hair, and wore dresses was quietly supported. His parents got him princess dresses for birthdays and Christmas, let him grow his hair long, and gave him fairy and unicorn coloring books. They treated these interests as completely normal rather than as something brave or different.

**The reasoning behind not highlighting difference**: Even expressing pride about "brave" choices can backfire by implying the child is doing something unusual or different. The goal is for the child to feel that there aren't male and female toys or ways of dressing - just interests and preferences.

**What quiet support looks like at school**: When this boy wore a princess dress to a non-uniform day, the parent said nothing beforehand because the child felt fine about it. Making a fuss - even a supportive one - would have highlighted difference when the goal was normalcy.

**A key concern with quiet-support-only**: One parent raises the important point that not naming or discussing gender expectations could lead to confusion or overwhelm for the child. Children receive messages outside the home about how they're "expected" to act based on gender. Similar to how being "colorblind" isn't the same as being antiracist, not talking about something doesn't protect children from the messaging they encounter elsewhere.

## When Support Needs to Be Louder

Quiet support is sufficient when that's all that is needed - and this itself is a huge advance from what most parents experienced in their own childhoods. However, because we are following the child's lead and also responding to what happens to them, sometimes support needs to be more active and vocal.

**The trigger for louder support**: When a child ventures to explore outside of society's gender rigidity (like wearing a dress) and gets pushback, they need extra support from parents. Society is gender-rigid, so children who push against those boundaries will encounter friction.

## Practical Framework for Supporting Gender-Nonconforming Behavior

### Step 1: Empathize When They Share Experiences

When your child tells you about a negative interaction (like classmates saying "boys don't wear dresses"), start by acknowledging their feelings: "Ouch. It could hurt your feelings to have your classmates say that."

**Why this comes first**: You never want your child to suffer alone with the feeling of being marginalized. The emotional validation must precede any education or problem-solving.

### Step 2: Give Permission and Educate

After empathizing, take the opportunity to both normalize and inform:

"Anybody should be able to wear any kind of clothing. Boys can wear dresses, girls can wear pants. And some kids aren't girls or boys - they're nonbinary - and they can also wear anything they want! Being a girl, a boy, or being nonbinary has nothing to do with what kind of clothes you wear."

**Why education matters**: The concept of nonbinary is new to many children. It's important to tell ALL kids - not just those who are questioning - that some people are boys, some are girls, and some are neither (which can be called nonbinary). This normalizes the concept and gives children language to understand their own experience or the experiences of others.

### Step 3: Empower With Skills and Language

**The store analogy**: If we send a child into a store to make a purchase, we arm them with the skills and language to use. We don't assume they'll figure it out themselves or that the store clerk will necessarily be helpful. The same applies to social situations around gender expression.

**Proactive preparation** (when appropriate): Before a child wears something that might draw attention, you might want to:
- Ask if other boys wear dresses at school
- Ask how others respond when that happens
- Help them think through how they might respond if anyone criticizes them

**Calibrate to your context**: This preparation might make a child self-conscious, and there are schools where it wouldn't be necessary. You know whether your child attends such a school. If not, have a calm conversation about how great the outfit is and how some people might not understand the choice - but that's okay, it's fine to make this choice, and you support them.

### Reactive Empowerment (After Negative Experiences)

If your child comes home feeling bad about an interaction with classmates:

1. Empathize: "That must have felt bad when your classmates said that."
2. Empower for the future: "I wonder, if that happens in the future, if there is something you might say to them that might make you feel better? Should we brainstorm?"

This approach applies to any situation that makes them uncomfortable, not just gender-related ones.

## What to Avoid

**Don't make assumptions in either direction**: Don't assume a daughter who likes trains will become an engineer, and don't assume a son who likes dresses will always love them. Also don't assume the opposite - that these interests are "just a phase."

**Don't harden identity prematurely**: One parent's concern is that making too big a deal about non-conforming behavior could cause "the child to harden into an identity that might not be authentic for them." Support exploration without labeling.

**Don't treat it as braver than other choices**: Calling a boy "brave" for wearing a dress implies it's inherently different or risky, which reinforces the very gender rigidity you're trying to counter.

**Don't ignore outside influences**: Children receive gender messaging from media and peers constantly. Pretending these messages don't exist by not discussing them doesn't protect children - it may leave them confused and alone with conflicting information.

## The Bigger Picture

Many children explore clothes, toys, and play not traditionally associated with their gender. This exploration:
- Doesn't mean they will be gender nonconforming
- But also doesn't mean they won't be

The outcome doesn't change the parenting approach. All children deserve the right to explore, pursue their interests, and develop as who they are. If a child does turn out to be gender nonconforming, they especially need parental support and unconditional love.

**The protective factor**: Kids who are nonbinary and suffer mental health challenges are responding to pressures from culture and sometimes from parents who struggle with acceptance. Loving and accepting children as they are is what gives them protection from society's judgments. Trans and nonbinary kids have higher rates of suicide attempts - parental acceptance is a crucial protective factor.

## Key Distinctions

**Clothing/interests vs. gender identity**: What a child wears or plays with has nothing to do with whether they are a boy, girl, or nonbinary. The article emphasizes separating these concepts for children.

**Quiet support vs. loud support**: Both have their place. Quiet support works when the child isn't encountering pushback. Loud support becomes necessary when society's gender rigidity creates problems for the child.

**Normalizing vs. highlighting**: The goal is to normalize non-conforming interests (treating them like any other interest) rather than highlighting them as special, brave, or different - even in positive ways.

## Sample Scripts

**When child reports mean comments about wearing a dress**:
"Well, boys don't wear dresses that often so some people think that's unusual. I think clothes are just clothes. It's so much fun to dress up as Elsa!"

**Educational statement for all children**:
"Some people are boys, some are girls, some are neither, which can be called nonbinary."

**After a child shares they were hurt by classmates**:
"Ouch. It could hurt your feelings to have your classmates say that."

**Permission and education combined**:
"Anybody should be able to wear any kind of clothing. Boys can wear dresses, girls can wear pants. And some kids aren't girls or boys - they're nonbinary - and they can also wear anything they want! Being a girl, a boy, or being nonbinary has nothing to do with what kind of clothes you wear."

**Empowerment after negative experience**:
"That must have felt bad when your classmates said that. I wonder, if that happens in the future, if there is something you might say to them that might make you feel better? Should we brainstorm?"
