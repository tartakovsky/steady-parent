# Why Teenagers Lie and How to Rebuild Trust

## The Core Principle: Lying is a Safety Response

**Dr. Shefali Tsabary's insight**: "There is only one reason a child lies to its parents: the conditions for it to feel safe have not been created."

This reframes the problem entirely. Lying is not a character flaw or a sign of disrespect. It is a protective behavior that emerges when a child does not feel safe telling the truth. The implication is that to stop the lying, the parent must change the environment rather than trying to force the child to change their behavior directly.

When a teenager lies "just to go along with you" or "to get you out of her face," this signals that telling the truth has historically led to negative consequences, whether punishment, anger, lengthy lectures, or loss of autonomy. The lying becomes a rational strategy from the teenager's perspective.

## Research on Why Children Lie

**Key finding**: Many, if not most, kids lie at some point. However, children whose parents do not punish and who feel they can openly discuss their challenges generally do not lie to their parents. They have no reason to.

The causal chain is: Punishment creates fear -> Fear makes honesty dangerous -> The child learns to avoid danger through lying.

The reverse is also true: When parents create conditions where honesty is safe, children become honest because lying serves no protective function.

**Connection to self-discipline**: Children raised without external punishment develop into self-disciplined individuals. External discipline (punishment) actually interferes with the development of internal discipline. When there is no fear of punishment, the child can make choices based on their own values rather than based on avoiding consequences.

## The Initial Conversation: How to Approach It

### What to Do

1. **Sit down and express your feelings without attacking**. Tell your child how much it upsets you when they lie. The key word is "without attacking." An attack puts the child on the defensive and reinforces that honesty leads to unpleasant interactions.

2. **Focus on the relationship, not the lying itself**. Explain that you want to be close to them. When they lie, it destroys the relationship because you cannot trust them. This frames the issue as a relationship problem rather than a behavior problem. The child understands that the parent's primary concern is connection, not control.

3. **Do not argue about whether they are lying**. Getting into a debate about specific lies misses the point and creates conflict. The goal is to communicate your desire for closeness and truth, not to prove that they lied on Tuesday about X.

### When the Child Gets Defensive or Angry

The child may not admit to lying. They may get angry. This is predictable. Your job in this moment is to:

1. **Keep calm**. Do not let your buttons get pushed. If you react with anger, you confirm that honesty leads to conflict.

2. **Express sadness, not anger**. Anger feels threatening and creates more emotional distance. Sadness communicates that you are hurt but not attacking.

3. **If they start a fight, do not engage**. Repeat that it makes you sad to not have a good relationship with them because you love them.

4. **Set a boundary about communication conditions**: Tell them you cannot talk when you feel attacked, but you will be ready to talk sincerely whenever they are. Then end the conversation by getting up and leaving.

This models several things: that you can handle difficult emotions without escalating, that you have boundaries, and that the door remains open for productive conversation.

## Going Deeper: Exploring the Root Cause

If both parties can stay calm during the initial discussion, you can explore further.

### The Critical Question to Ask

Ask whether they lie because they are afraid you will lose your temper if they tell the truth. This question does two things:
- It demonstrates that you are willing to examine your own role in the problem
- It gives them permission to be honest about what is actually driving the behavior

### The Parent's Commitment

If the child says yes, they are afraid of your temper, can you commit to controlling your own temper? This is presented as a potential breakthrough. The parent making a genuine commitment to change their own behavior can unlock the child's willingness to tell the truth.

This creates a reciprocal dynamic: "I will work on my anger if you work on telling me the truth." But the parent takes the lead because, as stated later, the parent should do "more than half" of the work.

## A Framework for Handling Difficult Truths

**The "Can't Answer Truthfully" Protocol**: Propose that the child can say "Sorry, Mom, I can't answer that truthfully right now" instead of lying.

This creates a middle ground. The child is not forced to reveal information they do not want to share, but they are also not allowed to actively deceive. It acknowledges that there may be topics the teenager is not ready to discuss while preserving the principle that lying is not acceptable.

This approach respects the teenager's growing autonomy while maintaining a baseline of honesty in the relationship.

## The Role of Consequences for Adults (Age 18+)

For an 18-year-old who still lives at home, the parent can mention that if the relationship does not improve, the young adult may want to plan on moving out.

**Critical framing**: This is not presented as a punishment or threat. It is framed as a natural consequence. If the relationship is broken, living together becomes untenable.

**The parent's counter-commitment**: Alongside this, the parent must commit to doing their share, specifically described as "more than half, since you're the parent," to make the relationship better, starting now. The parent is not just setting expectations; they are actively taking responsibility for their contribution to the problem.

## Listening: The Often-Missed Step

After committing to work on the relationship, ask the child what you can do to make things better.

**The key instruction**: "Bite your tongue and listen."

This is not just a suggestion to ask for feedback. The explicit instruction to "bite your tongue" indicates that the natural parental impulse to explain, defend, or correct must be actively suppressed. The goal is to receive information, not to respond to it in the moment.

Listening creates safety. When a child shares what they need and the parent actually listens without arguing, it demonstrates that honesty will not be punished, which addresses the root cause of lying.

## What to Avoid

1. **Do not blame the child for lying while ignoring your own contribution**. The framing "It's easy to blame our child" acknowledges this is the default response but suggests it is not productive.

2. **Do not get into arguments about specific lies**. This creates conflict and misses the underlying issue.

3. **Do not react with anger when they get defensive**. This confirms that honesty is dangerous.

4. **Do not make the conversation only about what they need to change**. The parent must take responsibility for creating a better environment.

5. **Do not expect immediate admission of lying**. They may not admit it, and pushing for admission will likely backfire.

## The Bigger Picture: Punishment vs. Relationship

The entire approach rests on a fundamental belief: children raised without punishment, in an environment where they feel safe talking to their parents, become more responsible, considerate, and self-disciplined than children raised with punishment.

This is counterintuitive for many parents who believe that without punishment, children will have no reason to behave well. The research cited suggests the opposite: punishment creates the conditions for dishonesty and undermines the development of genuine self-discipline.

When a child lies, the question to ask is not "How do I stop this behavior?" but "What have I created that makes lying feel necessary?"
