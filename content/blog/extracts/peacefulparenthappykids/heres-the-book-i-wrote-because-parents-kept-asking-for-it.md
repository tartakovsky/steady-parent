## Extractable Concepts (Limited)

### Book Content Overview

The book mentioned includes three main components:

1. **Shortcuts to connect with your child** - Quick methods for building parent-child connection

2. **Games for laughing and bonding** - Specific activities designed to:
   - Get kids laughing
   - Build bonding between parent and child

3. **Emotion coaching walkthrough** - A step-by-step guide covering:
   - How to set limits with empathy
   - Supporting children to develop self-discipline
   - Supporting children to develop resilience

### Key Framework Mentioned: Setting Limits with Empathy

The phrase "set limits with empathy, in a way that supports your child to develop self-discipline and resilience" suggests a core philosophy:
- Limits and empathy are not opposites - they can coexist
- The WAY limits are set matters for child development outcomes
- Self-discipline develops through this empathic limit-setting approach (rather than through harsh discipline)
- Resilience is built through this same approach
