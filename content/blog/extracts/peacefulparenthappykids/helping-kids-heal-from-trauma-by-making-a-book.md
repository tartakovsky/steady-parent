## Core Framework: Why Book-Making Helps Trauma Processing

Making a personalized book about a traumatic event is a therapeutic intervention that can help children heal from major life events requiring adjustment. The approach works through four interconnected mechanisms.

### Mechanism 1: Emotional Expression to a Compassionate Witness

The book-making process gives the child a chance to talk about what happened and to be heard. This witnessing is essential because children need to express big emotions to someone who receives them with compassion. Many children ask to read and re-read these books over and over, and each reading often brings out more nuances or perspectives. The repeated readings are part of the healing process, not a sign of being "stuck."

### Mechanism 2: Building a Neural Bridge Between Implicit and Explicit Memory

**Implicit memory** stores traumatic events in a visceral, emotional, nonverbal form. Right now, the child's story of what happened is a muddle of upset emotions like terror and pain, mixed up with pictures in their mind of whatever they saw at the time. This fragmented storage is part of what makes trauma distressing.

**Explicit memory** is verbal and rational. "Telling the story" of what happened helps the child process the experience by building a neural connection between the implicit memory where the upsetting event is recorded and a new explicit memory that the parent helps create. This neural bridging transforms chaotic emotional fragments into an organized narrative the child can understand and manage.

### Mechanism 3: Shaping the Story's Ending to Build Resilience

How we see the ending of an event is vitally important in how we remember and process that event. Humans make sense of their experience by telling stories, so you're helping the child see their story differently by ensuring a positive resolution.

**Important caveat**: Don't try to "rewrite" the child's experience. The goal is not to deny what happened, but to make sure that at the end, after all the upset has been shared, you discuss the positives. Example framing: "Josh's body knew just what to do to heal. Josh told Mommy how scary it was to be held down for the stitches, and Mommy listened and understood and hugged him. After the stitches, the doctors took good care of Josh and he felt much better."

### Mechanism 4: Developing Self-Efficacy for Future Challenges

The child needs to see themselves as able to cope with this past event and any similar events that may happen in the future. The empowerment comes from helping them see that although they endured a difficult situation, they do have control of some parts of this. There are things they can do if they are ever in a similar situation again, and there are things they can do now to help themselves feel better about it.

## Context: Medical Trauma Specifically

The example case involves a child who suffered medical trauma and is angry at the parent because the parent held them down for stitches. This creates a complicated dynamic where the child experiences the parent as helping subject them to pain.

**Recommendation for future medical situations**: Do not hold your child down. Instead, stay in the room and talk to your child and comfort them through the experience. When medical personnel ask parents to help immobilize the child, the child then experiences the parent as complicit in causing pain, which damages trust.

**Complementary approach**: In addition to making a book, support the child to work through complicated feelings about the medical experience and the parent's role in it by using play to act out the story. The book and therapeutic play work together.

## Step-by-Step Book Construction Method

### Step 1: Choose an Appropriate Title

You don't want the medical trauma to "define" the child's life. The book should be titled something like "The Story of Josh's Operation" rather than "Josh's Life." The title scopes the trauma as one event rather than the child's identity.

### Step 2: Physical Construction (Keep It Simple)

- Use construction paper or white copy paper
- Glue on photos and write or print out captions
- Lamination is optional
- Three-hole punch and put into a notebook, or just fold and staple
- It does not have to be long or perfect
- Assume you will add and revise over time

The imperfection and iterative nature is built into the design. This is a living document, not a polished product.

### Step 3: Make It the Child's Story Through Collaboration

You can create the book yourself, but it's better to offer your child the opportunity to help you write the book by:
- Drawing pictures for it
- Giving you their own words for what happened, which you write down for them

This collaborative process helps them process their emotions about it. The child's active participation is part of the therapeutic mechanism.

### Step 4: Gather Visual Materials

**Options**: Let the child make drawings, or use photos.

**Photo sourcing**: Find any specific photos related to the trauma:
- A photo of the child with a cast on their arm
- A photo of the hospital where it happened
- A photo of an ambulance

**Narrative structure**: Start with the child's birth, which made the parents so happy. Then go fairly quickly through the child's young, happy life with photos of the high points. This establishes the baseline of a good life before arriving at: "But one day, something very scary happened..."

**Example narrative sequence**: "Josh had an accident... he was bleeding... Mommy rushed him to the hospital... the doctors had to stop the bleeding with stitches, by sewing up Josh's big cut..."

### Step 5: Listen and Reflect During Reading

As you read, listen to and reflect your child's feelings. Be aware that they could go into anger as they feel vulnerable all over again. Keep reassuring them that they are safe now, and that you wish you could have stopped all the pain before.

**If you made the initial book**: Suggest that your child make some pictures for the book. Give them the same paper and markers or crayons and let them draw or scribble. They will talk, hopefully, and you can write what they say as the caption. Add their pictures to the book.

**Critical principle**: Use everything your child says in the book.

**Example of honoring difficult emotions**: If the child says "My mommy hurt me," you can write: "Josh was so upset because Mommy hurt him while she held him to get the stitches. Mommy had to hold Josh tightly so the doctors could stitch the wound so it would stop bleeding... Josh was so scared... He was too little to understand why Mommy held him down... Mommy was crying and Josh was crying... He thought Mommy was trying to hurt him and he was so upset... Finally the doctors finished and told Josh he would be okay... but Josh was still mad and sad at the doctors and at Mommy."

**Follow-up page acknowledging relationship repair**: "Sometimes it was hard for Josh to trust Mommy after this... But Mommy loved Josh very much and she understood. She always protected him."

### Step 6: Empower Through Fantasy and Problem-Solving

Ask your child what they wish they could have said and done at the time.

**Fantasy is acceptable**: Even fantasizing about becoming a super hero in that moment and destroying the ER is an okay response. The child needs to start to see themselves as able to handle situations like this.

**Evolution over time**: As you talk over time, they might start to say things like "I could breathe and calm myself down... I could ask for medicine so the stitches would not hurt and no one would have to hold me down." This represents a shift from powerless victim to someone with coping strategies.

### Step 7: Ensure a Happy Ending

End your story with something happy:
- A photo of you and your son hugging
- One of the whole family

**Content elements for the ending**:
- State that the child is all well now, their body has healed
- Acknowledge that sometimes they still feel sad when they think about the accident
- Show them a path to deal with those feelings: they know they can talk to Mommy and she will always understand
- Include forward movement: every day they feel better

**Why this works**: It's important to acknowledge that the child still has lingering feelings while showing them a path to deal with those feelings. The story must have a happy ending because that shapes how the memory consolidates.

### Step 8: Expect and Welcome Big Feelings

Be aware that your son will have big feelings during and after reading this book. Let them vent and rage and cry, and stay compassionate. They need to get all that out of their system to complete their healing.

The big feelings are not a sign that the book is making things worse. They are the healing process itself. The parent's job is to remain a compassionate witness through these emotional expressions.

## Key Principles Embedded in the Method

### Don't Rewrite Reality, Reframe the Ending

The method explicitly warns against trying to rewrite what happened. The child's experience was real and painful. What changes is the conclusion of the story and the child's relationship to it, not the facts of what occurred.

### The Child's Words Go In Exactly As Spoken

When the child expresses difficult things like "My mommy hurt me," those exact words go into the book. The parent then adds context around those words, but the child's experience is validated first.

### Iterative Process Over Time

The assumption that you will "add and revise" indicates this is not a one-time intervention but an ongoing tool. Multiple readings with evolving content are part of the design.

### Safety Reassurance Is Continuous

"Keep reassuring him that he is safe now" appears as ongoing action during reading, not just at the end. The safety message is repeated throughout the process.

### The Parent's Own Emotions Are Part of the Story

The example includes "Mommy was crying and Josh was crying" - the parent's distress is acknowledged in the narrative. This validates that the experience was hard for everyone and that the parent was not coldly complicit.
