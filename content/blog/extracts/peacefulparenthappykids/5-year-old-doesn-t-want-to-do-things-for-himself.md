# When a Child Resists Doing Things for Themselves

## Core Diagnostic Framework

When a child who is capable of doing things independently prefers that a parent do it for them, the first step is **diagnosis, not intervention**. The question to ask is: What is dampening their natural pleasure in discovery and mastery?

Children inherently enjoy mastering things. When this drive appears diminished, something is interfering with it. The resistance is a symptom, not the core problem.

### Two Primary Root Causes

**1. Perfectionism / Fear of Failure**

The child believes they must do it perfectly. Signs include:
- Getting frustrated when they can't do something right away
- Saying things like "I can't do it" or "I do it wrong" or "It gets stuck"
- Giving up quickly on tasks that require practice

**2. Fear of Growing Up / Loss of Connection**

The child worries that becoming more independent means losing parental care and connection. Signs include:
- Expressing wishes not to grow up
- Fears about having to give up comfort objects (like a stuffed animal) when older
- Wanting parent to do tasks the child can already do, particularly caregiving-type tasks (zipping coat, pouring cereal)

These causes are not mutually exclusive. A child can experience both simultaneously, which requires addressing each appropriately depending on the moment.

## Response Strategy for Fear of Lost Connection

### The Core Principle: Abundance of Care First

If the child fears that independence means less caretaking, the solution is to provide more than enough caretaking so they feel secure. When children feel they have abundant care and connection, they become more willing to initiate independent actions.

### The Specific Approach

When the child says "I can't do it... you do it for me":

1. **Do it for them lovingly** - not grudgingly or with frustration
2. **Affirm your willingness to help** with words like: "I am ALWAYS happy to help you when you need it"
3. **Express confidence in their eventual readiness** without pressure: "I know when you are ready, you'll want to try zipping it yourself"

This approach communicates:
- Your care is unconditional and not contingent on their independence
- You trust their developmental timeline
- Independence is something they will choose when ready, not something being forced on them

The phrase "when you are ready" is key - it removes pressure and places agency with the child.

## Response Strategy for Perfectionism

### The Diagnostic Moment

After offering help lovingly, pay attention to how the child responds. If they explain their resistance with statements about inability or failure ("I can't do it... I do it wrong... It gets stuck"), this reveals perfectionism as the root cause.

### The Collaborative Approach

Instead of either doing it for them entirely or insisting they do it alone, **work together** on the task. This teaches multiple lessons simultaneously.

**Example: Helping with a zipper**

Parent says: "Zippers are hard... Let's work together."

Then break the task into small collaborative steps:
- "Here, you hold this piece"
- "I'll slip this piece in here"
- "Now, can you grab that pull and pull it up?"
- "Hey, it's going!"
- "Let me help you pull it straight so it doesn't get stuck"

### What This Collaboration Teaches

1. **Normalization of difficulty**: "Zippers are hard" validates that the struggle is expected, not a sign of incompetence
2. **Learning is a process**: By working through it together step by step, the child sees that mastery develops gradually
3. **Help is available**: The child learns they don't have to figure everything out alone
4. **Mistakes are acceptable**: The collaborative approach makes errors part of the process rather than failures
5. **Incremental success**: Small wins within the larger task build confidence

## Underlying Principles

### Why "Doting and Coddling" Works

The suggestion to "dote on him and cuddle and coddle" is counterintuitive - it might seem like this would increase dependence. However, the logic is:

- Children who feel insecure about receiving care cling to it
- Children who feel confident they have abundant care are free to explore independence
- The path to independence runs through security, not deprivation of care

### The Difference Between Doing For vs. Doing With

- **Doing for** (with loving reassurance): Appropriate when the child needs connection and security
- **Doing with** (collaboration): Appropriate when the child needs to learn that mistakes are okay and skills develop over time

The same task (zipping a coat) requires different responses depending on what the child needs in that moment.

### Pressure-Free Language

Notice what is NOT said:
- "You're a big boy now"
- "You should be able to do this"
- "Come on, just try"
- "You did it yesterday"

All statements about the child's readiness come as expressions of confidence in their timeline: "I know when you are ready, you'll want to try." This removes performance pressure while still communicating expectation of eventual mastery.

## Practical Application

When facing a child who resists doing things independently:

1. **First, diagnose**: Is this about perfectionism, fear of lost connection, or both?
2. **If connection fears**: Provide abundant care and loving help without conditions or pressure
3. **If perfectionism**: Collaborate on the task, normalizing difficulty and breaking it into manageable steps
4. **If both**: Combine approaches based on what the moment calls for
5. **Throughout**: Use language that affirms your willingness to help AND your confidence in their eventual readiness

## Key Insight

The goal is not to make the child do things independently through encouragement or pressure. The goal is to remove the barriers (fear of failure, fear of lost connection) that are suppressing their natural drive toward mastery. When those barriers are addressed, the desire to do things themselves emerges naturally.
