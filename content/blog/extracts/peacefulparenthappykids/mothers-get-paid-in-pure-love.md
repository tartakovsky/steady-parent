## The Nature of Parental Commitment

Parents who actively seek to improve their parenting are demonstrating exceptional qualities. The willingness to grow and change oneself for a child's well-being requires **commitment**, **courage**, and **love**. This self-improvement orientation distinguishes dedicated parents from those who simply parent on autopilot.

Parenting is described as "the toughest work on the planet" - a framing that validates the difficulty while honoring those who undertake it seriously.

## The Invisibility of Parental Sacrifice

A core emotional truth for parents is that much of their work goes unrecognized:

- Children have no awareness of how much sacrifice parenting requires
- Parents don't receive the recognition they deserve
- Much of parenting work seems invisible to the outside world

Despite this lack of recognition, **every act of love has a ripple effect** and contributes to making the world better. Parenting is framed as "extreme love in action" - an intense, ongoing expression of love through daily choices and sacrifices.

## Winnicott's "Ordinary Devotion" - Reframed

**D.W. Winnicott**, the famous psychiatrist and pediatrician, introduced the concept that children don't need perfection from parents. According to Winnicott, parents need only:
1. Avoid harming their children
2. Offer them "ordinary devotion"

However, the article argues that **there is nothing ordinary about parental devotion**. The word "ordinary" undersells what devotion actually requires in practice.

### What Devotion Actually Looks Like

Devotion manifests in concrete daily actions that require significant self-regulation and sacrifice:

- **Walking the floor at 2am** holding a screaming baby with an ear infection
- **Taking a deep breath and re-centering yourself** when any reasonable person would scream - this highlights the emotional labor of self-regulation during stress
- **Forcing yourself into the kitchen** to make dinner after a long day when you just want to collapse on the couch - pushing through exhaustion for your child's needs
- **Biting your tongue so often you get a piercing** - a vivid metaphor for the constant restraint required to respond thoughtfully rather than reactively
- **Taking off your jacket on a freezing night** to tuck around a sleeping child in the back seat - putting your child's comfort above your own physical needs

### The Spectrum of Devotion

The same "ordinary devotion" expressed in these daily moments is the same intense love that has driven parents throughout human history to **physically place themselves between their child and danger**. Examples given span from immediate physical threats to extreme historical dangers:

- Flying glass
- Snarling wolves
- Enemy soldiers

This connects everyday parenting sacrifices (making dinner when exhausted) to heroic protective instincts - they come from the same source of love.

## The Reward Structure of Parenting

Despite the lack of external recognition, there is a meaningful "payment" for parenting: **pure love**. This reframes the parent-child relationship as one where the emotional connection and love received from children is the compensation for all the invisible sacrifice.

## Daily Validation Principle

The closing message suggests a mindset shift: rather than waiting for designated days like Mother's Day or Father's Day for recognition, parents should remember that **every day is their day**. This encourages ongoing self-appreciation rather than annual acknowledgment.
