## Core Principle: Weaning Is Not Required for Returning to Work

The central insight is that the mother's goal is not actually weaning, but rather helping the child accept nourishment in forms other than nursing. These are distinct goals. Weaning means ending breastfeeding entirely, while the actual need is simply for the child to eat or drink something while mom is away. This reframe changes the entire approach because it reduces the pressure on both mother and child.

## Understanding Why Some 12-Month-Olds Refuse Solid Food

Many children at this age do not eat much solid food when breastfeeding remains available. This is a common and normal pattern, not a failure or problem with the child. The nursing provides both nutrition and comfort, which the child naturally prefers over solid alternatives. Understanding this normalizes the situation and reduces parental anxiety about the child's eating behavior.

## The Child Will Not Starve: A Key Reassurance

**A one-year-old will not starve herself.** This is a critical reassurance for anxious parents facing this transition. The biological drive to eat is strong enough that when the child is hungry and nursing is not available, she will eventually accept other forms of nourishment. The anxiety parents feel about cups and bottles being rejected is understandable, but the child's survival instincts will prevail during the mother's absence.

## Practical Recommendation: Nuby Sippy Cup

**The Nuby sippy cup** is specifically recommended as many mothers report their babies find it more satisfying to suck on than other options. The reasoning is that it may better approximate the nursing experience, making it more acceptable to a baby who strongly prefers breastfeeding. This is a concrete, actionable product suggestion rather than a general "try different cups" recommendation.

## Anticipating the Adjustment: Marathon Nursing at Night

**Expect increased nighttime nursing** once the mother returns to work. This serves two purposes:

1. **Nourishment**: The child may compensate for daytime caloric intake by nursing more at night
2. **Bonding and connection**: One-year-olds need their mothers, and when separated all day, they miss their mothers intensely. Nursing becomes a way to reconnect and receive comfort

This increased nighttime nursing is a normal adaptation to the new circumstances, not a regression or problem behavior.

## Why Not to Wean During This Transition

The temptation to wean completely is understandable because it might seem simpler to eliminate the nursing variable entirely. However, this recommendation argues against weaning during the return-to-work transition for several important reasons:

- **Nursing provides comfort during adjustment**: The child is facing a major life change (mom being gone all day), and nursing helps her cope with this emotional challenge
- **Nursing supports bonding**: The nursing relationship allows for reconnection after separation
- **Patience now helps the child through the big adjustment**: Rather than removing both mom's daytime presence AND the nursing relationship simultaneously, maintaining nursing preserves one source of stability and comfort

The key insight is that weaning during this period would compound the child's losses, making the adjustment harder rather than easier.

## The Emotional Reality for One-Year-Olds

The article explicitly names that **one-year-olds need their mothers** and **when we're gone all day, they miss us terribly**. This is not stated as a guilt-inducing fact but as context for understanding the child's behavior and needs. The increased nursing is reframed as the child's healthy adaptation to a challenging situation rather than a problematic behavior to be eliminated.

## Summary of Recommended Approach

1. Reframe the goal from weaning to accepting alternative nourishment
2. Trust that the child will eat when hungry enough during mother's absence
3. Try the Nuby sippy cup as a potentially more satisfying option
4. Accept and accommodate increased nighttime nursing as normal adaptation
5. Maintain breastfeeding as a comfort source during the transition
6. Be patient with the adjustment period rather than trying to accelerate weaning
