# Breastfeeding vs. Bottle Feeding: Complete Guide

## Core Position: Breast is Better, But Not Everything

Research shows unequivocally that **breastfed babies are healthier and smarter**, and the longer babies are nursed, the greater these benefits become. This happens because brain development, immune function, and all aspects of the baby's physiology are designed to flourish when fed their natural food. Substitute food, no matter how well-designed, cannot exactly match what the human body creates.

The benefits extend beyond physical health. Nursing mothers experience **hormonal changes that influence how they perceive and relate to their infant**. Many experts believe that the mother who nurses bonds more strongly with her baby, resulting in a better relationship over time.

However, if you cannot breastfeed, this is not cause for panic. Babies who aren't fed breastmilk can still be emotionally and physically healthy. **The most important emotional factor is the responsiveness of the parent to the infant**, not the feeding method. Infant formula has also made great advances in the past two decades, moving closer to breast milk in composition.

## The 11 Keys to Successful Breastfeeding

### 1. Plan to Nurse with Commitment

The mindset matters enormously. Not "if it works out" but "I will do this." This commitment approach is backed by historical evidence: during World War 2 in London, when infant formula wasn't available, records show that every mother who gave birth during that time was able to breastfeed successfully, because there was no alternative. When breastfeeding is framed as the only option rather than one option among many, success rates are dramatically higher.

### 2. Be Prepared with Proper Equipment

**The classic nursing hold:**
- Cradle your baby's head in the crook of your arm
- Turn her whole body to face you so you're belly to belly
- Move her to your breast so she can "latch on"
- She needs to be at the level of your breast, which means on a pillow, not on your lap

**The nursing pillow is essential.** A good nursing pillow with a circular cut-out for your belly is hugely better than an ordinary pillow, which slides around and isn't necessarily the right height or firmness. While many baby products are unnecessary (the author didn't use changing tables, cribs, or strollers in the early months), a nursing pillow is a smart purchase.

### 3. Master the Technique

Good basic technique can tremendously lessen sore nipples, prevent clogged ducts and mastitis, and make the difference in whether breastfeeding works or not.

**Latch-on technique:**
- Ensure your baby opens his mouth wide and gets not only the nipple but most of the areola in
- This stimulates the full milk let-down AND prevents sore nipples (both benefits from the same technique)
- If the baby won't open wide enough, trigger the **"rooting reflex"** by tickling his mouth or cheek with your nipple

**Position checks:**
- Baby should be facing you so he doesn't have to turn his head to nurse
- Baby should be at breast level so you don't have to hunch over (this allows you to relax better, ensuring better milk let-down, and prevents sore back and neck)
- The tongue should be slightly visible between his lower lip and your breast
- If tongue isn't visible, disengage, tickle his cheek to get him to open wide, and let him latch on again

**Protecting your nipples:**
- To disengage, insert your finger at the side of his mouth and break the suction so he pops off
- Usually the baby will fall asleep nursing and the breast will fall out of his slack mouth, which is also fine

**Preventing clogged ducts:**
- Change holds and rotate the baby's position from feeding to feeding
- This better drains the breasts, avoids clogged ducts, and protects nipples from soreness
- Example holds: the **football hold** (baby's feet pointing behind you, hold his head in your hand) or nursing lying down (prop yourself well with pillows, and if necessary put a folded blanket under baby so neither of you strains)

**Self-care essentials:**
- Drink LOTS of water, constantly
- Change your bra daily so any leaked milk (even tiny amounts) doesn't cause a breast infection
- Wait to introduce a pacifier or bottle until nursing is well-established

### 4. Get a Good Start with Professional Support

We don't grow up watching moms and aunts nurse their babies, and it isn't second nature to us. Getting started nursing is sometimes harder than expected. Common early challenges:
- Unbearably sore nipples in the very beginning
- Baby having a hard time latching on
- Occasional physical challenges (such as being **tongue-tied**, which requires a quick snip under the tongue by a doctor)

**Arrange lactation support while pregnant for that first week.** Call your local La Leche chapter in advance just to have a couple of breastfeeding consultants' names handy. Such an expert often makes all the difference in the world. It is absolutely not worth the anxiety of muddling through when one session with an expert can put you and your baby on track.

### 5. Cultivate Family Support

Make sure your partner understands your reasons for choosing to breastfeed. A little education goes a long way to overcome prejudices. Most men, with their wife's encouragement, find breastfeeding a miraculous act, especially once they understand how important it is for their baby. **Your partner's support will be critical to your success.**

### 6. Pick a Pediatrician Who Supports Breastfeeding

Virtually all new breastfeeders worry about whether their child is getting enough milk. Most pediatricians are nursing advocates. Get him or her to help you as much as possible. Having professional medical support who shares your goals eliminates doubt and provides reassurance when worries arise.

### 7. Remember the Advantages to You

**Practical benefits:**
- No middle of the night fixing of bottles
- No sterilizing of bottles
- No formula expenses
- No formula allergies

**Physical benefits:**
- As much ice cream as you want to eat, while the pregnancy pounds melt away
- Diminished chance of breast cancer later
- A delay in how soon your period resumes

**Emotional benefits:**
- Pride in the amazing ability of your womanly body

### 8. Find Other Moms Who Are Breastfeeding

Connect through La Leche or other groups. It makes all the difference in the world. Social support and normalization of breastfeeding counteracts cultural pressures that might otherwise undermine your commitment.

### 9. Resist the Impulse to Supplement with Formula

**Critical principle: Supplementing with formula, even in an attempt to ensure your baby gets enough, ALWAYS decreases your milk supply.** This is because breast milk production operates on supply and demand.

If you want your baby to take a bottle:
- Pump your milk and have your partner offer it in a bottle once nursing is well established
- Don't wait too long or your baby may refuse this "fakery"

If your baby needs more food: **Feed her more often.** The answer to too little milk is always to increase the demand by more nursing and/or pumping, not to add formula.

### 10. Take a Six-Month Maternity Leave If Possible

When you return to work at six months, your child will be ready to supplement his morning and evening feedings with solid food during the day. This timing allows breastfeeding to be well-established before the challenge of work separation.

### 11. Relax, Enjoy, and Don't Be in a Hurry to Wean

The reassurance: She won't be nursing in high school. There's no need to rush the weaning process.

## When to Wean: Evidence and Recommendations

Many studies confirm that **breast milk changes in nutritional value to remain appropriate for babies as they grow into toddlers**, maintaining its many health benefits throughout.

**Official recommendations:**
- The National Association of Pediatricians recommends breastfeeding at least until age one, preferably longer
- The average age of weaning around the world is four years old

**Practical guidance:** Plan to nurse for at least a year, maybe two or three. The author nursed both her kids until they were three, and was back at work in both cases well before they weaned, but not for the first six months.

## Why Most Mothers Wean Early: Cultural and Structural Barriers

### Cultural Pressures

If no one around you is nursing a baby, it may be hard to envision yourself nursing. When your own husband, or even complete strangers, begin to chastise you for nursing an eleven-month-old who is learning to walk, you will probably begin to feel uncomfortable nursing, especially if you don't have support to continue.

### The Work Problem

**For most mothers, even those convinced of the benefits of nursing, going back to work means the beginning of the end of breastfeeding.**

The structural problem in the US:
- Most maternity leaves in this country are disgracefully short, averaging 6 weeks at 2/3 pay
- This compares to an average of a year at full pay in most European countries
- Fully half of all American women are not entitled to ANY paid maternity leave

## Strategies for Working Mothers

If you must return to work:

1. **Wait as long as you can** so breastfeeding is well-established
2. **By six months**, your baby can supplement with solid food while you're gone
3. **Remember the supply-demand principle:** Any reduction in demand will reduce your supply
4. **Nurse her as much as you can when you're together**
5. **Pump at work** to maintain supply

The underlying principle: The more you can maintain demand (through both nursing when together and pumping when apart), the longer you can sustain breastfeeding despite returning to work.
