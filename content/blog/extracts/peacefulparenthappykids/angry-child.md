## The Nature of Anger in Children

### Why Humans Get Angry

**Anger is the body's "fight" response**, designed to keep us safe when we feel threatened. When someone crosses our boundaries, we get angry. This is the primary protective function.

But humans don't only get angry in response to actual external threats. There are three main triggers:

1. **Past trauma echoes**: When something happens today that reminds us of a past upset, we get angry to protect ourselves - even if today's situation isn't really much of a threat. This explains why a three-year-old's defiance can trigger parental rage - it's activating something from the parent's past.

2. **Defense against vulnerable feelings**: We get angry to fend off upsetting feelings. When our own fear, hurt, disappointment, pain, or grief scares us, we tend to lash out. The anger doesn't get rid of the hurt, but it makes us feel less powerless and temporarily numbs the pain. This is why anger is part of the grieving process.

3. **External boundary violations**: When someone actually trespasses against our boundaries.

The core insight: **Humans mobilize against any perceived threat (including their own upset feelings) by attacking.**

### Why Children Are More Prone to Anger Outbursts

Children face additional challenges with anger:

- **Lack of context**: Kids don't have a context for their upsets, so a small disappointment can seem like the end of the world
- **Underdeveloped brain**: They don't have a fully developed frontal cortex to help them self-regulate, making them even more prone to lashing out when angry
- **Irony worth noting**: We expect children to handle anger constructively when adults often fail at this themselves

### What Children Want to Attack When Angry

Most of the time when kids get angry, they want to attack:
- Their little brother (who broke their treasured memento)
- Their parents (who disciplined them "unfairly")
- Their teacher (who embarrassed them)
- The playground bully (who scared them)

The key observation: Attacking only makes sense when there's actually a threat, and that's rare. Most childhood anger situations don't involve real threats.

## What "Constructive" Anger Management Looks Like

There are three progressive stages of healthy anger management:

### Stage 1: Controlling Aggressive Impulses

When parents accept and empathize with the child's emotions, the child learns that **emotions aren't dangerous and can be felt without necessarily being acted on**.

The mechanism: As parents accept the child's anger and remain calm, the child lays down neural pathways and learns the emotional skills to:
- Calm herself down
- Communicate how she feels
- Avoid hurting people or property

**Developmental milestone**: By kindergarten age, kids should be able to tolerate the flush of adrenaline and other "fight" chemicals in the body without acting on them by clobbering a playmate.

**Important exception**: It's not unusual for kindergartners to still hit siblings - this is developmentally normal even when they can control themselves with peers.

### Stage 2: Acknowledging Anger and the Feelings Underneath

If parents can keep from getting triggered and acknowledge why the child is upset, the anger begins to calm. This helps the child feel safe enough to feel the more vulnerable emotions driving the anger.

**The healing sequence**:
1. Child feels acknowledged and safe
2. Child can let himself experience the underlying emotion (grief over the broken treasure, hurt that mother was unfair, shame when he didn't know the answer in class, fear when his classmate threatened him)
3. Those vulnerable feelings begin to heal
4. Since the vulnerable feelings fade, the child no longer needs anger to defend against them
5. The anger vanishes

**What happens without this process**: If parents don't help kids feel safe enough to feel underlying emotions, kids will just keep losing their tempers because they don't have any other way to cope with the upsets inside them. These kids often seem to have "a chip on their shoulder" because they carry around resentments and a feeling that life is against them. They're always ready to get angry.

### Stage 3: Constructive Problem-Solving

The ultimate goal is for the child to use anger as an impetus to change things so the situation won't be repeated. This includes:

- Moving treasures out of little brother's reach
- Getting parental help to deal with the bully
- Acknowledging his own contribution to the problem (resolving to follow parents' rules better, or coming to class more prepared)

**Skills developed at this stage**:
- Calming himself when angry so he can express needs without attacking
- Seeing the other person's side of the issue
- Looking for win/win solutions rather than assuming he's right and the other person is wrong

**Timeline**: It takes years of parental guidance for kids to learn these skills. If parents help kids feel safe enough to express anger and explore feelings underneath, kids become increasingly able to control outbursts and move into constructive problem-solving during the grade-school years.

## The Ten Practical Tips

### Tip 1: Start With Yourself

**Core principle**: Your calm is the foundation of everything else.

You're probably good at staying calm when things are going well. The heroic effort is staying calm when things get turbulent.

**Why yelling at an angry child backfires**: Yelling reinforces what the child is already feeling - that she is in danger. A child who is lashing out is a child who is feeling threatened and defensive. Even if you don't see why she would think she's in danger after she just socked her little brother, from her perspective she is under threat. Your anger will only make the storm worse.

**The modeling effect**: If you're in the habit of shouting at your kids, you are modeling behavior that your child will certainly copy. If you give in to the temptation to yell, you can't expect your child to learn to control himself.

What children learn from watching parents: How to handle disagreements and conflict.

### Tip 2: Get Good at De-escalating

**Your job when your child is angry is always to restore calm** because kids can only learn and understand how to "do better" when they're calm.

**The neurological mechanism**: Your calm presence, even when he's mad, helps your child feel safe. This is what helps him develop the neural pathways in the brain that shut off the "fight or flight" response and allow the frontal cortex (the "reasoning brain") to take over.

### Tip 3: Remember That All Feelings Are Allowed

**Key insight from Carl Rogers**: "The truth about rage is that it only dissolves when it is really heard and understood, without reservation."

When humans are angry, they don't calm down until they feel heard. So when your child expresses anger, the best thing you can do is listen and acknowledge how upset he is and why.

**Critical distinction**: You don't have to agree with his reasons to recognize that he's angry and has a right to be.

**What NOT to do in the moment**: Don't tell your child to calm down or act appropriate. That just makes the child escalate in an attempt to get you to hear.

**What TO do instead**: Open the door to communication. Example script: "You must be so mad to speak to me that way. I want to hear about this. Can you tell me so I can hear, without yelling at me?"

**The follow-up conversation** (after the child calms down): Talk about appropriate tone or language. Example: "You were so angry earlier, that you yelled at me. I always want to hear when you're upset, and I will always try to help. You never need to yell at me to get me to listen. Right?"

Outcome: Usually at this point, since the child feels heard, they will spontaneously apologize.

**Why this doesn't encourage bad behavior**: All emotions are acceptable; only actions need to be limited. When you ask kids to "stuff" their emotions, those feelings are no longer under conscious control. So they pop out unregulated, making it more likely the child will have a short fuse.

**The progression when feelings are allowed**:
1. The child can accept the emotions instead of trying to repress them
2. This gives cognitive control over the feelings
3. The child can start putting feelings into words instead of hitting
4. Over time, verbal expression becomes more modulated and appropriate

### Tip 4: Give Your Child Ways to Manage Angry Impulses in the Moment

Kids need skills to manage their anger in the moment.

**How to create a "MAD list"**:
1. When your child is calm, make a list together of constructive ways to handle emotion
2. Let the child do the writing or add pictures so he feels ownership
3. Post the list on the refrigerator
4. Model using it yourself when you're mad. Example: "I'm getting annoyed, so I'm checking our MAD list. Oh, I think I'll put on some music and dance out my frustration!"

**Specific techniques for the list**:

1. **PAUSE button breathing**: Breathe in for four counts through the nose, then out for eight through the mouth

2. **Squishy balls**: Keep two available. Hand the child one and demonstrate working out annoyance on it

3. **Angry dance**: Put on music and dance out the anger

4. **Arm-crossing to prevent hitting**: Kids can clap their arms around their bodies (each hand ends up on the opposite shoulder or side) and yell something like "Mom!" or "Stop!"

5. **Stomping feet**: Young children often find this helpful. Don't worry about it - it's better than kicking their sister or the wall, and over time they will start using words

6. **Draw/write and destroy** (for older children): Draw or write on paper what they're angry about, then fiercely rip it into tiny pieces

**Important clarification about physical expression**: What's healing isn't acting out the aggression, which can actually make the person more angry because it signals that there's an emergency. The body may benefit from discharging tension, but that could happen from dancing.

**What's really helpful**: The child gets to show you just how upset he is, so he feels understood.

**Script when child wants to clobber something** (in lieu of acting out toward a person): "You are showing me just how mad you are about this! I see! Wow!"

### Tip 5: Help Your Child Be Aware of Warning Signs

**Why early intervention matters**: Once kids are in the full flush of adrenaline and the other "fight or flight" neurotransmitters, they think it's an emergency and they're fighting for their lives. At that point:
- Managing angry impulses is almost impossible
- It's very hard to reach them
- All you can offer is a safe haven while the storm sweeps through them

**The better approach**: If you help your child notice when she's getting annoyed and learn to calm herself, she'll have many fewer tantrums.

**Age-appropriate strategies**:

For younger children: You'll have to know her cues and take preventive action - offering snuggle time, or getting her out of the grocery store

For older children: Point it out to her with scripts like:
- "Sweetie, you're getting upset. We can make this better. Let's all take a deep breath and figure this out together."
- "I know this is hard. And you can handle this. I'm here to help."

### Tip 6: Set Limits on Aggression

**The balance**: Allowing feelings does not mean allowing destructive actions.

**Hard rule**: Kids should never be allowed to hit others, including their parents.

**Understanding what hitting means**: When kids hit, they are always asking for limits and help containing their anger.

**Script**: "You can be as mad as you want but no hitting. I will keep us all safe. You can tell me how mad you are without hurting me."

**When children need physical struggle**: Some children really need to struggle against something when they're angry. It's fine to let them struggle against your hands, or even your holding arms if that's what they want. Safety notes: Take off your glasses and don't let yourself get hurt.

**Don't let kids break things in their fury**: This adds to their guilt and sense that they're a bad person.

**Your role**: Serve as a safe "container" while you witness your child's upsets.

### Tip 7: Don't Send a Child Away to "Calm Down" by Herself

**Goal when your child is angry or upset**: Restore a sense of safety, which requires your calm presence.

**Key principle**: Kids need your love most when they "deserve it least."

**Problem with "time out"**: It gives kids the message that they're all alone with these big, scary feelings.

**Alternative - "time in"**: Stay with your child and help him move through his feelings.

**What to say** (you don't have to say much):
- "I'm right here..."
- "You're safe..."
- "I'm listening."

**Result**: You'll be amazed at how your child begins to show more self control when you adopt this practice, because he feels less helpless and alone.

### Tip 8: Restore Connection

Your child needs to know that you understand and are there to help.

**If you know what's going on**, acknowledge it:
- "You are so angry that your tower fell."

**If you don't know**, say what you see:
- "You are crying so hard... I see how upset you are."

**Give explicit permission**:
- "It's ok, everyone needs to cry (or gets mad, or feels very sad) sometimes. I will stay right here while you show me your sads and mads."

**Physical touch**: If you can touch your child, do so to maintain connection:
- "Here's my hand on your back. You're safe. I'm here."

**If the child yells at you to go away**:
- "I hear you saying for me to go away so I am moving away, over here. I won't leave you all alone with these big feelings. I will be right over here when you are ready for a hug."

### Tip 9: Do Preventive Maintenance

Every parent needs to develop "emotion-coaching" habits that help the child feel safe and connected, and help her work through emotional challenges encountered daily.

**The six preventive practices**:

1. **Empathy**: Respond to everything the child expresses with empathy and respect, even when you set limits. (You won't be able to be empathic 24/7. Just work on increasing your ratio.)

2. **Special Time**: Spend a minimum of 15 minutes one-on-one with each child daily, just connecting and enjoying the child.

3. **Routines**: So your child knows what to expect, which helps kids feel safer.

4. **Accept all Emotions**: Whatever your child expresses, and make it safe for him to cry when he needs to.

5. **Snuggle Time**: Every morning, night, and when needed in between, to increase your child's feeling of safety.

6. **Roughhousing and Laughter**: Make sure each child gets a daily chance to belly-laugh for at least 10 minutes, preferably by being physically active with him.

### Tip 10: Help Your Child Develop Emotional Intelligence

Kids who are comfortable with their feelings are more able to manage their anger constructively.

**Why some kids don't feel safe expressing uncomfortable feelings**:
- Sometimes parents haven't allowed them to cry, so they get angry instead
- Sometimes they have parents who discount or ridicule their fears or disappointments
- Sometimes they've been sent to their rooms to "calm down" and never received the help they needed to handle their upsets
- Sometimes the pain or grief just feels too overwhelming

**The pattern that emerges**: These children try hard to repress their fears, jealousies, and anxieties, but repressed feelings pop out unmodulated. Example: An otherwise loving preschooler suddenly hits the baby.

**The cycle**: These kids live in fear of their feelings. To fend off this reservoir of fear, grief, or other pain, they get angry - and they stay angry. When this happens, a child may benefit from professional help.

## Ten Warning Signs That a Child Needs Professional Help

1. She can't control her aggressive impulses and hits people (other than siblings) past the age of six

2. Frequent explosive outbursts, indicating he is carrying a full "tank" of anger and other upsets that's always ready to spill over

3. She is constantly reflexively oppositional (and she isn't two years old)

4. He doesn't acknowledge his role in creating situations, instead feeling constantly victimized and "picked on"

5. She frequently loses friends, alienates adults, or is otherwise embroiled in interpersonal conflict

6. He seems preoccupied with revenge

7. She threatens to hurt herself physically (or actually does so)

8. He damages property regularly

9. She repeatedly expresses hatred toward herself or someone else

10. He hurts animals or smaller children who are not siblings

## Understanding the "Anger Management Issues" Pattern

When a child has "anger management issues," it means he is terrified of those pent-up feelings under the anger (fear, hurt, grief).

**The defensive mechanism**: To defend against those vulnerable feelings that he thinks will destroy him, he hardens his heart and clings to the anger as a defense. That's when kids develop a chip on their shoulder.

**The paradox**: They seem to be trying to drive you away, but it's really a cry for help.

## Approach to Getting Professional Help

**First step**: Begin by using the ideas in this article to support your child. Start talking about emotions in your home.

**Timeline**: If things aren't changing after a few months of good effort, don't hesitate to seek professional help.

**What a therapist can do**: An experienced therapist can help the child work through those deeper feelings and develop more ability to manage emotions.

**Recommended approach**: Parents should go into counseling along with their child. Reasons:
- You don't want your child to feel that he's broken so you're taking him to get "fixed"
- You want everyone in the family to learn how to communicate better, so everyone feels loved and gets their needs met
- A good therapist who meets with you and your child together can help you do that
