## The Biology of Mild Shame and Its Purpose

**Mild shame** is a biological response that serves an important developmental function. It helps children learn to rein in their impulses so they can stay safe, live well with others, and attain their goals. Dan Siegel calls this the **prefrontal cortex clutch** because it allows a person to shift gears from pursuing something they want to redirecting themselves toward something they want more. For example, a child might want to make noise in church, but they want even more not to disappoint their parent or be stared at. All children need to develop this internal ability to self-regulate.

You can experience mild shame directly through a simple exercise:

- Say "YES" aloud several times. Most people feel a smile, excitement, happiness, and a tingly sensation.
- Say "NO" aloud several times. The smile dies. The body feels tight, contracted, trapped. There is a sense of dread. People whose parents were punitive often also feel anger during this exercise.

This mild discomfort is nature's way of helping us redirect ourselves. It is not inherently harmful. The problem arises when mild shame becomes **toxic shame** through punishment and criticism.

## How Children Develop the Internal Clutch

The internal clutch that allows gear-shifting is **neural wiring** that requires repeated experience in the brain to develop. Every time a parent sets an **empathic limit** that the child decides to follow, the parent is helping the child practice using this clutch.

**Example of empathic limit-setting:**

Parent says: "You love climbing! But the TV cabinet's not safe for climbing. Let's go outside where you can climb safely."

What the child learns from this approach:
- His impulse to climb is fine and acceptable
- Climbing onto the TV cabinet specifically isn't safe
- Climbing outside is fine
- His parents can be relied on to guide him
- His parents help him switch gears

The child then turns and climbs into the parent's arms. This is probably not the first time the child has heard this redirection, which means it takes great patience from the parent to calmly connect and then redirect, again and again. But eventually, the child hears the parent's voice in his head as he begins climbing, and he stops himself. This is the beginning of conscience. It is also the beginning of self-discipline.

## How Shaming Undermines Self-Regulation

**Contrast: The shaming approach to the same climbing situation:**

Parent says: "You know better than to climb on that! You naughty boy! Can't you stop giving me trouble for one minute?"

What the child learns from this approach:
- He is naughty and bad
- He is a source of trouble for his parents
- The things he wants to do are bad
- Exploring is bad
- Climbing is bad
- He should be different than he is
- He is not good enough the way he is

The child hears the "No" and feels the mild shame that is the biological result of reining in impulses. But now that shame is mixed up with the feeling of being a bad boy who is trouble for his parents. He cannot bear that feeling, so he climbs away from them, higher.

**The critical question: Does the shamed child WANT to switch gears?**

Not really. He has already given up on pleasing his parents. The parents can physically remove him from the TV cabinet (and all parents will, since safety is at stake), but he is not CHOOSING to follow their lead. Because he is not choosing, he is not actually building the neural wiring he needs to switch gears on his own.

## The Timeout Cascade into Toxic Shame

When the shamed child receives a timeout "so he'll learn to listen," the situation worsens. As he sits in timeout, he does not vow to obey next time. Instead, he is overwhelmed with shame. But that shame feels so unbearable that he will do anything not to feel it.

**Defense mechanisms against unbearable shame:**
- Going numb instead of showing remorse
- Lashing out in anger
- Blaming others instead of taking responsibility
- Rebelling against the developing voice of conscience in his head
- Becoming defiant

Notice that this shame that manifests as defiance comes from both the criticism AND the punishment. Shame can also be created by:
- Ridiculing kids for their feelings or actions
- Making them feel that something about them isn't good enough
- These are all common ways adults try to "teach" kids - by shaming them

## Long-Term Effects of Shame

**Will a child be damaged for life if shamed?**

Not if it was a rare occurrence in the context of unconditional love and acceptance. But if shaming interactions are repeated throughout childhood, the shame can become **toxic** - the beginning of a fear of being defective that can shadow a person through life.

**How toxic shame manifests in adults:**

People push the shame down out of awareness, but they still feel it. They numb themselves with:
- Over-eating
- Screen time
- Overwork
- Alcohol

Most adults stumble across this repressed shame occasionally, usually when they feel embarrassed in public, and find it at least temporarily disabling.

## The Five Strategies for Guiding Without Shaming

### Strategy 1: Resist the Urge to Ridicule, Guilt Trip, or Shame in "Harmless" Ways

Many common ways of "guiding" children are actually designed to provoke shame. This includes any negative judgment about:

**Judgment about who the child is:**
- Shaming: "You'd lose your head if it wasn't glued on!"
- Non-shaming alternative: "You lost your jacket? Oh no! Let's think about where you could have left it. And let's figure out a way for you to check whether you have all your things before you leave someplace."

**Judgment about what the child wants:**
- Shaming: "You just want more, more more! You have a whole room full of toys, isn't that enough for you?"
- Non-shaming alternative: "That toy looks pretty cool. You really wish you could have it. Sweetie, we're not buying toys today. We can write it on your birthday list and maybe you can have it then, if it's still what you want most."

**Judgment about what the child feels:**
- Shaming: "You do not hate your brother; don't say such terrible things!"
- Non-shaming alternative: "Sounds like you're feeling furious at your brother. I understand. You can tell your brother what you want without attacking him."

**Judgment about what the child needs:**
- Shaming: "What? Are you a baby?! Don't you see I have enough to do taking care of your sister?"
- Non-shaming alternative: "Everybody wants to be babied sometimes. You will always be my baby, no matter how big you get. I can't carry you right now, but come here and let me give you a big cuddle."

The key pattern: Instead of judging or criticizing, empathize and set a limit.

### Strategy 2: Model the Behavior You Want

Kids look to their parents for guidance on what is socially acceptable, as long as they respect those parents. If a child has an impulse that is clearly not what gets done at their house (like peeing on the floor), they will learn to restrain that impulse. That is developing their internal brake.

**The reverse is also true:** If children see their parents indulge in being critical and yelling, they will not rein themselves in from criticizing and yelling. The parent's behavior is the template.

### Strategy 3: Welcome Discussion on All Issues

**Secrets cause shame** because they give kids the message that something is unspeakable.

**Example with a birthmark:**

It is great to tell your daughter that you don't even notice her birthmark and that she is beautiful. But you must also ensure the topic comes up occasionally for discussion so she feels comfortable bringing it up. If her experience is that others notice her birthmark and she feels different, but she cannot share that with you, then she is likely to develop shame about her birthmark.

The principle: Be age-appropriate in explanations, but nothing should be off limits for discussion.

### Strategy 4: Guide with Empathic Limits

Every time you set an empathic limit, your child practices using their internal clutch to manage impulses, which means they are developing the neural wiring to manage themselves.

**The empathy-acceptance relationship:**

The more empathic you are as you set the limit, the more your child will accept the limit, and the more they will WANT to shift gears to channel their impulses into more acceptable behavior.

**The judgment-resistance relationship:**

If the child feels judged or criticized, they will resist your limits and feel ashamed of their own impulses.

### Strategy 5: Resist the Urge to Punish

The message that a child needs to shift gears can be delivered simply through three steps:

**a. Empathizing:** "You're showing me how upset you are by yelling. You're so mad about this. This isn't what you wanted."

**b. Setting a limit:** "No yelling. That hurts my ears."

**c. Redirecting the impulse by telling the child what they CAN do:** "Tell me in words. I want to hear this, so I can help. We can figure this out."

This is how children learn right and wrong. You never need to show the child they were wrong by punishing them.

## Why Punishment Always Creates Shame

**Definition of punishment:** An action with an intent to hurt, either physically or emotionally, in order to teach a lesson.

**The paradox of punishment's effectiveness:** Punishment is effective only to the degree that the child experiences it as painful. While parents may think they are using "loving discipline" to teach their child, all punishment is experienced as painful either emotionally or physically. The child will never experience pain that is purposefully caused by the parent as loving.

**The shame message of punishment:**

The child will always experience shame:
- Shame that they aren't good enough
- Shame that they couldn't control themselves
- Shame that their parents find them lacking

Punishment intensifies the shame response to toxic levels and sends a clear message: the child is so bad that the people who are supposed to nurture and protect them are intentionally hurting them, either physically or emotionally.

**Two possible responses to punishment-induced shame:**

1. **The "good girl" response:** The child tries very, very hard to be a very good girl, her whole life. If you think this is a good outcome, have a conversation with an adult like this about her tendency to anxiety or depression.

2. **The anger response:** If you did the YES/NO exercise above and felt anger when saying NO, you may have been one of these children. These kids become defiant and resist their parents' guidance.

**The alternative to punishment:**

Connection is a much better motivator than punishment and helps you set more effective limits. The climbing child is more likely to come down when you call if there is something he wants more than to climb - that warm relationship with you.

## Outcomes of Shame-Free Guidance

This approach raises a child who:
- Can manage his feelings so he can manage his behavior
- WANTS to follow your guidance (meaning he is cooperative and has a conscience)
- Knows, deep in his bones, that he is more than enough, just the way he is
