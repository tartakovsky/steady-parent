# Getting Kids to Help Around the House: Core Principles and Strategies

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids

## The Deeper Purpose of Household Responsibilities

Research shows that kids who have household responsibilities are more likely to step up and help others outside the home. This happens because these children become accustomed to helping and they see their contributions as valuable. **Responsibility at home makes kids better citizens** - it is not merely about lightening the parental workload.

The paradox parents face: having children help is actually harder than doing tasks yourself. The benefit is not immediate time savings but rather the child's development of life skills and the positive experience of contributing to something larger than themselves.

## Six Core Barriers and Their Solutions

### Barrier 1: Kids Hate Chores

The underlying psychology: This attitude is reasonable given that most adults also find housework boring and menial. Children have competing demands on their time that feel more interesting. They genuinely cannot see why it matters if the floor gets swept.

#### Solution Framework: Address Four Basic Human Needs

**Make household tasks about fun, mastery, connection, and contribution** - these are all basic human needs that can be met through household work.

**The mastery principle**: Children can enjoy getting good at something. Draw attention to their growing competence: "Look at how she made the kitchen table shine! How'd he get so fast at pairing up socks?" Over time, children come to enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done and take pride in being capable at cooking or gardening.

**The connection principle**: Children don't see intrinsic value in household work unless they're doing it with you. Instead of sending them off to work alone, see work as an opportunity to bond. Play their favorite music and sing along. Find the joy in working together and inspire your child with it.

**Express genuine appreciation**: "Thank you so much! We make a great team... Many hands make lighter work. And then we have more time for fun together!"

**The choice principle**: Anyone will resist less if they have choices about which chores to do.

**Strategic motivation**: It doesn't hurt to have motivation waiting after family clean-up, like a trip to the playground after Saturday morning work.

**Critical warning**: If you make the experience of contributing to the family feel like a chore, your child will avoid chores like the plague.

### Barrier 2: It's Easier to Do It Ourselves

The developmental timing problem: When children are young enough to be interested in helping with housework, we shoo them away. By the time they could actually be helpful, it takes so much time to teach them that it still feels easier to do it ourselves. Additionally, by then they're absorbed in more exciting pursuits, and the battle to get them to help feels too frustrating.

#### Solution: Reframe the Purpose

**Change your attitude about why kids are doing chores.** The purpose is not to save you time - at least not initially. The purpose is for them to learn life skills and to experience how good it feels to contribute. Expect to spend time teaching and supervising.

**Start early**: The younger kids are when they begin doing household tasks, the better. Toddlers usually love helping. One parent observed: her little guy would put clothes in the washing machine, gather potatoes to bring to the kitchen, bring clothes hangers - and he actually squealed with delight at being given his next task. The parent ended up being much less frustrated despite tasks taking longer.

**Establish family expectations early**:
- "Everyone works together at our house"
- "We always clean up our own messes... come on, I'll help you..."

These framings help children begin to see themselves as contributing something of value. That feeling of contribution is a basic human need that children enjoy as much as adults do.

#### Working with Older Children

**Do you still need to work with older kids?** Yes, if you want them to enjoy chores and learn how to do them well. Rather than assigning chores and sending them off alone, try working as a team.

**The coordinator role**: Have each child participate in a project while you work with them. Your job is to be the coordinator, troubleshoot problems that come up, and keep things fun and on track.

**Concrete example**: Your 12-year-old makes eggs for breakfast while your 10-year-old makes a fruit salad and your 8-year-old makes toast. This is actually realistic, but you need to be there as the assistant to help everything go smoothly.

**The long-term payoff**: There's no reason children can't enjoy making meals for the family by the time they're teens, so that everyone in the family cooks once a week. However, it takes your involvement over time to get to that point.

### Barrier 3: Kids "Need" Us to Help Them

**Understanding the need for babying**: Kids genuinely do need babying from time to time. It reassures them that you're there to protect and nurture them. They have to work hard to keep it together at school all day, and they need plenty of opportunities at home to relax their executive selves and let their baby-selves come out.

**The consequence of unmet needs**: If they don't get those opportunities to be babied, the baby-self will surface as soon as you ask your child to help out, or even to put on his own shoes.

#### Solution: Meet the Need First, Then Set Expectations

**Connection is one of the biggest motivators for a child.** Don't be afraid to baby your child when he asks you for help. Make sure he gets plenty of other opportunities to be silly and "off duty" including spending **Special Time** together.

**The sequence matters**: First, ensure the child's need to feel "cared for" is being met. Then, when he asks for help with a task you know he can do, stay with him offering encouragement but let him handle it.

**Use humor with expectations**: If you keep your sense of humor along with your expectation that your child actually can make his own peanut butter sandwich, he'll be astonished to find that he really can do it himself. His confidence to try new tasks will grow.

### Barrier 4: Kids Don't Have Time

**The structural problem**: Our culture's way of training young people to participate in society is school. They spend hours in class, then more hours doing homework. If they participate in sports, music, or other activities, they're required to spend tremendous amounts of time practicing. By middle school, they often have no time to play. By high school, they often have no time to sleep.

#### Solution: Adapt to the Academic Calendar

**During the school year**: Give your child responsibilities that can be handled in an hour on the weekend. Keep expectations modest and achievable.

**During summer**: As summer begins, have a discussion about responsibility and work out a schedule that asks more of your child. Take the opportunity while school's not in session to teach life skills and have your child make a real contribution to the household.

### Barrier 5: Kids Don't Complete Tasks Thoroughly

**Set realistic expectations**: You can't really expect your child to do a job as well as you would. You probably weren't so thorough at his age either.

#### Three-Part Solution

**1. Teach systematically**: When teaching the task, break it down into smaller steps and help your child master each one. Take photos of them doing it - even once your child can read - and make a small poster with each step.

**2. Cede control**: Once your child takes responsibility for a task, try to minimize your control over that task. The reasoning: If he knows you're going to do it over, why should he bother trying?

**3. Focus on the positive**: The goal is for your child to WANT to do an even better job. Consider how you respond when someone criticizes the way you do a task at work, compared to when they find the positive in what you've done.

**Specific examples of reframing imperfect work**:
- If your son's dresser drawers are a shambles, at least appreciate that he's putting away his own clothes
- If your daughter takes forever to finish dishes because she chats on the phone the whole time, consider that it's really up to her how she makes the job palatable
- If there are streaks in the bathroom mirror, use them as a reminder that someone else cleaned it so you didn't have to

### Barrier 6: Kids "Forget" Their Responsibilities or Complain Bitterly

**Normalize the struggle**: Kids have a lot on their minds, from the upcoming soccer game to whether their sister got a bigger piece of pie. You can expect to have to remind kids of their responsibilities. You can expect them to complain a bit.

#### Solution: Persistence with Connection

**Don't give up, and don't get exasperated.** Chores will never be first on your child's list, and that's okay. Keep your sense of humor.

**The empathy-plus-expectation formula**: When your child complains about helping around the house or needs reminding, empathize and then restate your expectation: "I know, wouldn't it be great if the dishes washed themselves?... Come on, let's go..."

**Post a written routine** that includes the responsibilities everyone has signed up for. Then be consistent and cheerful about your expectations. This is the only way to create a habit, and what you want is a habit so your child does it automatically.

**The habit formation mechanism**: Children don't have a lot of incentive to put their plates in the dishwasher. The only reason to do it in the beginning is that you'll be in their face (in a nice way) reminding them until they do it, AND that you'll be extremely appreciative after they do it. After a while, it becomes simply a habit - "this is what we do after a meal" - and most of the time you won't have to remind them.

#### The Critical Distinction: Reminding vs. Nagging

**The difference between reminding and nagging is often simply your tone of voice.**

**The transformation technique**: Experiment with being silly and even ridiculous when you have to remind your child about a task, until everyone is laughing. Multiple things will disappear:
- The anxiety will disappear
- Any power struggle will disappear
- Your disappointment about having to remind your kids will disappear

Once there's lightness and fun about it, you might even find that your child no longer needs prompting.

## The Underlying Motivation Principle

**Like the rest of us, when children know that doing something will consistently get them a smile, hug, or warm thank you, they're more likely to do it.**

**The negative spiral**: If we think children should do tasks without reminders, we get irritable. They pick up on that irritability, and the whole interaction becomes fraught with tension. Not surprisingly, they're more likely to shy away from even thinking about that chore, which becomes loaded with a layer of unpleasant associations.

## The Long-Term Investment Perspective

Yes, it will take more effort to get your child to put his own clothes in the hamper than to do it yourself. But the repeated effort is worth it because over time those tasks will become a habit, like brushing teeth.

**Kids really do rise to meet our expectations, as long as we stay connected so they want to please us.**

The ultimate payoff: One day your child WILL serve you a meal he's made, and you'll realize you've raised a young person who can take care of himself and others, who makes a real contribution.

## Key Frameworks Summary

**Four basic human needs to address through household work**: Fun, Mastery, Connection, Contribution

**The habit formation sequence**:
1. Consistent, cheerful reminders (not nagging)
2. Genuine appreciation after completion
3. Repetition until automatic

**The developmental approach**:
- Start with toddlers who naturally want to help
- Stay involved as coordinator/assistant even with older children
- Adjust expectations to school schedule (lighter during school year, more during summer)
- Progress toward independence over years, not weeks

**The emotional foundation**: Connection must come first. Children need to feel cared for before they can extend themselves to contribute. Meet the baby-self's needs through Special Time and occasional babying, then maintain expectations with warmth and humor.
