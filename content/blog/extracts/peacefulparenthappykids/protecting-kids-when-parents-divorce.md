## The Central Paradox of Divorcing with Children

For children to come out of divorce in good shape, it helps enormously if parents can work together well for the child's benefit. But for parents to work together that effectively, they often need to work through many issues between them. This creates a paradox: if parents can develop that level of cooperation, they might as well stay together. This is why **couples counseling is recommended before making the divorce decision**, not just to potentially save the marriage, but because the skills developed in counseling are exactly what's needed to co-parent well after separation.

## Couples Counseling Outcomes

**About half of couples who go to counseling** work out their issues and stay together in a growing, happy relationship. The path to this outcome involves:

- Each person takes responsibility for growing as an individual
- Each person addresses the unresolved issues they brought into the marriage (rather than issues created by the marriage)
- They learn to stop blaming each other for their own issues
- The result is often a terrific relationship

The couples who succeed tend to be reasonably mature individuals with some basic strengths to work with, such as physical attraction and the ability to soothe themselves when upset. **Self-soothing ability** is specifically noted as a foundational relationship strength.

**The other half of couples** end up divorcing, either at the time or later. But counseling still provides significant benefits for this group:

- It helps them part in a more loving way, which benefits everyone
- Once it becomes clear the couple will split, they can use couples counseling to work out visitation, finances, and child-related agreements
- When couples do this cooperative work, **the father usually stays more involved in the child's life**, which is really important for healthy development

## What Research Shows About Children and Divorce

**The encouraging finding:** Research shows kids can cope with divorce and come out okay. Many children whose parents divorce are fine. The literature on **resiliency** identifies one of the most important protective factors: having a close relationship with at least one parent who is able to help the child with their emotions.

**The concerning finding:** Many children whose parents divorce are emotionally wounded in a way that lingers throughout their lives.

### Statistical Outcomes for Children of Divorced Parents

Children of divorced parents:
- Don't do as well academically and are less likely to go to college (partly due to financial barriers - no parent to pay for it)
- Are **25% more likely to abuse drugs by age 14**
- Are **twice as likely to get divorced themselves**

These outcomes are not inevitable but represent increased risk when protective factors are absent.

## Risk Factors That Leave Kids Scarred

### Top Three Risk Factors

1. **When parents keep fighting** - Ongoing conflict between parents, rather than the divorce itself, damages children

2. **When one parent abandons the child or doesn't stay in close contact** - The loss of relationship with a parent, not the separation of households, creates harm

3. **When the child's economic situation deteriorates** - Financial instability following divorce affects child outcomes

### Additional Risk Factors

**Poverty** is identified as the biggest risk factor. The economic logic: supporting two households is much more expensive than supporting one, creating financial strain that affects children's wellbeing and opportunities.

**Loss of mother's attention** is the second major risk. When mothers need to spend more time providing financially and handling all the details that single parents attend to, children receive less focused attention and emotional support.

**New partners who don't relate well to the child** is the third risk. When either or both parents form new relationships with partners who struggle to connect with or care for the child, this creates additional stress and potential harm.

### Special Considerations for Infants

For very young children (the example in the article is a 7-month-old), there is an added risk factor around **visitation arrangements**. The child will need to spend time with the father without the mother present. Practical considerations parents should think through:

- Whether this will really work for the baby
- Many judges aren't friendly toward nursing mothers' needs
- Courts don't always honor the need of a baby to be with the mother in divorce cases

This requires careful advance planning rather than assuming courts will accommodate infant developmental needs.

## The Protective Factor: Parental Connection

The single most important factor in child resilience after divorce is **having a close relationship with at least one parent who can help the child with their emotions**. This means:

- The relationship itself provides security
- The parent's ability to help process emotions is specifically important, not just presence
- At least one such relationship is the minimum, but presumably more is better

## Key Recommendation

**Try couples counseling before making the divorce decision.** The reasoning supports this regardless of outcome:

- If the marriage can be saved, counseling helps achieve that
- If divorce is inevitable, counseling helps parents develop the cooperation skills needed to protect their children
- Either way, the process builds capacity that benefits children

## Self-Care for the Decision-Making Parent

The article concludes with advice to "take good care of yourself, so you can be a good mom to your son." This reflects the understanding that:

- Parental wellbeing directly affects children's outcomes
- The parent's emotional state influences their capacity to be the emotionally available, supportive presence children need
- Self-care is not selfish but instrumental to child protection during divorce
