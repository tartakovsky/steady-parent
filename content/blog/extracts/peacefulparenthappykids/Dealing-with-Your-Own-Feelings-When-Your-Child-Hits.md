# How to Stop Children from Hitting: A Fear-Based Understanding and Step-by-Step Intervention

## Core Principle: Hitting Is a Fear Response, Not a Behavior Problem

**Children who hit are children who are afraid.** This is the foundational insight that reframes the entire approach. A child who lashes out physically is not being "bad" or deliberately defiant - they are overwhelmed by fear they cannot manage.

The mechanism works like this: fears from earlier frightening experiences get locked up inside the child. When a new situation triggers tension, those past fears start bubbling up. The child cannot bear those feelings, so instead of crying or asking for help, they tighten up and lash out. The aggressive behavior is a defense against feeling the underlying terror.

This explains why hitting often seems random or disproportionate to the situation - the child is not just reacting to the current moment, but to accumulated fear they have been unable to process.

**Punishing a child who hits does not stop the hitting.** Punishment increases the child's fear, which makes future hitting more likely. This creates a counterproductive cycle: the more you punish, the more afraid the child becomes, the more they hit.

To stop hitting permanently, you must address the feelings driving it.

## Why Parents React So Strongly to Their Child's Hitting

When a child hits, most parents feel mortified, angry, and embarrassed. The child's aggression triggers the parent's own fight-or-flight response. Suddenly, your own child looks like the enemy, and you feel an urgent need to take punitive action.

Understanding this reaction is essential because: if the parent remains in fight-or-flight mode, they cannot help the child feel safe. The child needs the parent's compassion to process their fear. When parents are afraid themselves, children pick up on it and get more tense, making hitting more likely.

Behind parental anger about hitting there is usually fear: fear that something is wrong with the child, fear that you are a bad parent, fear that the child will grow up to be violent. None of these fears are true, but they need to be acknowledged and felt so they do not interfere with helping the child.

## The Complete 10-Step Protocol for Addressing Hitting

### Step 1: Prevention Through Emotional Maintenance

Prevention is more effective than intervention. If your child frequently hits in social situations, you can predict hitting will likely occur in every social situation until you do intervention work.

**Preventive maintenance includes:**

- **Empathy as the default response** to everything your child expresses
- **Daily roughhousing** - physical play that allows emotional release
- **Daily one-on-one time** with each child individually
- **Consistent routines** to help the child feel safe
- **Welcoming all emotions** - this specifically includes ensuring the child gets regular opportunities to cry

These practices keep the child in good emotional shape, reducing the likelihood of hitting or emotional breakdowns.

**In-the-moment prevention during social situations:**

Stay physically close to your child so they feel connected to you. When a child feels backed up by their parent, they feel like they can handle whatever happens, making them less likely to lash out.

Being close also allows you to monitor the child's mood. If you notice them getting tense:
1. Move in physically between your child and the other child
2. Your presence may calm them
3. If your presence escalates their upset, breathe deeply and move them slightly away from other kids
4. Skip to Step 7 (welcoming the meltdown)

The benefit of this prevention approach: you help your child process the feelings that were driving toward hitting before anyone gets hurt.

### Step 2: If Hitting Occurs - Breathe and Reframe

When your child hits, your first task is managing your own reaction. Remind yourself:
- She is hitting because she is scared
- I can handle this
- She needs my compassion now

Get between your child and the other child to prevent more violence.

**Restore safety and model self-regulation by:**
- Consciously lowering your voice
- Breathing deeply
- Blowing out your tension

Your calm presence demonstrates to your child how to regulate emotions.

### Step 3: Model Care and Repair

If another adult is present, let them comfort the hit child. If not, you will need to hold and comfort that child yourself. This also gives you time to calm down before interacting with your own child, preventing you from raging at them.

Once the hurt child has calmed, put your arm around your child and face the other child together. Model what repair looks like with words like:

*"We are so very sorry that Amelia hit you. She was upset and forgot to use her words. We hope you feel better now."*

This teaches your child what repair looks like and that mistakes can be addressed with connection rather than shame.

### Step 4: Avoid Blame

You can help develop empathy by pointing out the effect of the hitting: *"Ouch, Samantha is hurt... hitting hurts!"*

However, avoid lecturing about what your child did wrong. Here is why this matters:

When children are told they did something bad, they think: *"Mom says what I did was bad... but I could not help myself... I must be bad... what if she stops loving me because I am so bad?"*

This fear of being fundamentally bad and unlovable causes the **blank stare of shame** commonly seen after a child is aggressive. Lecturing scares the child and puts them on the defensive. They stare you down, shut you out, and harden their heart.

A hardened heart cannot process fear. Processing fear is exactly what needs to happen to stop the hitting.

### Step 5: See It from Your Child's Perspective

Your child is a small person who is easily overwhelmed in a big world. They get overstimulated, disconnected from you, and feel alone and terrified.

Understanding this changes your emotional state toward the child. You need to feel sympathy for your child because your child will not soften their heart unless you soften yours first.

The parent's emotional state is the gateway to the child's emotional processing.

### Step 6: Remove Your Child from the Situation

Take more deep breaths to stay calm. Tell your child kindly:

*"Hitting hurts... It was too hard for you with the other kids... we need some time by ourselves to calm down."*

**Critical distinction:** You are not punishing, you are taking preventive action. Be kind and understanding, not mean about it.

The purpose of removal is to give your child a chance to cry or laugh - both of which help process fear. Until you help your child with the underlying feelings, hitting will almost certainly continue.

### Step 7: Resist the Urge to Lecture

You should eventually tell your child that hitting is not okay. But they already know this - they just could not stop themselves.

The way to stop hitting is to help them process the feelings that drove them to hit. They will not surface those feelings unless they feel safe. Telling them what they did wrong does not help them feel safe.

First, address feelings with words like:

*"You must have been so upset to hit Samantha... I am sorry I was not here to help... I am right here... You are safe..."*

Teaching comes later. Safety comes first.

### Step 8: Welcome the Meltdown

If the child has a meltdown because you removed them from play, this is actually good. They are showing you all the overwhelm that led them to hit and getting it out of their system.

**Why crying helps:**
- It is a natural mechanism for processing emotions
- The more tears, the more feelings being worked through
- After crying, children feel better and are less likely to hit

**How to support the meltdown:**
- Breathe your way through it
- Offer your warmth more than your words
- Talk only enough to stay connected and help them feel safe
- Do not start analyzing their feelings
- Just stay compassionate and love them through it

**If the child does not cry:**

First, soften your own heart. Empathize with how hard it was:

*"You hit Samantha... you were so upset... I was not there to help... you were worried... That was so hard for you, was it not..."*

If they still do not cry, letting them back into the play situation is risky because they are still likely to hit. Move on to teaching, but be aware you will need to get them laughing before returning to other kids, or more hitting is likely.

Laughter, like crying, helps process fear.

### Step 9: Once Both You and Your Child Are Calm - Teach

Teaching does not mean lecturing. Think of it as inviting your child to reflect on better ways to handle those feelings that they might remember next time they get mad.

Do it with a light touch and a sense of humor. You might need to wait a few hours until you can do this calmly.

**Teaching protocol:**

**Tell the story:**
*"Remember at the park today when you hit that little boy? Remember how upset he was? That hurt him. Ouch! It was hard for you too, I know. You must have been so upset to hit him. Tell me about it."*

**Listen and reflect:**
*"You were mad at him?... The sandbox was too crowded... Tell me more... Wow, so you were worried that he was going to mess up your tunnel? No wonder you were upset..."*

**Set a clear limit on behavior:**
*"I understand why you were so upset that you felt like hitting. Everyone feels that way sometimes. AND, no matter what, hitting is never okay. Hitting hurts. You can keep your tunnel safe with your words."*

**Help explore alternatives:**
*"Of course you want to keep your tunnel safe. Next time, when you get mad, what else could you do instead of hurting the other person?"*

Let them answer first. If they need help, offer alternatives:
- Could you call me?
- Could you walk away?
- Could you stomp your foot?
- Could you clap your arms around your body to hold yourself?

**Have them practice these responses:**

Create muscle memory through practice:

*"Okay, let us practice. This stuffed animal tries to grab your truck. See? You are so mad and want to hit him. But you remember there are ALWAYS other things you can do! So you clap your arms around your body like this, and you call me, okay? I am right over here talking to another mom. Call me loud - MOM!! - and I will come. Call me right now."*

Physical practice makes it more likely the child will access these alternatives when dysregulated.

### Step 10: Notice Your Own Feelings

You have big feelings about your child's hitting too, especially if it happens regularly.

Behind your anger is probably fear - fear that something is wrong with your child, that you are a bad parent, or that your child will become violent. None of these fears are true.

But you need to let that fear come up and feel it, so it is exposed to the light of day. Then it will shrink and you will be better able to help your child.

When parents are afraid, children pick up on it and get more tense. Children are secretly afraid they are disappointing their parents, that they must be terribly broken somehow. This anxiety makes them more likely to lash out.

You are not causing your child's hitting or their big feelings. But when you can manage your fear and stay compassionate, your child feels safe enough to work through their own fear.

**When there is no more fear, there is no more hitting.**

## The Logic of the Approach: Why Each Element Matters

The entire protocol is built on this causal chain:

1. Hitting stems from fear the child cannot process
2. Children cannot process fear unless they feel safe
3. Children feel safe when parents are calm and compassionate
4. Parents cannot be calm and compassionate if they are triggered
5. Therefore, parent self-regulation enables child emotional processing
6. Emotional processing (crying, laughing) releases the fear
7. Once fear is released, the drive to hit disappears

Each step serves a specific purpose in this chain. Prevention keeps fear from building up. Breathing keeps parents regulated. Avoiding blame keeps children from hardening their hearts. Removal creates space for emotional processing. Welcoming the meltdown allows the release. Teaching builds alternative pathways once the emotional charge is cleared.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Punishing hitting:** Increases fear, makes future hitting more likely.

**Lecturing immediately after hitting:** Puts the child on the defensive, causes them to shut down emotionally, hardens their heart.

**Returning to play before emotional processing:** If the child has not cried or laughed, the underlying feelings are still present and hitting remains likely.

**Letting your own fear take over:** Children sense parental fear and become more anxious, increasing the likelihood of hitting.

**Expecting immediate results from teaching:** Teaching works best after emotional processing, not as a substitute for it.

**Treating hitting as a character flaw:** Reframe it as a signal that the child is overwhelmed and scared, not as evidence they are "bad."

## Key Quote

*"Odd as it may seem, children who hit are children who are afraid. The fears that cause trouble for a child who hits usually have their roots in some frightening experience earlier in her life, even though she may not seem frightened at all. To manage her fear, the frightened child develops aggressive behavior that flares any time she feels tense. Instead of crying or saying she feels scared when her fears are triggered, she tightens up, cannot ask for help, and lashes out."* - Patty Wipfler
