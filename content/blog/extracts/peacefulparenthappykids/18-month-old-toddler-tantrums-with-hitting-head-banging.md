## The Developmental Context of Toddler Tantrums

**18-month-olds lack the neurological and verbal capacity to manage big emotions.** They don't have the verbal ability to express themselves well, and their frontal cortex is still underdeveloped. This means they literally cannot help themselves when emotions overwhelm them - they explode with frustration through hitting and tantrumming.

The comparison to adults is instructive: most adults have had the experience of bursting out yelling even with fully developed brains. For toddlers with immature emotional regulation systems, physical explosions are even more inevitable.

**Tantrums serve a biological purpose.** They are nature's way of helping young children release stress and upset feelings. Since toddlers can't yet put emotions into words and make sense of them, crying and tantrumming provide an alternative outlet. Later, as verbal and cognitive abilities develop, children will be able to process emotions through language and won't need to tantrum.

## Why Ignoring Tantrums Makes Them Worse

**The myth that parents should ignore tantrums is misguided** - this strategy actually causes children to tantrum more frequently, not less.

The reasoning: Children tantrum because they have big feelings and no other way to express them. When parents ignore a tantrumming child, he becomes doubly frustrated:
1. The original frustration remains unresolved
2. He has now also lost his connection with the parent

If the child felt that the parent understood what he was feeling, he might not need to act his feelings out so graphically. The tantrum escalates because the underlying need (to be understood and connected) goes unmet.

**This does not mean giving the child what triggered the tantrum.** Don't give the candy he's demanding, for instance - that teaches him tantrums are the way to get what he wants. The distinction is between:
- Ignoring the child's emotional state (counterproductive)
- Not giving in to the demand (appropriate limit-setting)

## Why Timeouts Make Behavior Worse

**Research shows that timeouts worsen children's behavior.** The mechanisms:
1. Timeouts make children feel worse about themselves
2. Timeouts erode the parent-child relationship
3. The parent-child relationship is the parent's only source of influence with the child

When the relationship suffers, the parent loses leverage for guiding behavior. The punishment approach backfires because it damages the very connection needed to help the child develop better emotional regulation.

**Replace timeouts with "time-in"** - sitting with the upset child instead of isolating them.

## The Emotional Architecture Behind Hitting and Head-Banging

**Under anger are more vulnerable emotions - tears and fears.** The anger displayed during tantrums is the child's fight-or-flight response. He's protecting himself from the more vulnerable emotions underneath.

This explains the hitting and head-banging behavior: the child is in a protective defensive mode, lashing out because the softer emotions feel too threatening to experience directly.

**The goal is to help the child access the vulnerable emotions.** When you can help the child show their tears and fears, they won't need the anger anymore. The child may cry or flail, but they won't be hitting or banging their head - because the defensive aggression has been replaced by the authentic grief underneath.

## The Six-Step Approach to Tantrums with Hitting/Head-Banging

### Step 1: Start with Empathy

If the child feels understood, he is less likely to bang his head or hit. Empathy addresses the root cause of the escalation.

**Specific language:**
- "You are so mad..."
- "You wish you could have that..."

### Step 2: Block Hitting Without Punishment

**If he tries to hit you, move out of reach.** Physical distance protects you while maintaining connection.

**If he follows you to hit you, gently hold his hands** while speaking calmly:
- "You're so mad."
- "No hitting."
- "Hitting hurts."
- "Say MAD!"

The calm tone is crucial. You're setting a limit without escalating his arousal level.

### Step 3: Create Safety to Access Vulnerable Emotions

**Safety enables the emotional shift from anger to tears.** The child can only let go of the defensive anger if he feels safe enough to be vulnerable.

How to create safety:
- Soften your own heart
- Empathize with his pain
- Tell him you understand
- If he'll let you, hold him
- If not, stay close

**Key phrases:**
- "You're safe. I'm right here."
- "You are safe..."
- "I'm right here..."
- "It's okay, everybody needs to cry sometimes..."
- "You're doing hard work..."
- "Whenever you are ready I will hold you."

Keep the child enveloped in your love while making occasional soothing comments so he knows you're present during the tantrum.

### Step 4: Don't Lecture or Reason During the Emotional Release

**Let him cry and struggle without attempting to teach.** The crying itself is doing the work of releasing tension. Your loving presence helps him feel safe enough to complete the process.

Lecturing while emotions are high is counterproductive because:
- The child can't process verbal information when flooded with emotion
- Teaching attempts interrupt the emotional release
- The focus should be on safety and presence, not lessons

### Step 5: Respond to "Go Away!" Appropriately

**If he yells "Go away!":**
- Take a step back (honoring his expressed need)
- Say: "I am moving back, away. But I am right here if you need me. I won't leave you alone with all these upset feelings."

This response:
- Respects his autonomy and expressed boundary
- Maintains your supportive presence
- Communicates that he won't be abandoned with overwhelming emotions

### Step 6: Receive the Emotional Resolution

**Eventually, he will melt into your arms and sob.** This is the shift from defensive anger to vulnerable grief.

Your job during the crying:
- Let him cry as long as he needs
- Offer a compassionate safe haven
- Don't try to talk while he is crying
- Summon all your compassion and hold him

**The aftermath is transformative.** After this kind of emotional release with a compassionate witness, the child becomes noticeably happier, more cooperative, and more affectionate.

## The Mechanism: Why Hitting Stops When You Hold This Approach

**The child has been storing up "yucky" feelings.** The only safe way to express them is with the person he feels safest with - which is why he hits the parent.

**When you block hitting but stay loving:**
1. The anger vanishes (because the defensive function is no longer needed)
2. The hurt, sadness, and fear are released (which is what the child actually needed)

This explains why the behavior improves: the child no longer needs to escalate to get the emotional release he requires. The safe outlet has been provided.

## Why Children Need Attention During Tantrums

**If a child has to resort to tantrumming for attention, he is sending an SOS** that he isn't getting enough attention generally.

This reframes tantrums not as manipulation but as communication about unmet needs.

**Giving attention during tantrums won't increase tantrumming** - as long as the child is also getting plenty of attention when he isn't tantrumming. The child isn't learning that tantrums earn attention; he's learning that his parent is a safe haven for big emotions.

## Parental Self-Regulation During Tantrums

**Most parents find this approach challenging at first.** Being a compassionate witness for someone else's pain, particularly your child's, is hard.

**Self-talk strategy for staying calm:**
Use the same loving, nurturing tone with yourself that you'd use with the child:
- "Everyone needs to cry sometimes"
- "I am giving my child a priceless gift"
- "The loving acceptance of the full range of his feelings"
- "An opportunity to heal all that yucky emotional stuff he's unloading"

Reframing the tantrum as a healing opportunity rather than a behavior problem helps the parent stay regulated.

## The Long-Term Benefits of This Approach

**Immediate benefits:**
- Tantrums lessen in severity
- The child stops needing to hurt the parent or himself
- The relationship deepens

**Long-term benefits:**
- The child becomes much more cooperative
- This cooperation extends not just through the "terrible twos" but throughout childhood

**The gift to the parent:** As much as attentive parenting benefits the child, it benefits the parent even more through the improved relationship and cooperation that result.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Ignoring tantrums** - doubles the child's frustration by adding disconnection to the original upset
2. **Using timeouts** - research shows they worsen behavior by damaging self-concept and relationship
3. **Giving in to demands** - teaches that tantrums are effective for getting wants met
4. **Lecturing during emotional flooding** - child can't process, and it interrupts the release
5. **Leaving the child alone with big feelings** - even when asked to "go away," maintain presence nearby
6. **Reacting punitively to hitting** - holding hands firmly while punishing escalates rather than resolves
7. **Expecting quick fixes** - the approach requires consistent application over time

## Key Concepts Summary

| Concept | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Anger as defense | Under the hitting is fear and sadness; accessing vulnerable emotions resolves the aggression |
| Connection during distress | Children tantrum more when ignored because disconnection adds to frustration |
| Timeouts damage | They erode the relationship that is the parent's only source of influence |
| Empathy first | Feeling understood reduces the need to escalate |
| Safety enables release | The child can only let go of defensive anger when feeling safe |
| Crying as healing | Tantrums serve a developmental function of releasing stored emotion |
| Attention isn't reward | Giving attention during tantrums doesn't reinforce them if the child also gets attention at other times |
