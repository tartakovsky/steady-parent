## The Core Problem: SAP Disorder

**SAP Disorder** stands for "Sacrificing yourself on the Altar of Parenthood." This concept describes what happens when parents forget to give themselves the loving attention they need.

### How to Recognize SAP Disorder

You may be experiencing SAP Disorder if you notice:
- Frequent feelings of resentment, depletion, or exhaustion
- Negative mind chatter about your child
- Yelling at your child on a regular basis

### Why SAP Disorder Is Harmful

The damage flows in two directions:

**To the parent:** Feeling deprived kills your natural joy. You cannot sustain parenting well when running on empty.

**To the child:** Children end up with a resentful, negative, impatient parent. This does NOT help them behave better - it makes things worse. When parents are stressed, children get stressed too. They don't feel the parent's love, which leads them to conclude that somehow they aren't good enough to cause the parent to love them. This anxiety manifests as neediness, defiance, and difficult behavior.

## The Central Insight: Self-Care and Parenting Are Not Mutually Exclusive

Traditional ideas of self-care assume you need to be child-free to care for yourself. This framing creates a false choice and makes self-care feel impossible for parents who can't easily get time alone.

**The reframe:** Self-care can happen while you are with your children. Examples include:
- Taking deep breaths while sitting with a screaming child
- Having a cup of tea while reading your child a book
- Cranking music loud at home and doing your own dance class with kids present

This reframe is powerful because it removes the barrier of needing child-free time, making self-care accessible in any moment.

## The Core Principle: You Set the Weather

No matter what children do, it is ultimately the parent's responses that determine the emotional weather in the home. This means:

1. **You are the center of the family** - if you don't take care of yourself, you cannot be the parent you want to be
2. **Monitoring your own moods and returning yourself to calm is one of the most important responsibilities of parenting**
3. **When your needs drop off the list, it isn't sustainable**

### The Positive Feedback Loop

When parents practice self-care and experience joy:
- Children love their parent's joyful presence
- Children respond by becoming happier and more cooperative
- The parent experiences more of the joy and delight present in every day with children

When parents are stressed:
- Children get stressed
- Children don't feel loved
- Children become anxious, needy, defiant, and difficult
- This depletes the parent further

## The Solution: Honor Both Your Needs and Your Child's Needs

Parenting IS about nurturing your child - noticing what they need and trying to make sure they get it. But this does not mean telling your child to forget about getting their needs met so yours come first.

The solution is to put yourself back on the list and tend to yourself as well as you can each moment of the day, just as you do your child. You can honor BOTH sets of needs.

## Five Practical Strategies

### Strategy 1: Tune Into Yourself Throughout the Day

**The practice:** Make it a habit to tune into yourself as often as possible. Take a deep breath and let it flood your body. Breathe in calm, breathe out stress.

**Enhanced technique:** Research shows that putting your hand on your chest and imagining that you're breathing into your heart has a calming effect on the entire nervous system.

**Why this works:** Noticing your breath helps you be more present with yourself, which is an essential form of "attention" that we all need. Every time you tap into that conscious attention, you're disarming the subconscious patterns of anxiety and shallow breathing that autopilot most of us most of the time.

### Strategy 2: Check In When Resentful or Irritable

**The practice:** Every time you notice that you're getting resentful or irritable, stop. Ask yourself: "What do I need right now to stay in balance?" Then give it to yourself - whether your child is there or not.

**Immediate options (with children present):**
- Five minutes to sit on the back steps and listen to the birds
- A glass of water
- Five minutes of dancing

**If you can't do it right now, make a date with yourself for later:**
- A bath after the kids go to bed
- Trading shoulder massages with your partner
- More sleep tonight

The key insight is that you don't have to wait for child-free time. Many forms of self-care can happen in the moment, even with children present.

### Strategy 3: Plan for Challenging Times

**The practice:** Notice the challenging times of day and find ways to nurture yourself through them.

**The mindset shift:** It's your life, and you're in charge, whether it feels that way or not. Letting yourself feel victimized doesn't help your kids.

**Example - bedtime struggles:** If bedtime drives you crazy, make a plan to make it better:
- Share more responsibility with your partner
- Start the bedtime routine earlier
- Post a bedtime schedule with photos (that you make with your kids)
- Get more sleep yourself
- Enjoy a cup of tea while you read to your child

The point is proactive problem-solving rather than suffering through difficult times repeatedly.

### Strategy 4: Consciously Parent Yourself

**The core realization:** It is your job to be your own parent. If you're old enough to have a child yourself, your parents are off the hook. It's your responsibility now.

**What self-parenting looks like:**
- Talk to yourself like someone you love
- Nurture yourself through the hard times
- Acknowledge all your efforts in the right direction
- Accept that you're not perfect and don't need to be
- Give yourself all the tenderness you would shower on a newborn baby

**Why this transforms parenting:** Flooding yourself with love and compassion is deeply healing. Giving that love to yourself will open your heart and transform your parenting.

### Strategy 5: Be Present and Don't Postpone Joy

**The practice:** Soak in the beauty and happiness of every moment you can. Stop rushing and revel in:
- Your child's laughter
- The sweet smell of their hair
- Their joy in mastering something new

**Why this matters:** "Smelling the roses" is what makes parenting worth all the headaches. It replenishes your spirit, inspires children to connect and cooperate, and cures SAP Disorder.

Self-care is essential not only to remain patient, but also to experience the joy and delight that is present - and often overlooked - in every day with children. This applies even on the tough days and with the tough kids.
