## Core Understanding: Why Toddlers Hit

**Hitting is developmentally normal** for toddlers around 21 months old. It is not a character flaw or a sign of bad parenting. Understanding why it happens is essential for responding effectively.

### The Developmental Reality at 21 Months

- **Low frustration tolerance**: Toddlers cannot yet handle the gap between what they want and what they can have
- **Minimal impulse control**: When they want something, the desire feels overwhelming and they will do whatever is necessary to get it - no substitute will do
- **Underdeveloped awareness of others' needs**: Their own needs feel urgent and real; others' needs are abstract and distant
- **Pre-verbal limitations**: They cannot express their feelings or negotiate, so physical action becomes their only available tool

This combination means that when another child stands between a toddler and something they want, they will "run right over them, literally." This does not make them bad - it makes them 21 months old.

### The Emotional Mechanics Behind Hitting

When a toddler hits over a toy, they are not being malicious. Their desire for that object feels more intense than anything they have ever wanted. To adults this seems like no big deal, but to the child, the intensity is genuine. When we understand this, we can respond with empathy rather than punishment.

**Key insight**: Sometimes what looks like wanting a toy is actually about something deeper - frustration with being small and powerless in a big world. This is why a child might cry intensely about a toy and then, after being comforted, not even care about it anymore. The tears were about the underlying frustration, not the object itself.

## Why Playgroups Are Particularly Difficult

Playgroups create a perfect storm of stress for sensitive toddlers, which increases hitting behavior. Understanding these stressors explains why a child who behaves well at home might struggle in group settings.

### Stressors in Group Settings

1. **Sensory overload**: Noise, many people, lots of stimulation
2. **Constant social navigation**: Having to interact with unfamiliar peers
3. **Competition for resources**: Toys are limited and contested
4. **Disconnection from caregiver**: Mom is typically chatting with other adults, leaving the child feeling "a little un-looked after"
5. **Lack of safety**: Just when they get a toy, another child might grab it - they cannot relax

**Research backing**: Children's cortisol levels (stress hormone) measurably increase in group play situations. This stress response makes children feel less safe, and when humans feel less safe, they become less generous with others.

### Why One-on-One Play Works Better

Highly sensitive preverbal kids do better with one-on-one play because:
- Less stimulation to process
- Clearer social dynamics
- More parental attention available
- Fewer competitors for resources
- Child can feel safer and therefore act more generously

As children gain verbal ability and negotiation skills, they become more comfortable navigating group dynamics. Until then, limiting group exposure while working on underlying skills is a valid strategy.

## The Problem with Forced Sharing and Turn-Taking

**Conventional sharing rules often backfire** and can actually increase hitting behavior. This counterintuitive point is crucial for understanding what helps versus what hurts.

### Why Forcing Turns Triggers Aggression

When adults force a preverbal toddler to give up a toy:
- The child does not understand what is happening
- They cannot express their outrage verbally
- They learn that toys can be grabbed away at any time - even by their "usually trustworthy mommy"
- This makes them feel less safe
- Feeling unsafe, they become more possessive and more likely to grab from others
- The adult is inadvertently modeling "grabbing" behavior

**The cascade**: We think we are teaching sharing, but we are actually teaching that this environment is threatening and requires aggressive self-protection.

### A Better Approach: Child-Controlled Turn Length

The recommended playgroup rule: **The child with the toy can use it as long as they like. The child determines how long their turn lasts.**

How this works:
- If another child wants the toy, adults help that child wait by acknowledging their upset and finding something else to do
- Children eventually learn they are in control of how long they use things
- Because they feel in control, they stop feeling so possessive
- Adults are not modeling grabbing
- When children are actually done with a toy, they give it to the waiting child voluntarily
- This voluntary giving creates a warm interaction that reinforces generosity

**The psychological shift**: Children get the actual experience of how great it feels to be generous, rather than the experience of having things taken from them.

## Preparation Before Social Situations

Preparation significantly increases the chances of things going smoothly. It gives the child a mental map of what to expect and reassurance that they have support.

### Elements of Effective Preparation

Before a playdate, describe:
1. **Where you are going**: "When we get to Joshua's house..."
2. **Who will be there**: "...there will be two other boys there, named Michael and Devon."
3. **What activities will happen**: "You and the other boys will all play together in the wading pool in the yard."
4. **Parent availability**: "Mommy will be right there if you need me."
5. **Expected behavior**: "We will all keep our hands on our own bodies."
6. **What to do if they want something**: "If you want a toy, you tell me and I will help you talk to whoever has the toy so you can have a turn with it."
7. **What to do if they get upset**: "If you get mad, you tell me, and I will help you, ok?"
8. **Consequences**: "If you forget and hit, we can't play, so will need to stop having fun and leave."
9. **Reassurance of backup**: "So I will be right there to help you if you need me, ok?"

This preparation accomplishes several things: it sets clear expectations, offers alternative behaviors, promises support, and establishes consequences without threat or punishment.

## In-the-Moment Intervention Strategies

### Staying Close and Emotionally Present

**Physical proximity matters**: Stay within arm's reach while the child plays with other kids.

Why this helps:
- The connection helps the child feel safer
- Feeling safer means feeling less threatened
- Less threat translates to less aggressiveness
- You can intervene before violence occurs

**Social management**: Tell other parents upfront: "Cole is going through a stage where he grabs toys from other kids, and I am trying to nip it in the bud by staying next to him. I hope you won't think I'm rude, but today I need to really focus on him. I look forward to catching up with you next time."

Accept that for this phase, you will get virtually no adult interaction at playgroups. Find other ways to connect with adults. This phase will not last.

### Teaching Negotiation Through Modeling

When you see your child about to grab or hit, intervene with modeling:

**Name what they want**: "You really want the dump truck."

**Describe the current reality**: "Devon has it right now."

**Offer a path forward**: "Let's ask Devon if you can have it when he's done."

**Model the words**: Speak to the other child for your child: "Devon, can Cole use the dump truck when you're done? Thank you!"

### Offering Solutions and Trades

Go beyond just waiting - offer creative alternatives:

"Devon has the dump truck right now and it will be your turn soon. I see it's hard to wait. Do you think we could offer to trade Devon for the snow plow? He might say no, but we could ask."

Then model how to make the offer. This teaches:
- Problem-solving approaches
- That trades are possible
- How to handle rejection if it comes

### When Trades Fail: Empathy and Reassurance

If the other child says no to a trade:
1. **Empathize with the disappointment**: "You love that dump truck. It's hard to see someone else playing with it."
2. **Name the difficulty**: "It's really hard to wait."
3. **Affirm what they are doing right**: Positively acknowledge that they are not hitting
4. **Reassure about the future**: "Devon says he will give you the dump truck when he is done."
5. **Remind them of support**: "I will help you wait."

### Teaching Attention Management for Impulse Control

Help the child learn to redirect their attention, which is the foundation of impulse control:

"Let's wait for your turn. I will help you wait. While we wait, let's use the snowplow and make a road that the dump truck can drive on."

This teaches:
- Attention can be shifted
- Waiting can be filled with other activities
- Frustration does not have to dominate

## Handling Meltdowns Constructively

### When Distraction Fails

If the child is too upset to be distracted and ends up crying, that is okay. This is not a failure.

**Your job during a meltdown**:
- Hug them
- Let them cry
- Tell them you understand
- Name their feelings: "You really wish you could have that dump truck. It's hard to see someone else playing with a toy you want so much. It's hard to wait."

### What Crying Accomplishes

When a child cries while being comforted, they are getting something more valuable than the toy:
- A chance to express the depths of their despair
- Being understood and accepted by their most important person
- Learning that the full range of who they are is acceptable, even lovable

**Long-term impact**: This feeling of being wholly loved and lovable will extend, over time, into more generosity with others.

### Where to Have the Meltdown

**Staying in place** has benefits: removing a child from the scene can make them feel less safe and more upset.

**Leaving the room** may be necessary if:
- You feel too self-conscious
- Other parents might intervene inappropriately (grabbing the toy from the other child to stop the crying)
- The child might learn that crying gets them the toy

If you move, pick them up and carry them to the next room rather than making them walk while distressed.

### Responding to Other Parents' Judgment

If other parents seem to disapprove of comforting a crying child, you can say:

"I find that if I acknowledge his big feelings, he doesn't have to act them out as much. It's okay. He has to learn to wait for his turn. I'm helping him develop empathy by offering him empathy."

Then focus on your child. After the crying and comforting, children are typically much more relaxed and less aggressive. Sometimes what they needed all along was to reconnect with mom or release stress.

## When Hitting Actually Happens

### Immediate Response Sequence

1. **Take a deep breath and stay calm**
2. **Attend to the other child first** while keeping your arm around your child: "I'm so sorry. That must hurt. Cole is so sorry he hit you. We hope you feel better. Cole was frustrated and he forgot to use his words, didn't you, Honey?"
3. **If your child is calm enough**, help them comfort the other child
4. **If your child is not calm**, do not force it - they are still in fight or flight

### Why Removal is Necessary

**Any child who hits has big feelings going on that they need help to process. Until they do, they will hit again.**

Therefore: it is irresponsible to let them stay in the group and play. Remove them to a safe, private place and help them cry (or laugh) those feelings out. After that, it is safe to return.

### During the Removal

If you cannot have the meltdown on site:
- Apologize to the hostess over the din (you can call her later)
- Grab your things
- Take the child to the car
- Hold them while they cry

### After the Hit: What to Say

**Do not reprimand**. The child has already suffered the natural consequences of their aggressiveness. Now they need empathy so they can process their feelings.

**What they need to hear**:
1. Acknowledgment of their feelings: "You are so sad and mad that we have to leave, and that you had to give Devon the dump truck."
2. Clear statement of the rule: "But when you hit, it hurts, and we have to give back the toy and leave."
3. Distinction between feelings and behavior: "It's okay to get upset, but it is NOT ok to hit."
4. What to do instead: "We use our words and we keep our hands on our own bodies."
5. Understanding of their struggle: "I know that you got really upset."
6. Promise of future help: "Next time I will help you use your words."
7. Normalization: "It's hard when you're little."
8. Confidence in their growth: "But you're getting bigger all the time. Soon you'll remember."

This approach communicates that they are not bad, just small, and that you have faith in their ability to master this developmental challenge.

## Reinforcement and Ongoing Development

### Reinforcing Pro-Social Behavior

Notice and celebrate every positive step, including near-misses:

"You wanted the dumptruck and you used your words to tell us! Wow! Good for you! You must be so proud! Let's see if Devon can give you a turn soon."

The phrase "you must be so proud" is significant - it shifts the locus of approval from external (parent's praise) to internal (child's own pride).

### Honoring Feelings Throughout Daily Life

Make it constant practice to acknowledge feelings while setting limits. This develops the emotional intelligence necessary to manage emotions.

**Example formula**:
1. Acknowledge the wish: "You wish you could have that candy."
2. State the limit: "It's almost dinner time, so no candy."
3. Name the feeling: "I know that makes you sad."
4. Offer an alternative: "You can have some carrots if you're hungry."
5. Offer comfort: "I can give you a hug to make you feel better."
6. Offer connection: "We can snuggle on the couch and read your book."
7. Accept their distress: "I see you're too sad and mad to read right now, you want that candy so much you're crying. It's hard to be so sad and mad."
8. Stay available: "When you're ready I'll hold you and give you a big hug."

This shows you do not have to agree with the child or give in to their demands. You acknowledge their feelings and offer empathy while maintaining the limit.

## Building Empathy as Prevention

### The Core Principle

**The reason we don't hit other people is that we feel for them.** Empathy development is the long-term solution to hitting.

### Daily Empathy-Building Opportunities

Use everyday moments to help your child notice and wonder about others' feelings:

- "Look, that little girl is crying in her stroller. I wonder why she's so sad?"
- "Oh oh, Robbie fell down and got hurt. Ouch, that must hurt. Do you think it would cheer him up if we offered him a hug?"
- "Kaylee sure is mad. She doesn't want to go home, does she?"

These observations build the neural pathways for recognizing others' emotional states.

## Teaching Safe Expression of Frustration

### The Teach-When-Calm Principle

All emotional regulation techniques must be taught when the child is feeling good, then reminded when they are upset. Trying to teach during distress does not work.

### Specific Techniques

**Mad faces**: During a calm moment, say "Let's make mad faces. Then you can show me when you're mad." In a tense moment: "Wow, are you mad. Show me how mad you are with your mad face."

**Squeeze ball**: Offer a squeeze ball and tell them to fill it up with their mad feelings.

**Calming breath**: Breathe in deeply through the nose, hold it a moment, and let it out very slowly through a small hole in your lips.

These give the child tools beyond hitting for expressing intense feelings.

## The Parent's Internal Work

### Reframing the Experience

This phase is hard on parents - it is exhausting, embarrassing, and isolating. But it is also a perfect opportunity to help your child develop empathy and emotional intelligence.

**The long view**: The high EQ you are fostering will be an asset for the rest of your child's life.

### Self-Care Reminder

When holding a melting-down child in public after a hitting incident: take a deep breath, and give yourself a pat on the back for being a great parent. The work you are doing is invisible but invaluable.

## Summary of the Developmental Framework

The hitting phase happens because:
- 21-month-olds have intense desires and no verbal or impulse control tools
- Group settings increase stress, which decreases generosity
- Forced sharing teaches that environments are threatening

The hitting phase ends because:
- Children gain verbal ability
- Children gain impulse control
- Children develop empathy through experiencing empathy
- Children learn negotiation through modeling
- Children feel safe enough to be generous

The parent's job is to help the child come through this phase feeling like a good person who can manage themselves and create positive relationships - not a bad person who cannot control themselves and hurts others. The goal is building identity and self-concept, not just managing behavior.

**Light at the end of the tunnel**: This phase passes. The crankiness passes. The hitting passes. With patient guidance, children grow into capable social beings.
