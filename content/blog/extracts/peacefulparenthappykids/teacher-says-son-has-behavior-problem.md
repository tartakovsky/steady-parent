## Core Principle: Trust Teacher Observations and Act Early

When a teacher suggests that a child needs professional help for behavior problems, parents should take this seriously. The reasoning behind this: **teachers see a lot of children**, which gives them a meaningful baseline for comparison. If a teacher observes that a specific child's behavior stands out enough to warrant professional intervention, that observation almost certainly reflects a real need.

**Timing matters critically.** The recommendation is to intervene now, before the child begins to internalize a negative self-image. The specific concern is that without intervention, the child may start to "think of himself as a child who can't get along well at school." This self-concept, once formed, becomes an additional barrier to improvement. Early intervention prevents this identity formation from taking hold.

## Recommended Action: Professional Assessment by a Child Psychologist

The primary recommendation is to take the child to a **child psychologist** in your area. The psychologist serves three distinct functions:

1. **Assessment** - Evaluating the child to understand what is happening
2. **Diagnosis/Understanding** - Helping parents understand *why* the child is misbehaving (not just that they are misbehaving)
3. **Treatment Planning** - Developing a concrete plan to change the child's behavior

Understanding the "why" behind the behavior is emphasized as a necessary precursor to effective intervention. Without understanding the root cause, behavior modification attempts may be misdirected or ineffective.

## Three Options for Finding a Child Psychologist

### Option 1: Ask the School
Schools typically have either:
- A psychologist on staff, or
- A psychologist they regularly refer parents to

This is listed as the first option, suggesting it's often the most accessible starting point.

### Option 2: University Medical Center Child Development Center
Contact **The Child Development Center** at your local University Medical Center. These centers have specialists on staff and can conduct a thorough assessment. The emphasis on "thorough assessment" suggests these centers may offer more comprehensive evaluation compared to other options.

### Option 3: County Mental Health Association
Call the **Mental Health Association** of your local county. When you explain the situation, they can refer you to a local clinic that specializes in treating children. This option positions the Mental Health Association as a referral service that can connect families with appropriate specialized clinics.

## Finding the Right Fit

The goal is to find a psychologist who meets three criteria:
1. **Parent likes and trusts** the psychologist
2. **Child likes** the psychologist
3. **Effective** - the psychologist will help the child do well in school

The inclusion of "likes and trusts" for both parent and child as explicit criteria suggests that therapeutic relationship quality matters for treatment success, not just the practitioner's technical qualifications.

## What This Approach Does Not Include

**Remote/phone-based treatment limitations:** Even an expert cannot adequately assess and treat a child by phone. This is stated explicitly to explain why in-person professional evaluation is necessary rather than remote consultation, regardless of the expertise of the remote consultant. Assessment of a child requires direct observation and interaction that cannot be replicated remotely.
