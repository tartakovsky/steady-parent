# Managing Your Temper as a Parent: The "Do Nothing" Approach

## The Core Principle: Do Nothing When Anger Rises

When you feel your temper rising, the most effective response is to **do nothing**. You notice what you're feeling, breathe through it, and refrain from action. This feels counterintuitive because when our temper rises, we all feel an urgent need to DO something, anything. But that urgency comes from our **emergency response system** activating, and parenting - despite how it feels in the moment - is not usually an emergency.

The reason doing nothing works: **the rational brain stops working when you're angry**. When you act from anger or fear, you're never taking constructive action. You must restore yourself to calm before you act, because only then can your rational brain guide your response.

## The Fear-Driven Trap

When temper rises, it feels like we MUST intervene at that moment. The fear-based thinking goes: otherwise, the child will "get away with" bad behavior and become a terrible person. But this is fear speaking, and it drives us to take actions that make things worse.

What happens when we act from fear and anger:
- We let our emotions run amok
- We don't guide our child with love
- We don't help the child WANT to be more responsible or cooperative
- We fail to manage our anger responsibly
- We dump the yucky feelings from our "emotional backpack" onto our child

Yes, the child was not cooperating at that moment. But acting out of anger means modeling exactly what we don't want to teach.

## The Five-Step Framework for Rising Temper

### Step 1: Notice You're Getting Swept Into Fight or Flight

**Early warning signs to watch for:**
- An exasperated sigh
- Your voice getting louder
- Your jaw clenching
- Your mind starting to churn with irritated thoughts

Once you notice these signs, you've given yourself a heads-up that trouble's brewing, and you now have a choice about how to respond. Noticing transforms automatic reaction into conscious choice.

**Why noticing is hard but gets easier:** When you practice noticing the small upsets before getting hijacked by anger, you're actually **rewiring your brain** to slow down the quick leap to anger. Every moment of irritation becomes a practice opportunity rather than a failure.

### Step 2: Stop, Drop (Your Agenda), and Breathe

**"Stop, Drop and Breathe"** functions as an enhanced PAUSE button.

**If no physical intervention is absolutely required:** Just hold still and breathe deeply.

**If you do need to move toward your child** (to stop them from hitting the dog or throwing a toy): Still breathe deeply while you move.

**Why deep breathing works:** It interrupts the stress hormones flooding your body. It makes you aware of all those sensations of anger, preventing you from going on auto-pilot and starting to rage.

### Step 3: Resist Taking Action

Just breathe and tolerate the feelings until they pass.

**What this feels like (it will feel awful):**
- You'll feel like lashing out (fight response)
- You'll feel like running away (flight response)
- You'll feel like numbing yourself with food or a screen (freeze response)
- You might feel like you can't breathe
- You might feel like throwing up

**The key practice:** Keep breathing into those sensations in your body. The feelings WILL pass.

**If it feels too hard:** Wrap your arms around your body and flood yourself with love. This sounds corny but it works.

**Realistic expectations:** You won't manage this every time unless you're a saint. But every time you do succeed, you're:
- Emptying your emotional backpack of old baggage
- Rewiring your brain so you're less likely to get hijacked by anger next time
- Modeling responsible anger management and emotional intelligence for your child

### Step 4: Work Hard to See Things from Your Child's Point of View

**The danger of being "sure you're right":** If you're certain you're right and the other person is wrong, you're already moving into fight mode, where your child looks like the enemy.

**Thoughts to notice and catch:**
- Thoughts that say your child is choosing to give you a hard time
- If you don't catch these thoughts, you'll blow up sooner or later

**The reframe (which is actually more true):** "She's having a hard time; she needs my help."

This reframe shifts the child from adversary to someone who needs support, which changes everything about how you'll respond.

### Step 5: Choose Love

**The fundamental framework:** Every action we take can ultimately be seen as a choice between love and fear. Fear is always lurking behind anger.

Once you free yourself from the leap to fight or flight, you can do what we always tell our children: **make a better choice**.

**What "choosing love" might look like in the moment:**
- Set a limit, but set it with empathy: "You wish you could.... I know it's hard when...."
- Summon compassion so your angry child feels safe enough to drop the shield of anger and soften into the tears or fears behind their anger
- Move into playful mode to let your child save face
- Listen to why your child is so upset
- Hold out your arms for a hug

## Understanding Mindfulness in Parenting Context

**Mindfulness** means being present with - noticing - our own feelings and thoughts WITHOUT acting on them.

**Sharon Salzberg's definition:** "Mindfulness is not hitting someone in the mouth."

This direct phrasing captures the essence: mindfulness is about the gap between stimulus and response, the space where we notice our urge but don't act on it.

## The Timing of Teaching

**When to teach:** Once you're calm AND your child is calm.

At that point, you'll be able to listen to your child and empathize.

**When not to teach:** Until you're calm, don't try to teach, or you'll inadvertently teach the wrong lessons.

**The lessons you actually want to teach:**
- How to self-regulate
- How to state your own needs without attacking the other person
- How to find compassion for yourself and your loved one when you disagree
- How to connect
- How to apologize
- How to start over
- How to choose love

## The "Emotional Backpack" Concept

We carry around accumulated emotions from past experiences - an **emotional backpack**. When we lose our temper with our children, we're dumping those yucky feelings from our full emotional backpack onto them.

Each time we successfully breathe through anger without acting on it, we're emptying that backpack of old baggage.

## Situations Where This Framework Applies

The framework applies when:
- Your child is defiant
- Your child is whining
- Your child is tantrumming
- Your child forgets something, again
- Your child isn't listening to you
- Your child clobbers your other child

In all these situations, the question becomes: **Can you choose love?**

## Key Distinctions

**Physical intervention vs. emotional response:** Sometimes you DO need to physically move or intervene (to stop a child from hurting the dog, etc.). The framework isn't about never acting physically - it's about not letting anger drive your emotional response and words. You can move your body while still breathing deeply and staying regulated.

**Feeling the feelings vs. acting on them:** The goal isn't to not feel angry. The goal is to feel the anger fully (it will feel awful) without the feelings driving your actions. Tolerating difficult feelings until they pass is the core skill.
