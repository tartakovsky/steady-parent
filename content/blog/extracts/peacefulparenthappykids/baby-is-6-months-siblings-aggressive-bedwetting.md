# Sibling Aggression and Bedwetting Regression When a New Baby Arrives

## The Timeline of Sibling Jealousy

**Baby jealousy often intensifies around the 6-month mark**, not immediately after birth. While some children begin acting out when the baby is around 3 months old, many families are still in the "honeymoon phase" and too enamored with the newborn to notice behavioral issues developing. By six months, the baby is obviously not leaving, which can trigger older siblings to start acting out. The permanence of the new family member becomes undeniable, and children who seemed fine initially may begin showing signs of distress.

## Understanding Age-Appropriate Aggression in 4-Year-Old Boys

### The Testosterone Factor

Most 4-year-old boys are "feeling their testosterone" - this is a developmental reality, not a behavioral problem to be eliminated. This manifests in several predictable ways:

- **The urge to wrestle and engage in physical play** - they need outlets for this energy
- **Superhero play and weapon fascination** - a plastic sword being used "as a weapon" is developmentally normal (as one child pointed out when his sword was confiscated: "But MOM it IS a weapon!")
- **Territory marking behaviors** - including, sometimes literally, urinating in inappropriate places
- **Physical aggression toward siblings** - punching and fighting

### The Critical Distinction: Redirect, Don't Suppress

The key principle is to **redirect aggressive energy rather than trying to eliminate it**. If you try to suppress or "get rid of" this energy, it will "go underground" - meaning it will find other, potentially more problematic outlets. The energy itself is normal and needs somewhere to go.

## Four-Part Strategy for the Aggressive 4-Year-Old

### 1. Shower with Unrequested Love, Appreciation, and Attention

The word "unrequested" is critical here. **Proactive attention is more meaningful than reactive attention**. This is compared to asking your partner "Do you love me?" - the answer doesn't mean as much when you have to solicit it. The child needs to feel attended to without having to act out to get noticed.

This is especially important for middle children, who can easily get put "on the back burner" when there's an older sibling who is "noticeable" (demanding attention in various ways) and a new baby requiring constant care.

### 2. Set the Limit Clearly: We NEVER Hurt Others

This limit must be communicated "in no uncertain terms" and confronted IMMEDIATELY when violated. There's no ambiguity here - hurting people is non-negotiable. Note the phrasing: the real rule isn't "don't use the sword as a weapon" - it's "we don't ever hurt people." The distinction matters because saying a child can't use a toy sword "as a weapon" creates a logical problem (it is a weapon), but saying we don't hurt people is clear and applicable to any situation.

### 3. Provide Legitimate Outlets for Aggressive Energy

This is the redirection principle in action. Specific suggestions include:

- **Swordfighting with siblings** - if the child can keep it playful and doesn't "get too carried away and want to fight to the death"
- **Physical yard work** - like using the sword to chop weeds
- **Imaginative aggression play** - creating a cardboard "bad guy" so the child can use the sword to protect his siblings from the threat
- **Superhero play with props** - a cape allows the child to "astound you with his courage and ability to leap tall buildings with a single bound"

The goal is giving the aggressive impulses somewhere constructive and approved to go, channeling the energy rather than damming it up.

### 4. Use Small Positive Rewards to Break the Urination Habit

For the inappropriate urination problem specifically, the approach is to give a small positive reward (like a sticker or jelly bean) EVERY time the child pees in the potty. The psychology behind this:

- The child will **want to save up all his pee** for the toilet to get more stickers
- This creates **intrinsic motivation to resist peeing elsewhere** without requiring punishment
- This **only needs to continue for a week or two** until the bad habit is broken
- The reward is short-term scaffolding, not a permanent system

## Understanding Bedwetting Regression in the 7-Year-Old

### Two Possible Causes

**Cause 1: Emotional - Need for Attention**

Just like the younger sibling, the older child may be experiencing distress from the new family structure. The same principle applies: give attention BEFORE the child needs it. Proactive, scheduled attention is the solution.

**Cause 2: Developmental - Deeper Sleep Phase**

As children get older - usually around age 5, but sometimes as late as age 7 - they begin sleeping more deeply. This is a double-edged developmental change:

- **The benefit**: They usually sleep through the night without fail
- **The drawback**: They may begin wetting the bed again because they don't wake up when they need to pee

The child essentially needs to "train themselves to wake up to pee if necessary" - they previously did this automatically, but deeper sleep has disrupted the pattern.

### Interventions for Bedwetting

**First-line approaches:**

- Curtail fluids in the hour before bed
- Pee "one last time" before lights out

**Second-line approach - Bedwetting alarms:**

These devices have two key advantages:

1. **They work fairly quickly**
2. **The child stays in charge of the process**, so there's no power struggle between parent and child

**Optional - Reward chart:**

A small reward chart for staying dry at night can be used. This is especially appropriate if the younger sibling is also getting rewards (for potty use), to avoid jealousy between siblings.

### Critical Warning: Never Scold About Bedwetting

The approach must be "totally matter of fact." A suggested script: **"Soon you'll stay dry all night again. You're already doing better than I did when I was your age."** This normalizes the experience and maintains the child's dignity while expressing confidence in their ability to overcome it.

## The Principle of Scheduled One-on-One Time

When parenting multiple children (especially three), the only reliable way to make each child feel attended to is to **schedule daily time with each child that they can look forward to and depend on**. This predictability is key - the child knows it's coming, which reduces anxiety about getting enough attention.

### Practical Implementation Example

Use nap times strategically:

- During one baby nap: the 7-year-old gets exclusive parent time while the 4-year-old has a "short rest time"
- During the other baby nap: the 4-year-old gets exclusive parent time

This gives each older child "a lifeline" - something dependable to hold onto amid all the chaos and competition for attention.

## The Middle Child Dynamic

Middle children face a unique challenge. They can easily be overlooked when:

- The oldest child is demanding or "noticeable" in various ways
- The baby requires constant care and attention
- Parents must actively "fight the tendency" to put the middle child on a back burner

The acting out behaviors (aggression, inappropriate urination) may be the middle child's way of becoming "noticeable" themselves - of forcing the attention that isn't coming naturally.

## Summary of Core Principles

1. **Proactive attention beats reactive attention** - give love and attention before it's demanded or acted out for
2. **Redirect rather than suppress** - aggressive energy that's blocked will go underground and emerge in worse ways
3. **Use clear, absolute limits for safety** - "We NEVER hurt others" is non-negotiable
4. **Small rewards break bad habits quickly** - they create intrinsic motivation and only need to last a week or two
5. **Schedule dependable one-on-one time** - predictability reduces anxiety about getting enough attention
6. **Approach setbacks matter-of-factly** - never scold about regressions like bedwetting
7. **Consider both emotional and developmental explanations** - the same symptom can have different causes at different ages
