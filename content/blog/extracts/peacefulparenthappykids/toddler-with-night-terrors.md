# Understanding and Managing Night Terrors in Toddlers

## What Night Terrors Are (And How They Differ from Nightmares)

**Night terrors** are fundamentally different from nightmares. Nightmares are upsetting dreams that happen during REM (dream) sleep, meaning the child is actively dreaming and will often remember the content. Night terrors occur during **Stage 4 Deep Sleep**, or during the transition from Stage 4 to REM Sleep. During a night terror, the person is actually asleep according to their brain waves, even if their eyes are open. Most of the time the person has no recollection of the night terror afterward.

This distinction matters because it changes how parents should respond. The child is not experiencing a frightening dream they can be comforted out of. They are in a sleep state that looks like waking terror but is neurologically quite different.

## Who Gets Night Terrors and Why

Night terrors can occur at any age, but small children seem to suffer them most frequently. **Up to 15% of kids** reportedly experience at least one night terror. Scientists believe night terrors may be caused by **over-arousal of the central nervous system**, which regulates brain activity. Most children outgrow them as their brains mature, though some adults report having night terrors when under stress.

There appears to be a **genetic component** to night terrors. Stanford researchers have hypothesized a link between childhood **sleep apnea** and night terrors, making it worthwhile to have a pediatrician check for sleep apnea.

### Known Triggers

Several factors can trigger night terrors in children who are prone to them:

- **Stress** and emotional overwhelm
- **Over-tiredness** and insufficient sleep
- **Physical overwhelm** such as being taken to loud parties or concerts
- **Illness**, particularly mild colds or fevers (based on parent reports, though not formally researched)
- **Being accidentally awakened** during Stage 4 sleep when there is already a predisposition
- **Overheating** during sleep
- **Difficulty breathing** due to inflamed tonsils, allergies, or colds
- **Digestion** (eating close to bedtime)

## Why Night Terrors Are Worth Addressing

Night terrors are apparently not physically dangerous, but they are worth addressing for two important reasons. First, most parents find them utterly terrifying, which creates significant stress for the family. Second, resolving them means everyone gets more sleep.

## Comprehensive Management Strategies

### During a Night Terror

**Keep calm yourself.** The child is likely not remembering these incidents and is not being traumatized by them, even though they appear to be in distress. While the child will probably seem inconsolable, adults who suffer from night terrors report that they have been comforted by the calm, reassuring voices of those they love. If the child will allow hugging, do so. If not, staying close enough to gently touch them without scaring them further may help.

**Do not try to force the child to wake up from a night terror.** Forcing wakefulness leaves a person extremely disoriented, sometimes to the point of temporary amnesia. Let the episode run its course while providing calm presence.

### Reducing Overall Stress

**Minimize stress in the child's life.** Night terrors are related to stress. This means:

- No toilet training or other big developmental challenges if it can be avoided until the child gets out of this phase
- Ensure the child is not exposed to parental loud voices or other emotional stressors
- Use positive discipline approaches
- Avoid physical overwhelm like loud events

### Screen Time

**Eliminate TV.** The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children younger than 24 months should not watch TV because it negatively impacts brain development. Beyond the general developmental concerns, screen time may contribute to the neurological over-arousal associated with night terrors.

### Sleep Optimization

**Prevent over-tiredness.** Over-tiredness may make children more susceptible to night terrors. Ensure a regular bedtime routine and sufficient sleep. One effective method is to move bedtime a bit earlier each night. Children around 22 months often need to be asleep by 7pm. When they stay up later, they have to summon adrenaline and other arousal hormones to keep it together. Moving to an earlier bedtime not only helps them fall asleep more easily at night but also lessens the possibility of neurological over-arousal.

**Adopt a comforting bedtime ritual.** This should include bath, snuggling, and reading, followed consistently each night. The child needs an hour of "wind-down" time that is soothing. During this hour, avoid:

- Music
- TV
- Loudness
- Wildness or anything particularly arousing
- Food (since digestion seems to be the source of night terrors for some people)

**Prevent accidental awakening.** There is evidence that night terrors result from being awakened during Stage 4 sleep if there is already a predisposition. If traffic, TV, or telephone noises intrude on the child's sleep, they could be triggering episodes. A white noise machine may help as a precaution.

**Prevent overheating.** Many parents report that their child is more likely to have night terrors when overheated. Particularly avoid footed pajamas.

### Physical Factors

**Address breathing difficulties.** If the child has allergies or a cold and their tonsils are inflamed, it can make it harder to breathe, which may trigger night terrors. A doctor may recommend using Benadryl until the child is back to normal. Some physicians report that removing the tonsils and adenoids can immediately cure night terrors in cases where they were regularly swollen and the child was having a hard time breathing at night.

**Check for sleep apnea.** Given Stanford's research linking sleep apnea to night terrors, having a pediatrician evaluate for this condition is worthwhile.

### Reducing Anxiety Through Play

**Get the child laughing every day.** Anxiety is mild fear, and all children carry some around because they are tiny powerless people in a big world. Anxiety increases stress, which can trigger night terrors.

Laughter actually reduces stress hormones in the child's bloodstream. While most adults immediately think tickling is the best way to get kids laughing, **tickling is not recommended** because it can make kids feel more powerless (which is counterproductive when trying to reduce anxiety).

**Instead, use physical play or roughhousing** that gets the child laughing by giving them a sense of power:

- Let them push you over
- Chase them around the house
- Other games where the child "wins" or has control

**Timing matters:** Do not do roughhousing right before bedtime or it winds the child up. Do it before dinner or bath, or earlier in the day, so they have a chance to calm down before sleep.

### Resetting the Arousal System

**Consider scheduled awakenings.** There is evidence that you can help a child reset their arousal cycle by waking them gently fifteen minutes before the night terrors usually occur. If you can see a pattern and the night terrors are frequent, this intervention might be worth trying. Doing this for 3 to 5 days will hopefully interrupt the arousal cycle and prevent the night terrors from recurring.

This recommendation comes with reluctance because waking children is generally undesirable, but when night terrors are frequent and follow a predictable pattern, the temporary disruption may break the cycle.

### Safety Precautions

**Keep the child in a crib if possible** until they outgrow their night terrors. Children can easily leap out of bed during a night terror.

**If the child has graduated from a crib:**

- Move anything they could trip on out of the way
- Ensure windows are closed and have a window guard
- Use a baby gate to prevent them from running out of their room and falling down stairs
