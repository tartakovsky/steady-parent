## Core Concepts and Definitions

**Fecal retention** refers to the habit of holding in stools. This is distinct from constipation in that it involves an active behavioral component where the child resists having bowel movements.

**Encopresis** describes the soiling of underwear that typically results from fecal retention. Children who hold their stool eventually have accidents because the pressure becomes too great, or the stool leaks around impacted matter.

## The Vicious Cycle of Fecal Retention

Fecal retention often begins with a single painful bowel movement experience. This creates fear of future pain, which leads to avoidance behavior. The avoidance causes stools to accumulate and become larger and harder, which makes the next bowel movement even more painful. This confirms the child's fear and reinforces the avoidance behavior, creating a self-perpetuating cycle.

The cycle progresses: pain -> fear -> avoidance -> larger stools -> more pain -> greater fear -> stronger avoidance.

This is why early intervention matters. The longer the cycle continues, the more entrenched the physical and psychological components become.

## Reframing the Problem: Physiological, Not Primarily Psychological

**Key insight**: While fecal retention may begin with a psychological trigger (fear of pain, stress, or trauma), it quickly becomes a physiological problem. Parents and practitioners should reframe this as a body problem, not a willpower or behavioral problem.

The reasoning: Children desperately want to solve this issue. They are not being defiant or lazy. Their bodies are genuinely not working properly because:
- Their stools may still hurt regardless of their intention to go
- They may have lost the ability to recognize their own rectal urges
- The colon may have become distended, which makes bowel movements larger and more uncomfortable
- The normal reflex mechanisms have been disrupted

This reframe matters because blaming the child or treating this purely as a behavioral issue misses the actual problem and damages the child's self-esteem. The child's colon is not functioning like a healthy colon does.

## The Miralax Dilemma

Miralax (polyethylene glycol) is commonly prescribed to soften stools and make bowel movements easier. However, there are several important considerations:

**Benefits of Miralax**:
- Keeps stools soft and prevents painful bowel movements
- Does not cause cramps
- Leaves the child in control of when they will move their bowels
- Necessary to break the pain-fear cycle

**Limitations and concerns**:
- It represents a physical dependency that ideally should not be necessary for a child
- It can lead to bowel accidents (overly soft stool that leaks)
- It works for some kids but not for many others
- It can keep families stuck in a bad situation that worsens as the child ages
- Even with Miralax, some children resist going so strongly that they still end up soiling their clothes

**Practical guidance**: Despite concerns, Miralax should be continued (likely for about a year) to ensure bowel movements are soft and painless. The target consistency is approximately like oatmeal. The priority is breaking the pain-fear cycle, which requires preventing any painful experiences.

## The Standard Gentle Approach: Seven Key Recommendations

### 1. Ensure Pain-Free Bowel Movements

Keep the child on stool softeners (Miralax) to maintain soft stools. The goal is that it never hurts to move the bowels. Combine this with a healthy diet including plenty of water, fiber, and good oils.

**Why this matters**: Every painful bowel movement reinforces the fear. Even one painful experience can set back progress significantly. Pain prevention is foundational to all other interventions.

### 2. Keep the Child in Control of Their Own Body

Avoid enemas as long as bowel movements can occur with Miralax. Preserving the child's sense of bodily autonomy is important for psychological reasons and for maintaining trust.

**Why this matters**: Enemas are invasive and remove control from the child. Children who feel out of control of their bodies become more anxious, which can worsen retention. The child being in charge of when they go supports both their self-esteem and their developing body awareness.

### 3. Establish Regular Accompanied Bathroom Sessions

Sit with the child while they are on the toilet at least twice daily, for up to 30 minutes each session. The parent's role is threefold:
- Keep the child company to allay fears about pain
- Help the child relax so they are more likely to have a bowel movement
- Serve as partner, assistant, and cheerleader

**Practical elements**:
- A warm bath before "sits" helps move the bowels
- Have special books, games, or activities that are only available during bathroom time - this makes the experience positive and something to look forward to
- If a bowel movement occurs, celebrate genuinely
- If no bowel movement after 30 minutes, end positively: "Ok, let's take a break, but please tell me when you're ready to come back and try again, ok?"

**Why the time investment**: Building positive associations with bathroom time takes consistent, patient effort. The parent's calm, supportive presence communicates that this is safe and manageable. Special activities transform bathroom time from scary to enjoyable.

### 4. Schedule Bathroom Times Consistently After Meals

Schedule sits at the same times every day, ideally right after meals.

**Why this works**: After eating, the intestines move food through by squeezing (the gastrocolic reflex), which makes it easier to have a bowel movement. Consistent timing also helps establish a reliable habit and trains the body to expect elimination at certain times.

### 5. Teach the Valsalva Maneuver

Teach the child the proper technique for moving bowels:
1. Hold breath
2. Squeeze in abdominal muscles
3. Push hard to push out the stool

**Why this helps**: Many children with retention issues don't know how to coordinate the muscle movements needed for defecation. They may strain incorrectly or not apply enough pressure. The Valsalva maneuver provides a concrete technique they can use.

### 6. Optimize Physical Positioning

Offer the child a choice between a potty chair and the toilet. Consider purchasing a specialized stool that provides:
- Support and security
- Proper leverage for pushing
- Feet firmly planted rather than dangling

**Why positioning matters**: Many children are frightened of falling into the toilet. More importantly, when legs dangle, rectal muscles tighten, which makes defecation difficult. Proper positioning with feet supported allows the child to relax the right muscles and apply pressure effectively.

Even if a potty chair seems small for a 5-year-old, the child's comfort and ability to produce bowel movements takes priority. Transition to a regular toilet can happen after the child has normalized their bowel habits.

### 7. Never Punish Soiling Accidents

When accidents happen, remain calm and respond supportively: "I guess you couldn't make it to the bathroom this time. Soon you will be able to use the bathroom every time. What can I do to help you use the potty instead of your pants?"

**Why punishment backfires**: Punishment leads the child to hide soiled pants and begin lying. This creates additional behavioral problems layered on top of the original issue. It also increases shame and anxiety, which worsens retention.

**Understanding accidents**: Most children with encopresis don't feel their urge to go until they're already in the middle of it. This is a physiological reality, not defiance. The rectal sensation nerves have been affected by chronic distension or the child has learned to suppress the signals.

## Timeline and Escalation Protocol

**One-month trial**: Give the gentle approach above no more than one month to show some change. If positive progress is evident, continue the protocol. Within six months of consistent improvement, the child should have normalized, at which point Miralax can be very gradually weaned.

**Why the timeline matters**: This issue becomes much more difficult to solve once children reach school age. School-age children often:
- Begin to hide their problem
- Have accidents at school (socially devastating)
- Experience eroded self-esteem
- Develop an enlarged colon with reduced sensitivity to urges

Delaying effective intervention makes the problem worse, not better.

## When to Escalate: The Collins Protocol

If no positive progress occurs within one month, more aggressive intervention is warranted.

**First step**: Consult with a gastroenterologist to check for blockage. The child may need a complete clean-out before the gentle program can work.

**The Collins approach** (Dr. Robert Collins): This protocol adds suppositories and enemas to ensure the child moves their bowels regularly:
- Regular bathroom sits twice daily
- If no bowel movement after the first two sits, use a suppository
- If still no bowel movement, use an enema

**The rationale behind seeming invasiveness**: While enemas are invasive and uncomfortable, encopresis left untreated is a severe problem that can traumatize a child for life. The longer it continues, the more traumatic it becomes. The Collins protocol trades short-term invasiveness for faster resolution.

**How the Collins protocol works**: The regular, guaranteed bowel movements retrain the bowel reflexes. Observing families on the Collins discussion forum reveals a typical pattern:
1. Parents begin nervous and uncomfortable with the protocol
2. Within a few weeks, children begin having bowel movements on their own
3. Suppositories and enemas are needed less and less frequently
4. Within a few months, most children are completely off them
5. Children become thrilled and relieved as they regain control of their bodies

**Why it seems to work**: The theory is that regular complete evacuation allows the distended colon to return to normal size and restores normal reflex function. The child's body relearns the proper signals and responses.

**Practical note**: Collins' book costs $75 but includes access to a parent forum. Reading the forum archives before beginning is recommended to understand the approach fully and see real experiences. A lower-cost forum-only access option is available.

## The Standard Medical Approach and Its Limitations

The typical medical approach mirrors the gentle protocol: medical tests to rule out structural issues, keeping stool soft, and hoping the child adjusts to having regular bowel movements.

**The problem**: This approach only works in about half of cases. Doctors often seem stymied by persistent cases, and the issue drags on without resolution. Families can get stuck in an ineffective holding pattern for years.

## The Emotional Dimension: Protecting Self-Esteem and Relationship

Throughout treatment, the child's emotional wellbeing and the parent-child relationship must be protected.

**Unconditional love is essential**: The child needs to feel loved and supported regardless of their bathroom struggles. This love is what will help them get through this with self-esteem intact.

**The goal beyond bowel movements**: Whether using the gentle approach or the Collins protocol, the ultimate goals are:
1. The child can use the toilet normally
2. The child's self-esteem comes out stronger, not damaged
3. The parent-child relationship is strengthened through this challenge, not eroded

**Why this matters for long-term outcomes**: A child who overcomes this problem while feeling supported and loved develops resilience and trust. A child who is shamed, punished, or made to feel defective may achieve physical normalization but carry psychological wounds.

## What NOT to Do

- **Do not punish accidents** - creates hiding, lying, and shame
- **Do not treat this purely as a behavioral/willpower issue** - the body is genuinely not functioning normally
- **Do not wait indefinitely** - the problem worsens with time, especially approaching school age
- **Do not use enemas as a first resort** - preserve the child's sense of bodily control initially
- **Do not ignore the problem hoping it resolves** - the vicious cycle tends to intensify without intervention
- **Do not let painful bowel movements occur** - each one reinforces fear and avoidance

## Summary of the Treatment Decision Tree

1. Start with the gentle seven-point approach for one month
2. If improvement: continue for up to six months, then gradually wean from Miralax
3. If no improvement after one month:
   - Consult gastroenterologist for possible clean-out
   - Consider the Collins protocol with suppositories/enemas
4. Throughout: maintain unconditional love, never punish, protect self-esteem
