# Teaching Toddlers and Preschoolers Emotional Literacy

## Core Principle: Language Precedes Self-Regulation

The fundamental insight is that children need **emotional vocabulary** before they can manage their emotions. The ability to name a feeling is prerequisite to regulating it. This is why we teach children words for their feelings - not as a labeling exercise, but as a self-regulation tool.

**Critical timing insight**: Children need to hear words for approximately **six months** before they can use those words themselves. This means emotional vocabulary instruction must begin far earlier than we expect children to use it. Starting when we first talk to babies is not too early - it is exactly the right time.

## Seven Methods for Teaching Emotional Vocabulary

### 1. Label Emotions Through Empathic Narration (From Infancy)

Begin labeling emotions as early as possible by empathizing with the baby's experience and putting words to it.

**Examples and what they demonstrate**:
- *"Wow! That's cold!"* - Labels a physical sensation that connects to emotional experience
- *"What a big smile! You're happy!"* - Connects observable behavior (smile) to internal state (happiness)
- *"You are so sad, you just need to cry. That's ok, Sweetie, Mom will hold you while you show me those sad feelings."* - Validates negative emotion, communicates acceptance, offers comfort while the emotion runs its course
- *"You are so mad! You don't like it when your brother pushes you. You can tell your brother, 'Don't push me!'"* - Labels anger, identifies cause, models appropriate verbal expression

**Speaking on behalf of the child**: Just as we model social niceties by speaking for our child (*"Josh loves the truck, Auntie, thank you so much!"*), we speak for them emotionally. When a sibling pushes, we might say to the sibling: *"Alexander, do you see Josh's face? He's telling you that he doesn't like it when you push him."* This serves multiple purposes:
- Labels the feeling for the younger child
- Teaches the older child to read emotional cues
- Models verbal communication of feelings
- Validates the hurt child's experience

### 2. "Name That Feeling" Game (Ages 2+)

Make faces at each other and guess what feeling is being expressed.

**Why this works**: It turns emotional recognition into play, making learning enjoyable and repeated. It exercises the skill of reading emotional expressions in others.

**Age consideration**: This requires verbal ability to name feelings, so children typically cannot play until at least age two.

### 3. "If You're Happy and You Know It" with Multiple Emotions

Adapt the familiar song to include many emotional states, each with a corresponding physical action.

**Full example set**:
- *"If you're happy and you know it"* - clap your hands
- *"If you're mad and you know it"* - stomp your foot
- *"If you're sad and you know it"* - cry a tear
- *"If you're hungry and you know it"* - rub your tum
- *"If you're tired and you know it"* - give a yawn
- *"If you're antsy and you know it"* - jump up and down
- *"If you're shy and you know it"* - peek through your hands
- *"If you're silly and you know it"* - giggle and twist
- *"If you're loved and you know it"* - hug your mom or dad

**Why this works (two mechanisms)**:

First, it helps children **identify bodily sensations** that correspond to emotional states. Feelings exist in the body before they exist in words. The physical action helps children connect the label to the internal experience.

Second, it **teaches coping strategies**. You can extend the game to practice healthy emotional expression: *"If you're mad and you know it, dance it out!"* (or blow air out, shake it out, shout it out). This gives children pre-practiced tools for handling big feelings.

**Versatility**: Works for all ages, making it useful as children grow.

### 4. Feelings Play with Stuffed Animals

Use puppets or stuffed animals to act out emotional scenarios. The puppet child expresses a feeling; the puppet parent responds with acceptance and support.

**Why this works**: Children can explore feelings at a safe distance. It is easier to have a stuffed animal say "I'm MAD!" than to say it oneself. The child observes healthy emotional exchange without being the vulnerable one.

**Real example from a three-year-old**: The child, playing with toy trains, said: *"I'm mad at you, Gordon, I'll throw you in the trash!"* Then responded as another character: *"That's ok, Thomas, you can be mad at someone and love them at the same time."*

**What this demonstrates**: The child has internalized that anger does not cancel love - a sophisticated emotional concept. Through play, children process and practice what they have absorbed from their environment.

### 5. Tell Stories About Your Child's Feelings

Narrate past emotional events back to your child, walking through the full sequence of feelings.

**Full example narrative**: *"Jack came to visit and you were so excited to play with him... Then he played with your dump truck and you got worried... Maybe you worried that Jack would take the truck home? But your dump truck lives here with you, it is yours, so no one will take it home. Jack was just enjoying it... You said NO! and you hit Jack, right? You didn't want him to play with it. Then I said 'No hitting!' and I took the dump truck and put it up high, and you cried and cried. I held you and you felt better. Then you and Jack played trains. And then Jack went home, and now you are holding your dump truck and you are so happy to see it, aren't you?"*

**Why this works (two purposes)**:

First, it helps the child **make sense of intense feelings**. Young children experience emotions as overwhelming and confusing. Narrative creates order, causation, and resolution. The child learns that feelings have beginnings, middles, and ends.

Second, it communicates that **all feelings are acceptable**, even when the behavior that resulted from them (hitting) was not. The story distinguishes between the emotion (valid) and the action (not okay). This prevents shame about having feelings while still setting behavioral limits.

### 6. Wonder About Others' Feelings

Comment on the emotional states of others with curiosity, concern, and empathy.

**Examples**:
- *"That little boy is crying.... I wonder why he's sad...."*
- *"That little girl looks so upset..... Oh, I see! Her ice cream fell! She's so disappointed."*
- *"See that boy holding his little sister's hand? I wonder how he feels being a big brother?"*

**Research finding**: When parents "wonder" with toddlers and preschoolers about what an infant sibling is feeling or thinking, the older child treats the baby more kindly **one year later**. The wondering practice appears to develop empathy that translates into prosocial behavior.

**Why this works**: Wondering is open-ended. It invites the child into perspective-taking rather than just delivering information. It models that other people have inner lives worth considering.

**Scope**: Do not limit this to siblings. Any observed emotional experience can become a wondering opportunity.

### 7. Read Books About Feelings

Use picture books that explore emotional themes.

**Specific recommendation**: Aliki's book *Feelings* was a favorite, though 18 months may be too young for it. Many other books exist for toddlers.

**Why books work**: They provide a third-person perspective on emotions, similar to puppet play. Children can observe characters experiencing feelings without personal vulnerability. Books also provide shared vocabulary and repeated exposure to emotional concepts.

## Underlying Principles

**Validation before behavior correction**: Throughout these methods, the pattern is accepting the feeling first, then (if needed) addressing behavior. The child's internal experience is always legitimate, even when their external response needs guidance.

**Modeling over instruction**: Children learn emotional language the same way they learn all language - by hearing it used meaningfully in context. We do not quiz them on emotions; we narrate emotional life around them.

**Repetition creates readiness**: The six-month language absorption window means patience is required. Children are learning even when they cannot yet demonstrate it.

**Body-feeling connection**: Multiple methods (the song, labeling sensations like "cold") emphasize that emotions are physical experiences. This grounds abstract emotional concepts in concrete bodily awareness.

**Safety through distance**: Puppet play, stories, books, and wondering about others all allow children to engage with emotions at a comfortable remove before applying understanding to their own intense experiences.
