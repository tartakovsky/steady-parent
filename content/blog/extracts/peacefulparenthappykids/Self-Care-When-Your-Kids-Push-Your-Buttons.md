## The Nature of Parental Anger and Being Triggered

### Why Anger Causes Loss of Perspective

Anger's defining characteristic is that it makes us lose perspective. When angry, the brain perceives a need to protect against some threat. This shifts us into a defensive, reactive mode where we forget crucial realities:

- A misbehaving child is not an actual threat - they are simply a confused or upset young human with an immature brain
- Acting in a threatening way ourselves escalates the drama rather than resolving it
- Our responsibility as parents is to act like grown-ups, calmly coaching our children so they can learn, grow, and develop emotional and behavioral self-regulation

### Understanding What "Triggered" Means

**Being triggered** means that old feelings are stirred up, causing an over-reaction to the present situation. This sends you into a state of emergency response - fight, flight, or (if those don't resolve the perceived threat) freeze.

When triggered, you lose access to two critical faculties:
1. Compassion
2. Rational thinking

This is why actions taken from a state of fear and anger never produce the desired result. The actual goal - for your child to learn and grow - only happens when a child feels safe and connected. Fear-based parenting creates neither safety nor connection.

### The Feeling of Emergency is Deceptive

When triggered, you feel like you're in an emergency that demands immediate action. You feel driven to act. This sense of urgency is itself part of the problem - it's the fight-or-flight response pushing you toward reactive behavior rather than thoughtful parenting.

## The Core Principle: Resist Acting When Triggered

This is the most important thing to remember about anger: **resist acting when you're triggered**.

This is difficult precisely because the triggered state makes you feel that action is necessary and urgent. But this is exactly when action will backfire.

## When Frequent Anger Signals a Need for Self-Work

Getting angry often is a message that you need to do work on yourself. This reframing is important: no one ever really "triggers" you externally. They are your triggers, stemming from:

- Current stress
- Your own childhood experiences
- Other life traumas

Your child is not creating these triggers - they are simply unearthing triggers that already exist within you. In doing so, children offer the opportunity to heal these wounds.

### Children as Teachers

Life delivers lessons we didn't ask for but which help us develop greater wholeness. When we resist these lessons, they keep appearing - often with increasing force - until we finally address them. Children, who trigger our deepest emotions, frequently serve as our greatest teachers in this regard.

## The Three-Step Framework for Using Anger Constructively

### Step 1: Make a Pre-Commitment to Learning Instead of Reacting

Commit in advance - before the next triggering moment - to use anger as a learning opportunity rather than acting on it. This pre-commitment matters because:

- Next time you slide into fight-or-flight mode and your child appears to be the enemy, you will have already decided to move away from your child
- Having made the decision in advance makes it possible to execute in the moment
- The first step of anger management is always creating distance from the trigger

The reassurance: this gets easier every time you do it. Each successful pause builds neural pathways for better self-regulation - you are literally re-wiring your brain through practice.

### Step 2: Hit the Pause Button When Anger Arises

The specific sequence when you get angry:

1. **Stop** - halt whatever you're doing
2. **Drop** - release your agenda (just for now, temporarily)
3. **Breathe** - conscious breathing interrupts the stress response

Then:
- Shift attention away from your child
- Physically move away
- Turn your attention inward
- Notice where the anger resides in your body
- Breathe into that physical sensation
- Hold yourself with compassion

**What to expect physically**: This process won't feel good. You might feel like you're going to hyperventilate or even vomit. These intense physical sensations are normal when processing difficult emotions without acting on them.

**Why this works**: Every time you can breathe through that unbearable feeling without lashing out, you're emptying your "emotional backpack." This reduces future triggering - you won't get triggered as easily because you've processed and released some of the stored emotional charge.

### Step 3: Empower Yourself Through Deeper Work

When you start feeling stuck about some issue with your child, shift focus:

- Stop focusing on your child's behavior
- Start focusing on your own reaction

**Specific practices for self-exploration**:

1. **Journaling** - write to process your feelings and reactions
2. **Venting to another parent** - with an important guideline: focus on your feelings rather than your child's behavior, so you can access the deeper tears and fears beneath your anger
3. **Exploring childhood connections** - ask yourself how this issue connects to your own childhood experiences
4. **Examining contributing factors** - how is past trauma or current stress playing a role?
5. **Action planning** - what can you do to make things different?

**The mechanism**: As you hold yourself with compassion, notice the physiological sensations of your emotions, and breathe through them without taking action, you release the stuck places in yourself. This process unplugs you emotionally from the drama with your child.

## The Paradox of Child Behavior Change

**Key observation**: When parents work on their part of a conflict, the child's problematic behavior diminishes - even though the child appeared to be creating the problem.

Multiple possible explanations for why this works:

1. **Better limit-setting**: Once at peace with the issue, parents can set firm but kind limits and help the child with emotions instead of adding fuel to the fire
2. **Increased capacity for unconditional love**: When we love ourselves more, we can give our child the unconditional love and safety they need
3. **Spiritual relationship**: Children may bring us exactly the issues we need to heal within ourselves
4. **Removing resistance**: Once we stop pushing our children to be different, they're free to stop resisting and can begin to change

Regardless of which mechanism is at play (or if all are operating together): when we melt the tangle in ourselves, our child often makes a breakthrough too. Both parent and child heal and grow together.

## The Reframe: From "Losing It" to "Using It"

The fundamental mindset shift: when triggered by your child, don't "lose it" - use it. Your child's button-pushing behavior is an opportunity to de-activate those buttons (the buttons, not the child).

The article suggests even expressing gratitude (at least mentally) to your child as your "little Zen master" - the one who reveals what you need to work on.

## Warning: The Scary Parent Face

Parents often don't realize how frightening their angry faces appear to children. The visual impact of parental anger on a child is typically far more intense than parents perceive from inside their own experience. This disconnect between how we feel and how we appear when angry is part of why maintaining awareness during triggering moments matters so much.
