# Optimal Age and Approach for Starting Daycare

## Core Thesis

The decision about when to start daycare should be driven primarily by the individual child's temperament and needs, not by social pressure or arbitrary age milestones. Two years old is developmentally early for group care, and while some children thrive in short periods of group settings, many find it stressful in ways that may not be immediately visible to parents or caregivers.

## Key Developmental Principles

### Emotional Development Comes from Parent Interaction

Children are not "behind" emotionally if they delay daycare. The opposite is true: emotional development stems from interaction with parents, so children who wait will actually be **ahead emotionally**. Social skills similarly do not require early daycare. Children will not be behind socially if they wait three months, six months, or even a year, provided they have other social experiences during that time. Social experiences that include the parent present are especially valuable because parental presence facilitates the development of social skills.

### Toddlers Are Not Biologically Designed for Extended Separation

In tribal situations, two-year-olds do go off with bigger kids for an hour at a time and love it. But when they need refueling, emotionally or physically, they return to the parent. Parents serve as the child's **"North Star"** around which they orient, their **attachment object**. Other children are never an appropriate attachment object, which explains why teenagers who orient around peer groups have such difficult times.

### The Attachment Transfer Problem

Can daycare workers serve as substitute attachment objects? Yes, and this transfer is the only mechanism that allows kids to function without parents during school hours. Children temporarily "transfer" their attachment focus from parents to teachers. However, the attachment relationship teachers provide is typically not a **secure attachment** because of:
- Competing demands for their attention from other children
- Lack of permanence in the child's life (staff turnover, absences)

## Research Findings on Daycare

### Age of Starting Matters

The earlier kids start daycare, the harder it is on them. Studies showing better daycare outcomes, like the **Norway study**, involved children who did not begin daycare until approximately one year of age. This is possible in Norway because of paid parental leave policies.

### Quality and Relationship with Caregivers Make a Significant Difference

There is encouraging research on the positive impact of high-quality care and strong caregiver relationships.

### Duration of Daily Care Matters

Children younger than 36 months often find being at daycare all day to be stressful. This is measurable: their cortisol levels become elevated compared to kids who are at home during the day. A meta-analysis of daycare studies confirmed this conclusion.

### Genetic Predisposition Affects Stress Response

Research by Tucker-Drob et al. (2013) shows that genetic differences impact which kids are more stressed in daycare. Many children do fine, while others are inherently more stressed by the same environment.

### The Cortisol Evidence

The prevailing theory about why school is hard on little ones is that they don't have one caregiver who is always responsive to their needs. Children with a one-on-one caregiver at home don't have elevated cortisol. Even very good schools that designate a specific caregiver for three or four toddlers (which is rare; the US norm is about six toddlers per worker) cannot provide sole availability to any one child. The caregiver will inevitably have sick days or days off. Simply sharing a caregiver with many same-age children is stressful because that person cannot respond only to your child's needs, whether that need is:
- A snuggle when tired
- Help navigating a playground dispute
- Getting a drink when thirsty
- Delaying the next scheduled activity because he wants to watch a worm on the sidewalk

## Warning Signs That Daycare Is Too Stressful

### The "Holding It Together" Pattern

Sometimes a child holds it together in the group setting but bursts into tears the moment a parent appears to pick them up. This behavior indicates it was hard for the child to be in school during that time. While the child seemed fine to teachers (meaning he did not create problems), he actually had:
- Soaring heart rate
- High levels of cortisol and other stress hormones

Now that the parent has returned, the child feels safe to cry and discharge all that stress. **If your child shows this behavior, you may want to avoid having him in a group without you there until he is a bit older.**

### Other Stress Compensation Behaviors

Many two-year-olds who start school begin compensating for stress in other ways that are not always recognized as stress-related:
- Regression in developmental milestones
- Hitting siblings
- Bad dreams
- Increased clinginess

We often don't see these as connected to daycare because we don't want to see it.

## What Makes Group Settings Stressful for Two-Year-Olds

Group care at age two is a modern idea that does not necessarily account for little ones' needs, since it is designed for the needs of adults who must work. The specific stressors include:
- Sensory overload
- Noise levels
- Difficulty making their needs known to caregivers
- Competition for toys
- Necessity of accommodating their own needs to a fixed schedule

## Factors That Determine Individual Tolerance

Two factors primarily determine how stressed a particular child will be:

1. **The child's own sensory processing and temperament**, including how much time they prefer alone versus in groups
2. **Whether the child feels there is an adult available to help them navigate the new environment**

### How to Assess Your Child's Readiness

You will know if your child is suited to group experiences because:
- They will crave outings where there will be other kids
- They will navigate those situations well
- They will always be asking to see other kids

If your child is easily comfortable in groups, then short periods will be stimulating and they will cope with parental absence. If not, waiting until the child is older is advisable.

## The Social Skills Myth

### Daycare Is Overrated for Social Learning

Daycare centers do teach kids something about how to cope socially through experience. However, children can learn those same skills in playgroups where the parent is present. Having the parent there to:
- Give the child language for what's happening
- Help them learn prosocial solutions

is actually **more helpful** in learning prosocial skills than throwing the child into a group situation without a designated caregiver. The alternative approach is essentially "sink or swim."

### Specific Example of Parent-Guided Social Learning

When two children both want the same truck, a parent can say: *"You want the truck and Ilan wants the truck. Two kids and one truck! How can we work this out?"* Then help the child learn: *"Ilan has the truck now, and you will have the truck next. I will help you wait. Do you want to make a road with the plow while we wait for the truck?"*

### Empathy as the Core Social Skill

**Empathy is the most important social skill**, according to research. The development of empathy comes from being treated empathically. There is no way a daycare worker will be able to see things from your child's point of view as well as a parent can, or offer the empathy a parent can. Therefore, the most important social skill is taught by parents, not in school group situations.

## The Academic Myth

### Group Settings Do Not Enhance Cognitive Development

Do kids get something fantastic academically out of group settings? No. What actually makes for high IQ is having a parent who:
- Will stop to watch the worm on the sidewalk
- Will let the child move through their day at their own pace

Group situations may expose kids to more things than parents would, but this is **"sophistication"** which is easy to catch up with later. It is not the actual ability to think, which develops more quickly one-on-one with a parent.

### What About Enriching School Experiences?

There are wonderful learning experiences in school, including Montessori manipulatives and books. But parents can provide those things at home or at children's museums without the downside of separation.

## When Daycare May Be Beneficial

### The Sibling Exception

Dr. Laura actually recommends daycare if a sibling is expected, because it gives the child a world of their own, a bigger world. Without this, the child is confined to a world where suddenly an interloper (the baby) dominates and is always at the center. Having their own separate sphere helps the older child cope.

### Children Who Genuinely Thrive

Some kids LOVE the group experience and thrive on it for a few hours a day. The upside for these children is real stimulation and enjoyment.

## Practical Recommendations

### Ideal Timing

- Delay the start of daycare at least until 12 months
- Preferably delay full-time care until age four

### Ideal Family Work Arrangement

As **Stanley Greenspan**, noted US researcher and author on child development, suggests: if two parents each work 2/3 time, they can each be with the child 1/3 time. The last 1/3 of the child's time can be with a caregiver at home, which is much less stressful than a daycare center.

### Duration Matters

When care is for only three hours a day, it is manageable for most kids, so the stakes are lower than all-day care.

### Alternative Social Experiences to Consider

If keeping a child home, ensure they have:
- Playgroups where the parent is present
- Informal gatherings at the park
- "Mommy/Daddy and Me" classes for music, swimming, or other activities
- Friends coming over in the afternoon after they get out of school (a few days a week is plenty of social play)
- Weekly library trips

Non-social but IQ-expanding experiences with the parent:
- Going to the store
- Gardening
- Museum visits
- Market trips

This can be thought of as "home schooling" for the year.

## The Broader Context

### Parent Stress Affects the Relationship

Parents of young children who also work outside the home are often terrifically stressed and exhausted. This affects the parent-child relationship entirely apart from any daycare considerations.

### We Justify What We Need to Do

We justify childcare as good for kids socially or academically, but it is not actually good academically and it is overrated socially. The reality is that daycare is designed for the needs of adults who need to work, not for the developmental needs of two-year-olds.

### The Finances and Policy Reality

Work situations and finances rarely allow the ideal arrangement, but we should all be fighting for policies that make it possible.

## Application to the Original Question

The parent asking the question had these specific circumstances:
- Child approaching age two
- 80-90% of peers already in preschool/daycare
- Option A: Half-day morning care with afternoon nap at home
- Option B: Keep home except for 2-3 afternoons when parent teaches

Given that the child will be away from the parent 2-3 afternoons a week regardless of the decision, Dr. Laura's recommendation was to have the child stay home another year. She notes this recommendation is influenced by her own experience: her children did not crave the group experience.

The key question for this family: Given that most peers are in school, are there playgroups available to join where the parent will be present? What do the other 10% of families whose children are not in school do? Finding that community is essential if choosing to delay.
