## Core Position on Gendered Parenting Expectations

The expectation that women must be the ones to sacrifice professional aspirations to stay home with children is **patently unfair**. This is not a statement about whether children benefit from parental presence - it is a statement about who bears that burden. The underlying premise that childcare is inherently a mother's responsibility is rejected.

## The Fundamental Tension

Two truths exist simultaneously:
1. Young children benefit tremendously from having parents with them most of the time
2. It is unfair for women to be the default choice for giving up careers

The solution is not to dismiss either truth, but to find arrangements that honor both.

## Children's Needs

Young children benefit from:
- Having parents with them most of the time (not necessarily one parent exclusively)
- Having **two parents who are completely involved in their lives** - not one primary caregiver and one who is peripherally engaged

The emphasis on "two parents completely involved" is key. The goal is not simply parental presence, but engaged presence from both parents. This reframes the question from "which parent stays home" to "how can both parents be maximally involved."

## Practical Solutions

### The 4/3 Solution (Stanley Greenspan's Framework)

**Stanley Greenspan**, author of "The 4/3 Solution," proposes that **both parents work 2/3 time** when their children are young. This allows:
- Parents to provide most of the care for their children themselves
- Both parents to maintain professional engagement
- Neither parent to fully sacrifice their career
- Children to have substantial time with both parents

The fraction is specific: 2/3 time means approximately 26-27 hours per week of work, leaving significant time for childcare while maintaining professional presence.

### Alternating Primary Caregiver Model

When reduced hours for both parents is not possible, many families find success with **switching who stays home**. The arrangement works year by year:
- One year Mom is the stay-at-home parent
- Another year Dad is the stay-at-home parent

This approach:
- Distributes the career impact more equitably
- Gives children deep time with each parent
- Prevents one parent from becoming the "default" caregiver long-term
- Allows each parent periods of professional focus and periods of caregiving focus

## Implicit Assumptions Worth Noting

The response assumes:
- Both parents have some flexibility in their work arrangements
- The family can manage financially on reduced income or alternating single income
- Both parents are willing and capable of being primary caregivers
- Professional aspirations matter for both parents

The advice does not address situations where these assumptions do not hold, such as single-income families where one job cannot be reduced, or where one parent's income is dramatically higher than the other's.
