# Addressing Poop Play in Older Children

## Understanding Why This Happens

**Poop play is normal for toddlers** because they have not yet developed the typical disgust reaction that adults and older children have. However, it is unusual for a six-year-old to engage in this behavior.

The key insight: **Children who continue this behavior at older ages are usually seeking sensory input.** This is not about defiance or misbehavior - it is about an unmet sensory need that the child is trying to fulfill through whatever means are available.

## Core Approach: Meeting the Underlying Need

The fundamental strategy is not to stop the behavior through punishment or control, but to address the sensory need driving it. Once the need is met through appropriate channels, the inappropriate behavior naturally decreases.

## Five-Part Strategy

### 1. Don't Overreact

**Why this matters:** Overreacting creates a power struggle dynamic. If the parent shows intense emotion (anger, disgust, frustration), the child may begin using the behavior as a control mechanism. This transforms a sensory-seeking behavior into a relationship battleground.

**What to do instead:**
- Remind yourself this will not last forever (it won't)
- Use calm, matter-of-fact language: "Poop is not for playing. Let's clean this up and then you can play with your playdoh."
- **Never punish** - punishment guarantees an endless power struggle

The redirection to playdoh is strategic: it immediately offers an alternative sensory experience that meets the same need.

### 2. Supervise During Vulnerable Times

**Practical prevention:** Identify the times of day when the child typically has bowel movements and ensure adult presence during these windows. This is not about surveillance or control - it is about being available to redirect before the behavior starts.

### 3. Create Abundant Sensory Opportunities

**This is the core intervention.** The child's hands need regular sensory input. Provide multiple daily opportunities for appropriate sensory play:

- **Playdoh** - daily use recommended
- **Finger paints**
- **Silly putty**
- **Goop** (homemade slime-like substance)
- **Making cookies** - specifically mixing the dough by hand (the tactile experience, not just baking)
- **Mudpies outside**
- **Sensory bags and bins** - various textures contained in bags or bins for exploration

The variety matters because different textures provide different sensory experiences. A child might need a specific type of input that only certain materials provide.

### 4. Address High Energy Through Physical Play

**Connection between energy and behavior:** One reason children engage in this behavior is excess energy without adequate outlet. The body needs to discharge energy, and if appropriate outlets are not available, inappropriate ones may emerge.

**Daily roughhousing** is specifically recommended - physical play that gets the child laughing with the parent. This serves dual purposes:
1. Discharges physical energy
2. Provides connection and bonding

**Pay attention to energy levels:** Some days the child will have noticeably more energy than others. These high-energy days require extra physical play opportunities.

**Full-body sensory activities:**
- Bear hugs (deep pressure input)
- Rolling over and over together
- Other games involving whole-body contact

**For sensory-seeking children specifically:**
- Some children love being gently brushed with a brush
- Other sensory activities found on websites related to sensory issues
- **Trampoline** - provides both energy outlet and proprioceptive input
- **Spinning seat** - specifically mentioned as beneficial for some sensory-seeking children

### 5. Consider Probiotics

**Speculative but worth trying:** Some parents report that **probiotics that change the gut chemistry** eliminate the child's drive to engage in this behavior.

Dr. Laura notes she cannot confirm this works but considers it worth attempting given that probiotics are generally beneficial and the potential upside is significant.

## Key Principles Embedded in This Approach

**Behavior is communication:** The child is not being bad - they are expressing an unmet need through the only means they have found.

**Prevention over punishment:** The strategy focuses on preventing the behavior by meeting needs, not on punishing after it occurs.

**Connection is part of the solution:** Roughhousing and physical play are recommended specifically as bonding activities (laughing together, rolling together), not just energy discharge.

**Multiple interventions simultaneously:** This is not an either/or approach. All five strategies work together - emotional regulation (don't overreact), practical prevention (supervision), sensory alternatives (craft materials), physical outlet (roughhousing), and biological intervention (probiotics).

## What Not to Do

- **Do not punish.** This creates power struggles and shifts the dynamic from "child has sensory need" to "child and parent are in conflict."
- **Do not overreact emotionally.** Strong reactions can reinforce the behavior or turn it into an attention-seeking mechanism.
- **Do not leave the child unsupervised during likely poop times.** Prevention is easier than intervention after the fact.
