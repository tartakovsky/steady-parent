# When You Can't Get Through to Your Child: Rebuilding Connection and Influence

## Core Insight: The Reversal Principle

The central insight is a reversal of perspective: **when you can't get through to your child, it's because your child feels they can't get through to you**. Children shut parents out when they believe the parent isn't listening, wouldn't understand, or doesn't care about what matters to them. This creates a symmetry - the communication breakdown flows both directions, but the repair starts with the parent.

Why should children listen when they don't feel heard? This question captures the essence of the problem. Children's willingness to be influenced depends entirely on whether they feel understood.

## The Foundation: Connection Enables Influence

Children naturally look to parents for love, protection, and guidance, but only as long as they feel warmly connected. This is the biological baseline - children are wired to seek parental guidance. When that seeking stops, something has disrupted the connection.

**You cannot control another human being** - this is stated as an absolute truth about parenting. However, as long as you have a good relationship with your child, you have influence. The distinction between control and influence is critical: control is impossible, but influence is achievable through relationship quality.

As children develop, they naturally want to explore the world and learn for themselves. This is healthy. The problem isn't that children want autonomy - it's when they're willing to risk their relationship with you to get what they want. That willingness to sacrifice relationship signals the relationship needs strengthening.

## Why Children Stop Seeking Parental Guidance

Children begin to disconnect when they conclude that:
- The parent isn't listening
- The parent wouldn't understand
- The parent doesn't care about what matters to them

This doesn't necessarily mean the parent has done something wrong. It might mean the child is **strong-willed and an experiential learner** who wants to do what they want regardless of parental preferences. But even in this case, the child's willingness to risk the relationship for autonomy indicates the relationship needs work.

## The Cure: Strengthen and Sweeten the Relationship

Stephen Covey's principle applies: **"Seek first to understand."** This is the cure for losing influence with your child.

Importantly, strengthening the relationship does NOT mean saying yes to whatever your child wants. The relationship's strength depends on whether the child trusts you to:
1. Understand their perspective
2. Believe in them
3. Be on their side, no matter what

These three elements - understanding, belief, and unconditional support - form the foundation of influence.

## Five Questions That Define Relationship Quality

Each question represents a dimension of connection, with specific outcomes when practiced:

### 1. Are you willing to listen and see things from your child's perspective?
**Outcome**: The child learns they don't get everything they want, but they get a parent who understands, no matter what. The distinction is crucial - they may not get the thing, but they get the understanding. This substitution works because understanding itself is valuable to children.

### 2. Can you set limits with empathy?
This means offering understanding of what the child wants and why, even when you can't say yes. **Outcome**: The child feels understood even when they don't get what they want, so they accept limits more readily. The mechanism is that empathy during limit-setting prevents the child from feeling dismissed or unseen, which makes the limit less threatening to accept.

### 3. Are you looking for win-win solutions?
The alternative framing: do you insist on being right? Insisting on being right means someone else has to be wrong. **Outcome**: The child learns that in a relationship, we try to make it work for both people. This models collaborative problem-solving rather than dominance hierarchy.

### 4. Can you tolerate your child's disappointment, sadness, and anger?
The alternative: do they need to hide their deepest upsets from you? **Outcome**: The child learns to accept their own emotions, which helps them learn to regulate them. The chain here is: parental tolerance -> child's self-acceptance -> emotional regulation. Children cannot learn to regulate emotions they must hide.

### 5. When you look at your child, do you see mostly positives, no matter what they've done wrong?
**Outcome**: The child learns to see themselves as good, even when they make mistakes - which means they're more likely to "do good." This creates a positive identity cycle where self-perception as good motivates good behavior.

## The Safety Mechanism

**Our intention to understand is what helps our child feel safe enough to accept our guidance.** This connects understanding to safety to receptiveness in a causal chain.

A key universal principle: **None of us ever change except from a place of safety.** This applies to adults and children alike. Change requires safety first. If a child doesn't feel safe with you (emotionally safe, meaning they won't be judged, dismissed, or attacked), they cannot be open to your influence.

## The Challenge of Self-Regulation

Extending understanding is difficult when you're upset. The solution has two parts:
1. **Calm yourself** before engaging
2. **Get clear on your positive intention** before you open your mouth

Your child may not know what words are going through your mind, but **they will always feel your intention**. This means the internal state matters as much as or more than the words spoken. Children are reading intention directly, not just processing language.

## Reframing the Parent-Child Dynamic

Life with children can sometimes feel like a battle, but **children are never the enemy**. This reframe is essential for maintaining the right stance.

Yes, parents are responsible for teaching children to act right. But **kids don't act right when we see them as "wrong."** This creates a paradox: the more you focus on what's wrong with your child, the less they will behave well.

The solution: **Hold onto a vision of your child's best self for your child to act as that self.** You need to see and believe in who they can be, not fixate on what they're currently doing wrong. Your vision of them shapes their behavior.

If you can manage your own emotions, you can find the good will and emotional generosity to see your child's perspective. The chain is: emotional self-management -> good will -> perspective-taking capacity.

## Understanding vs. Agreement

Seeing your child's perspective doesn't mean agreeing with their behavior. The distinction is crucial. You can simultaneously:
- See that your child is struggling
- Want to help them feel better so they can do better
- Set limits on behavior

These are not contradictory. Understanding the child's inner experience is separate from approving their external actions.

**"Feel better, do better"** - this captures the mechanism. When children feel understood and supported (feel better), they have the emotional resources to behave appropriately (do better). Behavior follows emotional state.

## The Shift That Changes Everything

Once your child feels you're on their side, rather than out to control them, everything can shift. The transformation can be dramatic - **you may not even have to say a word to get your child to listen.**

This is because children who feel genuinely understood and supported naturally orient toward their parents. The influence becomes effortless once the relational foundation is solid.

## The Communication Principle (from Marianne Williamson)

**"The key to communication is not what we say, but rather the attitude that lies behind what we say."**

The deeper truth: **"All of us are telepathically communicating all the time."** Every moment, we are choosing to join or to separate, and the person we're speaking to feels what we have chosen, regardless of our words.

This means:
- Words are secondary to intention and attitude
- The choice to join or separate is felt directly by the child
- You cannot hide your true stance behind good words - it will be perceived

## Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Insisting on being right** - this creates winners and losers, damaging connection
2. **Seeing your child as "wrong"** - this prevents them from acting right
3. **Making children hide their emotions** - this prevents emotional regulation development
4. **Trying to control rather than influence** - control is impossible and damages relationship
5. **Speaking before calming and clarifying intention** - children read intention beneath words
6. **Focusing on behavior without addressing underlying emotional state** - behavior follows feelings

## The Complete Chain of Influence

Parent calms self -> Parent clarifies positive intention -> Child senses intention -> Child feels safe -> Child feels understood -> Child accepts guidance -> Relationship strengthens -> Future influence increases

This is a virtuous cycle when working well, but it starts with parental self-regulation and intention-setting, not with trying to change the child's behavior directly.
