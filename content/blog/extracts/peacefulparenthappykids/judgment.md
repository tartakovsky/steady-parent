## Core Principle: Good Judgment Develops Through Experience Plus Reflection

No one is born with good judgment or the ability to make wise decisions. Good judgment and decision-making skills develop specifically from the combination of two elements: experience making decisions and reflection on those decisions afterward. As expressed in the article: "Judgment develops from experience. Good judgment develops from bad experience."

This means that protecting children from making decisions, or from making bad decisions, actually prevents the development of good judgment. The bad decisions themselves become raw material for learning when paired with reflection.

**The parental goal is twofold:**
1. Give children experience in making decisions
2. Ensure they have opportunity to reflect on those decisions and learn from them

There is an additional foundational element: raising children who feel good about themselves. This matters because research shows that kids who have been treated less than kindly get accustomed to feeling bad. As teens and adults, they then make decisions that make them feel bad. In other words, self-worth influences decision quality because people tend to make choices consistent with how they believe they deserve to feel.

## Strategy 1: Start Early with Practice

**Begin giving children practice making choices before they can even talk.** This early start means they will never struggle with indecision later. The article emphasizes that practice truly does make perfect when it comes to decision-making.

**Key mindset shift for parents:** Let go of caring about what others think of your parenting when your child makes choices that seem strange or mismatched. If a child chooses clashing stripes and flowers because "she thinks she looks like a rainbow," that's the point. The child is exercising decision-making muscles, not optimizing for aesthetics.

The underlying logic: Decision-making is a skill that strengthens with use. Children who make hundreds of small decisions about clothes, food preferences, and activities develop confidence and competence in making decisions. This foundation supports bigger decisions later.

## Strategy 2: Define Clear Boundaries of Control

Children need to understand which decisions belong to them and which remain with parents. This clarity prevents power struggles and teaches that decision-making exists within appropriate constraints.

**Framework: Explicitly communicate what the child controls versus what the parent controls.**

### Example with Toddlers

The parent says: "Yes, I guess you may wear your superman outfit again, although you've worn it every day this week. You're in charge of choosing your own clothes. But you'll need to change before we go to services, because there we dress up to show respect. And you'll need to brush your teeth. Do you want to do it now or before we leave the house?"

**What this example demonstrates:**
- Acknowledges the child's domain of control (choosing clothes for regular activities)
- Explains the exception and the reason behind it (dressing up for services shows respect)
- Presents a choice within the non-negotiable area (when to brush teeth, not whether)
- Uses language that reinforces the child's ownership: "You're in charge of..."

### Example with Preteens

The parent says: "You can invite your friends for Friday night dinner if you want, but you're expected to have dinner with the family on Friday night as usual. You can either go to the movies with your friends after dinner on Friday, or on Saturday."

**What this example demonstrates:**
- Flexibility within structure (friends can come to family dinner)
- Non-negotiable family expectations are stated clearly (dinner together happens)
- Multiple acceptable options are offered (movies Friday after dinner OR Saturday)
- The child has real choice while family values are maintained

## Strategy 3: Facilitate Conscious Reflection

Many people never develop good judgment specifically because their experience is not accompanied by reflection. This is the critical distinction. Experience alone is insufficient; it must be paired with deliberate thinking about decisions and their outcomes.

**Three phases of reflection to support:**

### Before the Decision: Help Children Make Decisions Consciously

Ask questions that surface their thinking process: "How will you decide what piece to play for the recital?"

This question does several things:
- Signals that there IS a decision to be made (not just defaulting)
- Implies the child is capable of making it
- Creates space for the child to articulate their own criteria

### During the Consideration: Help Them Think Through Repercussions

Example prompt: "I wonder if you'll feel too pressured about getting your homework done if you choose such a hard piece to master."

**Notice the framing:** "I wonder if..." rather than "You will feel pressured." This keeps the child in the driver's seat of their own thinking rather than imposing the parent's conclusion. It models considering downstream consequences without dictating the "right" answer.

### After the Decision: Reflect on How It Worked Out

Example: "I know you worked hard preparing for the recital. Are you glad you chose that music?"

This post-decision reflection closes the learning loop. The child connects their choice to the actual outcome they experienced. This is where the "bad experience" mentioned in the core principle gets transformed into good judgment.

## Strategy 4: Model Decision-Making Aloud

Parents should share how and why they make decisions starting from when the child is tiny. This gives children a template for what decision-making sounds like internally.

**Examples of modeling decision-making out loud:**

- "I think I'll bring an umbrella on our walk. It looks like rain." (Demonstrates: observing conditions and preparing for likely outcomes)

- "I'm going to try the salmon; it's really good for you, and delicious!" (Demonstrates: weighing multiple criteria, in this case health and pleasure)

- "I'd like our family to help with the drive for school supplies; all children deserve a good education, and this is one way to help." (Demonstrates: connecting actions to values, seeing contribution opportunities)

**Why this works:** Children cannot see the invisible mental process of adult decision-making unless it is made explicit. By narrating decisions out loud, parents reveal that choices are deliberate, that reasons exist, and that different factors get weighed against each other.

## Strategy 5: Expand Control as Age-Appropriate

As children mature, they should receive increasing control over their own decision-making. This is a gradual transfer of authority, not an all-at-once handover at some arbitrary age.

The article references a separate resource on age-appropriate responsibilities, indicating that specific guidance exists for what decisions children can handle at different developmental stages.

**The principle:** Match decision-making latitude to developmental readiness. Too little latitude stunts judgment development. Too much latitude before readiness can lead to harmful outcomes without the maturity to learn constructively from them.

## Strategy 6: Expect Bad Decisions and Use Them Constructively

**Critical reframe:** Bad decisions are not failures of parenting or character flaws in the child. They are learning opportunities. Children are simultaneously learning about themselves and about life, so missteps are inevitable and valuable.

**The key condition:** Bad decisions only become opportunities for developing good judgment when parents help children reflect on how things could have been different with different choices.

### How to Handle Bad Decisions

**Ask questions rather than lecture.** This approach matters because questioning helps the child discover for themselves what they wish they had done. Lecturing triggers defensiveness about what the parent thinks they should have done. Self-discovered insights stick; imposed lessons get rejected.

**Questions to ask after a poor decision:**

1. "Is there some part of you that thought maybe that wasn't such a good idea?"
   - This question acknowledges that children often have internal warning signals they override. It validates their intuition and helps them learn to trust it.

2. "What kept you from listening to that part of yourself?"
   - This explores the interference factors: peer pressure, impulsivity, desire, etc. Understanding what blocked their better judgment helps them resist those factors next time.

3. "I wonder what you could do now to make things better?"
   - This shifts from regret to repair. It teaches that mistakes can be addressed rather than just endured.

### Special Note for Teens

Teenagers need more decision-making latitude than younger children. This increased latitude mathematically means more bad decisions will occur. Parents must resist the "universal impulse" to say "I told you so." When parents avoid this phrase, teens actually learn from their mistakes. When parents use it, defensiveness blocks learning.

## What to Avoid

**Indecision in adulthood:** The article opens by noting that many adults are "crippled with indecision" when facing difficult choices. This is framed as a preventable outcome if children get adequate practice making decisions early.

**Self-destructive patterns:** Some adults "make self-destructive choices and repeatedly demonstrate poor judgment." This is connected to not feeling good about themselves, which traces back to how they were treated as children.

**Lecturing after mistakes:** This triggers defensiveness and blocks learning. The child focuses on defending their choice rather than genuinely examining it.

**Saying "I told you so":** This specific phrase is called out as something to resist, especially with teens. It converts a learning moment into a shame moment.

**Over-controlling decisions:** While not stated explicitly, the entire framework implies that parents who make all decisions for children, or who prevent children from experiencing consequences, impede judgment development.

## The Connection Between Self-Worth and Decision Quality

This is presented as research-backed: children who have been treated "less than kindly" become accustomed to feeling bad. This habituation to negative feelings then influences their decision-making as teens and adults. They make choices that produce bad feelings because bad feelings are familiar and expected.

**The implication:** Helping children develop good judgment requires more than just the decision-practice framework. It also requires treating children kindly so they develop self-worth. Children who feel good about themselves take pleasure in making good decisions, creating a positive cycle. Children who feel bad about themselves may unconsciously sabotage through poor choices.

## Summary of the Complete Framework

1. **Start early** - Give decision-making practice before verbal ability develops
2. **Define boundaries** - Be explicit about what the child controls and what parents control
3. **Facilitate reflection** - Before, during, and after decisions through questions
4. **Model aloud** - Let children hear adult decision-making processes
5. **Expand gradually** - Increase latitude as developmentally appropriate
6. **Use mistakes** - Ask questions rather than lecture when bad decisions happen

All of this sits on a foundation of treating children kindly so they develop the self-worth that motivates good decision-making.
