# Toddlers: Your Game Plan for the Terrific Twos

Source: https://www.peacefulparenthappykids.com/read/toddlers-terrific-twos

## Core Framework: Why Toddlerhood Can Be Terrific or Terrible

The difficulty of the 15-36 month phase depends largely on the parent's attitude and approach. The central insight is that **your child's rebellion is inversely proportional to the freedom they are given to do their developmental work and how capable they feel** to get what they want in the world.

This means: the more you try to control everything, the more your toddler will push back. The more they feel competent and heard, the less they need to fight you.

### The Developmental Leap at 14 Months

Most children become harder to manage around fourteen months because they make a huge developmental leap:
- They are no longer easily distracted
- They realize they have some influence in the world but not a lot of power
- They start experimenting to see how they can get their needs met and desires fulfilled

This is not defiance for its own sake. It is the child learning how the world works and where they fit in it.

### Self-Assessment Questions for Parents

The more often you can answer "yes" to these questions, the easier your toddler will be to live with and the healthier their emotional development:

1. Can you appreciate your child's bids for independence without taking them as personal insults?
2. Can you give up some control so your child can develop some sense of mastery over their world?
3. Does your child know they can count on you to help them get their needs met, or do they feel they have to fight with you?
4. Can you set whatever limits are necessary for safety and your sanity, while empathizing with their disappointment when they don't get what they want?
5. Can you tolerate their anger at you with understanding, acknowledging the full range of emotions they express?
6. Can you see the situation from your child's point of view and empathize?

## Understanding Your Toddler's Developmental Tasks

It may seem like your toddler's main job is tearing your house apart. That is actually just part of a larger job they are trying to master: **learning the physical and social rules of the world**.

### What Toddlers Are Working On

- **Rapid physical and brain development** - their bodies and minds are growing at an extraordinary pace
- **Rapid acquisition of vocabulary and verbal rules** - learning language and how communication works
- **Learning how to stay connected to you while asserting their own needs and wants** - this is the core tension of toddlerhood
- **Development of Agency** - a sense of oneself as a powerful, competent person able to act successfully to get one's needs met
- **Learning that other children are people too** - and that they can relate to them safely, so they don't have to be aggressive
- **Learning the rules of the physical world** - like gravity
- **Learning the rules of the social world** - like how to ask for what you want

### Your Parenting Priorities

1. Keep your child safe as they explore
2. Give up some control so they can develop mastery over their world
3. Enjoy their emerging independence and curiosity
4. Stay connected even while redirecting or correcting
5. Stay positive

## The Four Core Needs of Toddlers

### 1. Validation of Their Sense of Agency

Your toddler already knows there are lots of limits and things they can't control. Now they need to learn that there are things they are in charge of, such as their own body (at least mostly). They need to experience themselves as competent and powerful, able to get their needs and desires met.

**Why this matters:** Without this sense of agency, children become either passive or oppositional. They need to feel they can make things happen in the world.

### 2. Structure, Limits, Routines and Security

Toddlers are beginning to grasp that it's a big world out there. Even their own feelings seem overwhelming to them at times. They need the reassurance that the parent is in charge and can keep them safe, from the world as well as from their own big feelings and lack of self control.

**The apparent paradox:** Toddlers need both freedom to develop agency AND structure to feel safe. These are not contradictory. Structure provides the safe container within which exploration can happen.

### 3. Help Understanding and Structuring Time

Toddlers need to know what to expect and do better with a definite routine. Example: "After lunch it's nap time, and then we'll drive to Grandma's."

**Why this works:** This helps them feel less out of control and pummeled by circumstance. Talking about the flow of time and the order of events also helps develop your child's prefrontal cortex, which handles the executive functions of the brain.

### 4. Responsiveness and Connection

Toddlers need to stay connected with their parents, especially at difficult moments when emotions run high.

**The logic from the child's perspective:** Even if they have to eventually learn more appropriate ways of expressing emotions, they need to know you love and accept them exactly as they are, even with all of those messy feelings. Even if you can't do what they want, it helps them cooperate if you understand and empathize with their unhappiness.

**The deeper lesson:** This is how your child learns that they can't always get what they want, but they get something better: a parent who loves them unconditionally, no matter what.

## Game Plan for a Fun Toddlerhood: 16 Strategies

### 1. Be the Person You Want Your Child to Be

Children learn to interact with others by experiencing relationships with their parents and siblings, and then they recreate what they've experienced.

**Critical insight:** Your toddler is learning both sides of any relationship they're in.

**Specific applications:**
- If you don't want them to tantrum, don't lose your temper at them (which models tantrumming)
- If you yell at them, you're teaching by example that tantrums are how humans appropriately express themselves and get what they want

### 2. Cultivate Empathy for Your Child

Your child's social skills start with empathy. Kids begin to develop empathy for others (and therefore, the ability to share, not hit, etc.) as they themselves feel understood.

**The causal chain:** Child feels understood -> Child develops empathy -> Child can share, not hit, navigate social situations

This is not optional. The child cannot develop empathy for others without first experiencing what it feels like to be empathized with.

### 3. Use Routines

Kids self-regulate more easily when they live in a safe, predictable, structured routine where they know what to expect.

**What happens when routines are disrupted:** Travel, Grandma's visit, or simply exceptions for your own convenience lead to tantrums, difficulty falling asleep, and other challenges.

**Practical wisdom:** Grandma is worth the disruption, but choosing disruptions wisely is part of protective parenting. Not every exception is worth the fallout.

### 4. Use Age-Appropriate Discipline

For toddlers, appropriate discipline means: empathic limits, information, redirection, and help with emotions.

**Research evidence:** Researchers compared two groups of toddlers who were rated as behaving about the same at the start of the study. During the study, some parents began spanking their kids at around age two, while others used positive discipline. The children who were spanked behaved worse a year later than the kids who weren't.

**Even yelling has negative effects:** Yelling at toddlers causes them to harden their hearts to you and become defiant.

**Larger pattern:** Toddlerhood is where violence starts. Ask yourself: Are you unwittingly teaching your kids that might makes right?

### 5. Sidestep Power Struggles

You don't have to prove you're right. Your child is trying to assert that they are a real person with some real power in the world. That's totally appropriate.

**Practical approach:** Let them say no whenever you can do so without compromise to safety, health, or other people's rights.

**Why this reduces tantrums:** Tantrums are an expression of powerlessness. Toddlers who feel some control over their lives have many fewer tantrums. If you remove all their power, they have no choice but to tantrum because they have no other way to assert themselves.

### 6. Pre-empt Tantrums

**First, normalize:** Tantrums are normal for kids this age.

**The three triggers:** Most tantrums happen when kids are hungry, tired, or feel disconnected.

**Preventive measures:**
- Preemptive feeding and napping
- Firm bedtimes
- Re-connection with you
- Cozy times
- Peaceful quiet time without media stimulation

**Understanding whining:** Whining is your child's signal that their internal resources are not up to the demands of that moment and they need your help. It's an early warning sign before a tantrum.

**Practical advice:** Learn to just say no to yourself! Don't squeeze in that last errand. Don't drag a hungry or tired kid to the store. Make do and do it tomorrow.

### 7. Use Play to "Manage" Your Toddler

Toddlers don't like to be ordered around any more than you do. What they do love is to play.

**Concrete examples for getting cooperation:**
- Fly your toddler up to their bath
- Get them to finish their milk by pretending to be a puppy who loves milk
- Get them into their carseat by pretending to be the flight attendant preparing for takeoff
- Race them to the car

**Why this works:** It gives them a way to cooperate that doesn't feel like submission. They're playing, not obeying.

### 8. Don't Take It Personally

Your toddler will at times reject you or be hurtful in some way. Don't take it personally.

**What's actually happening:** They're learning from you how to modulate their anger.

**Reframe the moment:** This is your opportunity to grow (choose love and understanding - this is a toddler!) and teach them at the same time.

### 9. Allow Time for Exploration

That's their job, after all: exploring, experimenting, learning. That's how their brain develops.

**Warning:** Rushing toddlers is one of the common triggers of avoidable tantrums. Build extra time into your schedule.

### 10. Don't Force Sharing (It Backfires)

Forcing sharing actually delays the development of sharing skills. Kids need to feel secure in their ownership before they can share.

**What to do instead:**
- Introduce the concept of taking turns: "It's Asia's turn to use the bucket. Then it will be your turn."
- Help them wait for their turn with empathy
- Help them put their favorite toys away before another child visits

**When they share voluntarily:** Empower them to make that choice again by observing, aloud, the effect of their choice: "Look how happy Kevin is that he gets a turn with your truck."

**Why verbal observation works:** It connects their action to its positive effect, reinforcing the internal reward of sharing rather than making it about obedience.

### 11. Let Your Child Be in Charge of Potty Training

This is a gradual learning process. They all get out of diapers sooner or later.

**The core principle:** Fights with your child about their body are fights you will never win.

**Reframe:** Toilet training can actually be empowering for your child, an important step in independence, but that depends on how you handle it.

**If they show zero interest:** Find opportunities for them to be around other kids who are using the toilet, and they'll quickly want to emulate them.

### 12. Eliminate Visual Electronic Media

**AAP recommendations:**
- Children under two should not watch TV or videos at all because they have other important developmental work to do and because it impacts brain development
- Older children should watch AT MOST an hour or two per day of nonviolent, educational TV

**The author's recommendation:** TV and movies only for special occasions.

**Research on Sesame Street:** Even though we're told it's good for children, research shows it influences brain development and shortens the attention span.

**The addiction pathway:**
1. It starts an addiction in kids who are prone to it
2. When they're a little older, they'll want to watch other TV
3. Before they're much older, you'll wonder why they flip on the TV instead of reading a book
4. You will have stopped being able to monitor what they watch by the time they're eight

### 13. Feeding Is the Toddler's Job

Never fight over food. You provide the healthy food. They feed it to themselves.

**Starting early:** Yes, even when they're tiny. Just put a mat under the high chair.

**Don't obsess about quantities:** Kids don't starve themselves.

**The bedtime food request pattern:** Many toddlers are too busy during the day to eat enough and therefore ask for food at bedtime. This can drive a parent around the bend, unless you build a bedtime snack into the schedule.

**Why a scheduled bedtime snack works:**
- It often helps kids settle down and sleep better
- If you make sure the snack is healthy, you take the pressure off dinner so you can enjoy your child more at dinner without prodding them to eat
- You can combine it with the bedtime story if you're short on time

### 14. Forget About Teaching the Alphabet or Using Screens

**What the intellectual work of toddlers actually is:**
- Exploring
- Observing the world
- Talking and being listened to
- Being accepted, validated and acknowledged

**Foundation first:** Emotional self-management lays the foundation for intellectual development.

**On reading:** It's never too early to develop a love of books, but that doesn't happen by learning the alphabet. If you want your child to love reading, then read to them and tell them stories.

**On screens:** Screens actually have a net negative effect on intellectual development.

### 15. Pre-empt Whining

Whining is an expression of the child's feeling of powerlessness.

**Two-part approach:**
1. Meet needs as soon as your child expresses them
2. Help your child with those helpless feelings

If you wait until they're whining, you've waited too long.

### 16. Give Her the Opportunity to Experience Competence

**The core finding:** Toddlers tantrum less and cooperate more when they feel more powerful.

**Three key ways to help your toddler feel more powerful:**
1. Listen to them
2. Let them make decisions whenever possible
3. Give them the opportunity to experience competence

## Deep Dive: Building Competence Through Work

Toddlers need daily experience with work to gain confidence in their own capabilities and begin to think of themselves as competent people.

**Reframe your assumptions:** As adults, we tend to think of work as burdensome. But toddlers LOVE to:
- Understand how the household functions
- Participate
- Feel valuable by contributing to the household
- Learn by doing

This was one of **Maria Montessori's most important insights**.

**The trade-off:** The help will make your job harder in the short term, but:
- They're learning and gaining skills for the future
- You're bonding
- In a few years when you want them to do chores, you'll wish you had been patient and gotten them started working with you

### Specific Household Tasks Toddlers Can Do

They can stand on a stool or bench in the kitchen to help with:
- Making themselves a snack (peeling fruit or an egg, slicing soft cheese, making sandwiches with crackers)
- Helping wash pots and pans or other unbreakable dishes
- Washing vegetables in the sink
- Wiping the counter off
- Helping clean the refrigerator
- Helping set the table
- Helping clear the table
- Turning lights on and off
- Dusting
- Scrubbing the tub (from inside, barefoot!)
- Pairing socks as you fold clothes
- Sorting clothes (which clean clothes belong to which family member?)
- Helping transfer clothes from washer to dryer, pulling clothes out of dryer, or hanging them on a line
- Picking out fruit at the grocery store
- Washing the table or floor

**Why this matters more than screens:** These activities are ultimately much more educational and satisfying than any screen, and most young children love them.

**The internal experience:** After completing such a task, the toddler says "I did it!" and feels like a more capable, powerful person. Compare that to how they feel after watching a screen for an hour.

**Cognitive benefits:** The cognitive development is huge.

**The multi-layered payoff:**
- You're helping your toddler feel competent and powerful, so they don't need to assert their power by being contrary
- They're more confident
- They're better at problem-solving
- They develop more executive function, earlier
- They're more helpful, now and in the future

## Key Warnings and Anti-Patterns

### Don't Model Tantrums
If you lose your temper, yell, or tantrum at your child, you are teaching them that this is how humans appropriately express themselves and get what they want.

### Don't Force Sharing
This actually delays the development of sharing skills because children need to feel secure in their ownership before they can voluntarily share.

### Don't Fight About Food or Potty Training
These are fights about your child's body, and they are fights you will never win. They also damage the relationship and your child's sense of autonomy.

### Don't Rush
Rushing toddlers is a common trigger of avoidable tantrums. Build extra time into your schedule for exploration.

### Don't Take Rejection Personally
When your toddler rejects you or is hurtful, they are learning to modulate their anger. This is developmental, not personal.

### Don't Squeeze In That Last Errand
When your child is hungry, tired, or disconnected, every additional demand increases the likelihood of a tantrum. Make do and do it tomorrow.

### Don't Use Screens as Development Tools
Despite marketing claims, screens have a net negative effect on intellectual development and can start addictive patterns.

## Foundational Quote

"The first three years of life establishes the blueprints for all of our future relationships." - John Bowlby

This underscores why the approach you take during toddlerhood matters so much: you are not just managing behavior, you are establishing patterns that will shape how your child relates to others for the rest of their life.
