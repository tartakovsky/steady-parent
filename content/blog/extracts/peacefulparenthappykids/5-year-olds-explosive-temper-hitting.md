# Managing Explosive Temper and Hitting in a 5-Year-Old

## The Core Problem: Why Children Lash Out

**Under anger is always a more threatening emotion**: fear, hurt, disappointment, or sadness. When a child has an explosive outburst, they are actually experiencing one of these deeper, more vulnerable feelings and responding by attacking. This attack response is normal five-year-old behavior, though by age five many children have developed the ability to not act on those "attack" feelings.

The parent's job is to help children learn to manage and tolerate these uncomfortable feelings so they don't continue lashing out at others into adulthood.

## The Underlying Issue: Fragile Self-Esteem and Perfectionism

When a child's sense that **"All of me is good, even my yucky feelings"** is fragile, unhappiness or imperfection threatens their self-esteem so severely that they must defend against those feelings by lashing out. The child in this case gets extremely angry when she can't do something as well as her peers (retrieving objects underwater, for example) and attacks the friend who outperformed her.

This pattern reveals that the child equates her worth with her performance. When she fails or struggles, it feels like an attack on her entire self, triggering a defensive aggressive response.

## Why Punishment Makes It Worse

**Punishing a child for lashing out will only make the behavior worse.** The reasoning: punishment adds more negative feelings (shame, hurt, fear) to a child who is already overwhelmed by difficult emotions. Since the root problem is an inability to tolerate threatening feelings, adding more threatening feelings through punishment intensifies the underlying issue rather than addressing it.

## Two-Part Approach to Change

### Part 1: Help the Child Tolerate Threatening Feelings

**Establish that "Nobody's perfect"** as an explicit, repeated message. Anytime you observe the child demanding perfection of herself, remind her that no one is perfect, and that's okay.

When talking with the child after an incident, always go to the **feelings under the anger**. Acknowledge and empathize with those deeper feelings. Help her develop awareness of them and become accepting of them as just part of being human.

The mechanism of change: If the child learns that her parent loves her just the way she is, including her difficult feelings and imperfections, she will begin to accept these aspects in herself. Self-acceptance reduces the need for defensive aggression.

### Part 2: Develop Anger Management Skills

Help the child understand **why** she is getting angry. Use explicit, specific language that connects her behavior to the underlying feeling:

**Example script**: "You were mad at your friend because she could dive under the water. You can be angry, we all get angry. But we never hit. What can you do when you feel angry, instead? Can you come tell me? Can you go get a drink of water and breathe deep ten times? Can you squeeze a squeezey ball?"

This script demonstrates several key elements:
- Name the specific trigger (friend's superior ability)
- Validate the emotion (anger is acceptable)
- Set a clear boundary (hitting is never allowed)
- Offer concrete alternative actions
- Let the child participate in choosing her strategy

## What Doesn't Work and Why

**Time-outs**: Not effective for this pattern because they don't address the underlying fragile self-esteem or teach emotional regulation

**Demanding apologies in the moment**: Doesn't work because the child is still emotionally dysregulated and can't access genuine remorse

**Telling her the behavior is unacceptable**: While boundary-setting is necessary, this alone doesn't teach what to do instead or address the root cause

The parent in this scenario noted that her daughter can express her feelings well during calm conversations and seems to understand what she's done, yet the same explosive behavior recurs hours later. This indicates that intellectual understanding is not the missing piece. The child needs help at the emotional level, building tolerance for difficult feelings and developing automatic alternative responses to replace the attack impulse.

## Resource Recommendation

**"Smartlove" by Martha Heineman Pieper** is specifically recommended for helping children with this pattern of fragile self-esteem leading to explosive behavior.
