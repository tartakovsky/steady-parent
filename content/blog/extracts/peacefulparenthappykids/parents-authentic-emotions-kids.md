## The Core Principle: Authenticity Is Valuable But Complex

Showing children authentic emotions is generally beneficial, but this principle is frequently misinterpreted. The common misinterpretation is that screaming at children is acceptable because it shows "authentic anger." This interpretation is wrong and actually damaging to children.

**Anger is not authentic by itself** because it is not the whole truth. Anger is the body's defensive reaction to deeper emotions: fear, powerlessness, grief, or other upsetting feelings. If a parent wanted to be truly authentic when their child resists homework, they would express the underlying truth: fear that the child might have a learning disability, powerlessness to motivate the child, terror that the child will fail at school and damage their future. But expressing these raw fears directly to a child would be harmful, which demonstrates that pure unfiltered authenticity is not the goal.

## The Problem with Stoicism

**Stoicism** is defined as enduring pain or hardship without displaying feelings and without complaint. The core issue with parental stoicism is when parents stuff their feelings and communicate to children that emotions are not acceptable.

Why this damages children:
- Children need to see that it is safe to experience emotions
- When children receive the message that emotions are not okay, they learn to suppress their own feelings
- Children who try to push their feelings away must rigidly fend off emotions, which causes them to lose emotional flexibility
- Suppressed emotions end up outside conscious control and tend to emerge when the child is tired or frustrated, making them more likely to lash out

## Healthy Emotional Modeling: What It Looks Like

### Showing Sadness and Tears

It is good for children to see parents cry sometimes. When this happens:
- Sit down and cry if needed
- Explain simply: "I'm sad, so I'm crying, but things will be okay"
- Shortly afterward, smile at the child and talk about what happened
- This sequence is a valuable learning experience for children

### When Strong Emotions Like Grief Arise

When swept by very strong emotions:
- Cry openly
- If the child becomes upset, hold them and reassure them
- Explain specifically what you are sad about: "I am feeling sad about xyz, and so I'm crying"
- Tell them you will stop crying soon
- If there is any possibility the child might think your tears are their fault, explicitly reassure them it is not their fault
- Remind them that everyone needs to cry sometimes

This kind of modeling makes it safe for children to feel their full range of emotions.

### The Critical Limit

If you find yourself weeping on a daily basis, this signals it is time to get support to heal emotionally without involving your children in your deep emotional work. Children should not be participants in ongoing parental emotional processing.

## The Most Important Message to Model About Scary Emotions

**Core message to convey: We can handle difficult emotions, and they are not an emergency.**

Why this matters:
- This message helps children feel safe enough to allow themselves to feel their own emotions
- Once a child feels an emotion (rather than suppressing it), the emotion begins to dissipate
- After feeling the emotion, the child moves back into a state of equilibrium

This is a self-regulating cycle: safety -> feeling the emotion -> emotion dissipates -> return to equilibrium.

## What Not to Do: Getting Overwhelmed by Children's Emotions

A problematic pattern is when parents get overwhelmed by their child's emotions and become anxious or afraid in response. Parents have a responsibility to work on their own emotional regulation to minimize responding to their child from their own anxiety.

**The parent's role is described through metaphors:**
- The grown-up
- The sherpa (guide through difficult terrain)
- The one holding the flashlight

When a child slides into dark emotional waters, the parent's job is to hold the light and help them out, not to jump in with them. **Drama does not serve children.**

This does not mean being stoic in the sense of dulling your response. The distinction is:
- Not okay: Falling apart when kids are upset
- Not okay: Being emotionally dull/unresponsive
- Okay: Staying regulated while remaining emotionally present

## Managing Your Own Emotions Throughout the Day

Staying calm when children are upset is challenging because parents have feelings too. The ideal approach is to feel comfortable enough with your own feelings to honor them as they arise.

What this looks like in practice:
- Shifting through different emotions throughout the day: happiness, sadness, disappointment, frustration, delight
- Emotions are always arising and passing away
- Tears come to the eyes and smiles come to the lips naturally
- Accept all emotions and let them move through you
- When you accept emotions and let them flow, they dissipate rather than triggering you

**Teaching opportunity:** If you talk with your kids as you feel those emotions, you teach them about emotional wholeness at the same time.

## Handling Anger: A Special Case

**Anger is the body's fight response** - a message that there is a threat. The danger is that when we are in the grip of anger, our child often looks like the enemy.

### Why Acting from Anger Is Problematic

- Any decision made while angry derives from fear, not love
- Part of the anger comes from the current interaction, but part of it comes from your own past and how you are seeing the situation
- Your child's offense will not seem nearly as terrible once you calm down, regardless of what it is

### The Rule for Anger

Resist acting while angry, except to address an immediate safety issue. Specifically:
- Resist interacting until you calm down
- Once calm, ask for what you need in a way that is not an attack

### Debunking the "They Should See My Anger" Belief

If you think your child deserves to see how angry they have made you, remember:
- Those are your feelings
- Only part of the emotion comes from the current interaction
- Part comes from your own past and your interpretation of the situation
- You will be much more effective in guiding your child once you calm down

## The Principle of Not Dumping Emotions

**Being authentic about your experience never requires dumping unfiltered emotions on someone else.**

Quote from the Dalai Lama: "Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible."

Dr. Laura's version: "Less drama and more love."

## Summary Framework

| Approach | Effect on Children |
|----------|-------------------|
| Stoicism (suppressing emotions, communicating they're not okay) | Damaging - children learn to suppress, lose flexibility, emotions pop out uncontrolled |
| Overwhelming/anxious response to children's emotions | Not ideal - parent fails to be the regulated guide |
| Unfiltered anger expression | Damaging - decisions made from fear not love |
| Modeling regulated emotional experience with explanation | Beneficial - children learn emotions are safe to feel and will pass |
| Daily weeping/ongoing emotional crisis | Need support - too much for children to witness regularly |

The goal is to be the regulated, emotionally present guide who shows children that emotions can be experienced safely and will naturally dissipate when allowed to flow.
