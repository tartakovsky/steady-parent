# Does Breastfeeding Have an Effect on IQ?

## Core Finding: Breastfeeding Raises IQ by 3-5 Points

The latest scientific research conclusively shows that breastfeeding raises IQ by **three to five points**. This finding comes from a **comprehensive review of 11 different studies involving over 7,000 children**, published in the **October 2007 edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition**. The review concluded that breastfed infants tested **5.2 IQ points higher on average** than formula-fed infants.

## Addressing Confounding Variables: Is It Really the Breastmilk?

### The Skeptical Questions

Researchers have long questioned whether the IQ boost is genuinely caused by breastmilk itself or by correlated factors:

1. **Maternal education**: Are mothers who choose to breastfeed simply more educated, and does that education drive higher child IQ?
2. **Income levels**: Breastfeeding is associated with higher incomes, which are independently associated with higher IQs. Is wealth the real driver?
3. **Maternal bonding**: Breastfeeding is associated with better maternal bonding, and we know bonding raises kids' IQs. Is bonding the mechanism rather than nutrition?

The association between breastfeeding and IQ was well established, but many researchers assumed it was because well-educated, wealthier women are more likely to breastfeed. Their children score better on mental tests, but this might be due to class and educational advantages rather than breastfeeding itself.

### The Study That Controlled for Everything

This study, led by **nutritionist James Anderson**, is described as the **first large study that controlled for**:
- Maternal bonding
- The decision to breastfeed
- Education
- Income
- Birth weight
- Maternal smoking
- Birth order

**Result**: Even after controlling for all these factors, breastfed babies still tested **over three points higher in IQ** than formula-fed babies.

### The 60/40 Split: Nutrition vs. Other Factors

James Anderson's team was able to separate the purely nutritional benefits from other factors. According to Anderson:

- **40% of the IQ increase** is attributable to maternal bonding and the decision to breastfeed
- **60% of the IQ increase (3.2 points)** is related to the actual nutritional value of breastmilk

This is a critical distinction: while bonding, education, and income all do raise IQ, breastmilk by itself has a significant, independent effect.

## Why Breastmilk Matters for Brain Development

### The Critical Window

Babies' brains develop rapidly in the first year after birth. This period lays the **neural groundwork for later intelligence, mood, and emotional self-control**. This brain development depends entirely on the food babies receive, which is their only source of nutrients during this time.

### Evolutionary Adaptation

Human ancestors survived on breastmilk for the first couple years of life. As a result, human brain development is **adapted to and depends on the nutrients in breastmilk**. The human brain evolved expecting breastmilk as its fuel during critical developmental periods.

## Concerns About Formula: The "Wholesale Experiment"

### What We Don't Know

Many experts now view feeding babies formula as a **"wholesale experiment"** that may have unforeseen consequences. The concern stems from the fact that our science is just beginning to figure out what's actually in breastmilk.

### Known Gaps in Formula

Even some breastmilk components that have long been known to be important in brain development have still not been incorporated into infant formulas. Specific examples mentioned:
- **DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)** - a fatty acid important for brain development
- **AA (arachidonic acid)** - a fatty acid important for brain development

### Unknown Unknowns

Beyond the known components not yet included in formula, there are likely many components of breastmilk that haven't yet been identified at all. The argument is that **science still has a long way to go to catch up to Mother Nature** - we cannot replicate what we haven't yet discovered.
