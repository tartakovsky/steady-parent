## Key Concepts

### Preteen Brain Development and Relationships
- 12-year-olds' brains are rewiring, making them volatile
- Peers become increasingly important while parents become less influential
- Maintaining a strong parent-child relationship before and during preteen/teen years is crucial
- A child repeatedly breaking rules often signals a relationship issue rather than just a discipline problem

### Video Game Addiction Recognition
- Video games (especially games like Fortnite) are purposely designed to be addictive
- Signs of addiction: when a child repeatedly overrides what they value (their word, integrity, relationships) for momentary good feelings
- A child's pulse can race just thinking about the game
- Expecting a child to resist their "drug" when near it without strong relationship support is unrealistic
- CommonSense Media recommends age 13+ for games like Fortnite due to the self-discipline required

### The "Too Sick for School, Too Sick for Screens" Rule
- This is a valid and recommended rule to prevent faking illness
- When home sick, children can: sleep, read, hang out and talk with parents, or do quiet activities like drawing
- No screen time during illness helps maintain the integrity of sick days

## Practical Strategies

### Setting Up for Success
- Don't leave a child alone near their temptation (keep them away from screens/gaming areas when rules are in effect)
- Acknowledge that resisting addiction is genuinely hard
- Provide physical support by keeping the child near you rather than trusting willpower alone

### Addressing Rule-Breaking Without Punishment
- Focus on the broken trust, not the specific rule violation
- Frame consequences as natural outcomes (broken trust needs repair) rather than punishment
- Removing the game console is not punishment when framed as support for overcoming addiction
- Create agreements about future use before reinstating privileges

### Sample Language for Addressing the Situation
When talking to your child after they break a video game rule:
1. Acknowledge their struggle: "It was really hard for you to resist, and I did not realize that and did not help"
2. State their responsibility: "It was your responsibility to tell me you were tempted and needed help keeping your promise"
3. Offer support: "I will always help you"
4. Name what needs repair: "Since you broke your promise, our relationship needs work to rebuild trust"
5. Be clear about your role: "I will forgive you and support you, but you have to do the work to rebuild trust"
6. Address the addiction directly: "I learned how addicted you are - that you would even betray our relationship for it"

### Rebuilding After Trust Is Broken
- Ask the child what they will do to repair the trust
- Remove the temptation entirely until the relationship is repaired
- Create a signed agreement about usage before allowing any screen time again
- Start with very small doses when reintroducing and monitor closely
- Continue discussing the addiction openly as they begin playing again

### Parent Self-Reflection
- When you don't believe your child, examine why - it may signal previous lying which itself signals relationship issues
- Acknowledge your own contributions to relationship deterioration
- Apologize for lack of empathy or anything that created distance
- Commit to doing your part in relationship repair while making clear the child must also do their part

## Key Principles

### On Consequences vs. Support
- Consequences often become punishment, which erodes relationships
- Children should clean up their own messes, including repairing relationships
- Parents should give kids support to be their best selves
- Removing a source of addiction is support, not punishment, when framed correctly

### On Trust and Lying
- All children experiment with lying to parents - it's developmentally normal
- Lying still requires relationship repair
- The natural consequence of lying is reduced trust, which must be earned back
- The parent not believing the child in the future is not an appropriate consequence

### Promise to Your Child
Even when you can't give your child what they want, you can offer: "A parent who understands and believes in you, no matter what"
