# Teaching Children Optimism

## Why Optimism Matters

Optimism serves as a cornerstone of resilience, enabling people to persevere when times are hard. The conviction that things will work out and that one's actions can have a positive impact is essential for providing a calm, loving home environment, especially during frightening or overwhelming times.

Research demonstrates that optimists achieve measurably better life outcomes:
- They are more likely to achieve success because they believe they can
- They experience lower rates of depression
- They get fewer illnesses
- They maintain longer relationships
- They live longer

The practical importance becomes clear in difficult moments: when life deals one blow after another, a child needs to believe things can get better. Without this belief, there is no motivation to pull themselves together and keep going.

## Nature vs. Nurture in Optimism

There is evidence that optimism has an inherited component, and there is certainly a biological basis to both depression and a tendency toward being upbeat.

However, evidence also shows that we learn how to view the world and its potential from those around us at an early age. Parents can unthinkingly influence children to interpret events in negative ways.

**The critical finding**: Research demonstrates that we can change the way we talk to ourselves about events and how we interpret them. This directly impacts our emotional reactions to experiences.

**The bottom line**: Even if a child is born with a tendency toward pessimism, they can greatly increase their optimism quotient through learned skills.

## How to Help Your Child Become More Optimistic

### Step 1: Notice How Your Child Thinks About Things

The first step is observation. When something bad happens, pay attention to whether your child sees it as exemplary of their entire life. Watch for patterns where they interpret misfortune as:
- Pervasive (affecting everything)
- Permanent (will always be this way)
- Personally directed at them

A key indicator phrase to listen for: "Why does this always happen to me?"

If you observe pessimistic thinking patterns, you can actively help them learn optimism.

### Step 2: Challenge Pessimism

**Pessimistic thinking defined**: Expecting bad things to happen and thinking catastrophically.

Example of catastrophic thinking: "I won't make any friends at this new school. No one is going to like me."

**The Four Thought Patterns That Lead to Pessimistic Thinking** (these are the targets to challenge):

1. **Permanence**: "This always happens and always will."
   - The belief that negative situations are fixed and unchanging

2. **Pervasive**: "Nothing ever goes right."
   - The belief that problems in one area indicate problems everywhere

3. **Personal**: "This always happens to me."
   - The belief that negative events are specifically targeting the individual

4. **Powerlessness**: "There is no real relationship between cause and effect; things just happened; I am the victim of what has occurred."
   - The belief that one has no agency in outcomes

To deflate pessimism, actively identify and challenge each of these four patterns when they appear in your child's thinking.

### Step 3: Teach the Principles of Optimism

**The essential trick**: Remember that you perceive a setback any way you choose.

**Core principle** (so important it bears repeating): What happens to us is much less important than the story we tell ourselves about what happens to us.

Help your child choose to perceive setbacks as:

1. **Temporary**: This will pass; it won't last forever

2. **Isolated rather than pervasive**: The setback doesn't indicate anything about any other part of their life

3. **Impersonal**: This is not a referendum on their value as a person

4. **Within their power to fix**: They have agency to change the situation

**How can a setback be impersonal?**
- Some bad things are simply bad luck that could have happened to anyone
- Even when a child clearly brought a setback on themselves, it still doesn't indicate anything about who they are as a person - only how they chose to act in that one instance
- Example: Failing a test because they didn't study says something about that specific choice, not that they "always fail tests and always will"

**Martin Seligman's most important question** (from the trail-blazing researcher on optimism): When confronted with misfortune, ask: "Is it possible that there are some ways that you could change the outcome with some personal effort on your part?"

This question redirects attention from victimhood to agency.

### Step 4: Help Your Child Cultivate Optimistic Thinking

Three specific ideas to internalize:

1. **"There are actions I could or can take to change the situation."**
   - Contrasts with: "I am a victim here"
   - Emphasizes agency and possibility

2. **"There are specific reasons something happened."**
   - Contrasts with: "Everything always goes wrong" (global thinking)
   - Emphasizes that causes are specific and identifiable, not cosmic

3. **"The cause is clearly leading to the effect, and that is true over time."**
   - Sometimes I can affect those factors, which means I can make the outcome better
   - Sometimes I can't affect those reasons, but that means they are not my fault
   - Contrasts with: "Bad things just happen to me" or "Life is just out to get me"
   - Emphasizes logical cause-and-effect relationships and distinguishing between controllable and uncontrollable factors

### Step 5: Confront Negative Self-Talk

**The problem with self-talk**: When you hear it, you believe it. Then you act as if it were true.

**Critical insight**: Just because you are telling yourself something does not mean it's true. It's a belief that could be wrong. There are many ways to interpret events, and some interpretations are much healthier than others.

**The NED Process** (from cognitive therapy for confronting pessimistic thinking):

**N - Notice negative self-talk**
- Build awareness of when pessimistic internal dialogue is occurring

**E - Externalize it**
- Treat the negative self-talk as if it were said by an external person whose mission in life is to make you miserable
- Some kids personify this voice and call him "NED"
- This creates psychological distance from the thoughts

**D - Dispute it**
- Argue against the negative voice the same way you would dispute an external person making false accusations
- We generally have the skill of disputing other people when they make false accusations
- We can learn to apply this same skill to our own negative thoughts

### Step 6: Model Optimism

Your view of the world and your prospects within it communicates itself to your child daily through your words and reactions.

**Contrast example**:
- Optimistic: "I know we'll find a parking space soon!"
- Pessimistic: "We'll NEVER find a parking space! I KNEW this would happen!"

**Key insight**: If you want to help your child become more optimistic, experiment with learning to be more optimistic yourself.

All the techniques in this framework work for adults too. They can become opportunities for family dinner table conversations. Consider starting an "Optimism challenge" as a family activity.

## The Broader Context

Optimism is not naive denial but a practical orientation toward possibility and agency. As historian Howard Zinn observed: "Small acts, when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world... To be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness."

The warning about seeing only the worst: "If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something."

The power of remembering positive examples: "If we remember those times and places - and there are so many - where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction."
