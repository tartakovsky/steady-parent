# Enforcing Limits Without Punishment: When an Older Child Hits the Baby

## The Core Question

How do parents enforce limits without crossing the line into punishment? This is especially challenging in scenarios like when a 3-year-old hits a parent or baby sibling during nursing, and ignores verbal limits.

## Understanding Why Children Ignore Limits

When a child does not accept a limit you have set, there is always a reason. **The child is showing you that something is so wrong inside them that they cannot cooperate, even though they love you and want to please you.** Children who have good relationships with their parents genuinely want to please them - when they cannot, they are sending an SOS.

**The child ignoring your limit needs help with the big feelings or unmet needs driving their behavior.** They are trying to communicate that they need help but do not have the words to express it.

## Why Punishment Does Not Work

If you ignore the message the child is sending through their misbehavior, they will escalate the misbehavior until you respond to their underlying message. This is why permissive parenting fails.

However, insisting on limits never means punishing. **Punishment does not address the cause of the misbehavior, so it does not prevent future episodes.** Responding with punishment communicates to the child that they are a naughty person who cannot control themselves and needs to be punished. Children believe everything we tell them about themselves, making this a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**Critical insight:** The only reason children choose to do what parents want (instead of what they want) is because they hope to please their parents. Punishment destroys this fundamental motivation for good behavior.

## The Three-Step Formula for Holding Limits Without Punishment

**Step 1: Move in to uphold the limit physically**

Stay calm and kind, but firm. Physically intervene - catch the child's arm as they go to hit. State the limit clearly and simply.

**Step 2: Connect - Acknowledge the feelings or desires under the child's behavior**

This is how you help the child move past those feelings so they can cooperate. Let them know you hear what they are communicating and that you want to help with what is upsetting them. Use phrases like "It looks like you want..."

**Step 3: Redirect**

Tell the child what they CAN do instead. Offer an alternative way to get their needs met.

## Applied Example: Toddler Hits Baby During Nursing

**Scenario:** A three-year-old hits the baby sister while mom is nursing.

**The mindset shift:** Remember that a kid who is aggressive is a kid who is frightened. The child is scared the parent does not love them anymore, and as a result, they are furious at the baby. These are just feelings, and feelings pass.

**Initial response combining all three steps:**

1. Set the limit: "Hitting hurts. I won't let you hit Maya."
2. Connect and empathize: "It looks like you want me to hold you right now. I see how upset you are."
3. Redirect: "You can tell me, 'Hold me, Mama!' Would you like to snuggle up and read a book with me while I finish feeding Maya? Then I can play your game with you."

## When the Initial Response Does Not Work

Sometimes empathy and redirection work immediately. Other times, the feelings are too overwhelming and the child tries to hit again.

**How to enforce the limit physically:** Put your whole body into intervening to stop the behavior. You might hold the child's hand, get between the children, or pick up either the baby or the toddler. If nursing, stand up so the child cannot reach the baby. This is "enforcing" the limit - not with punishment, but by physically preventing the unwanted action.

**Important distinction:** You are not using force as punishment. You are using your body to physically prevent harm while staying calm and connected.

## Giving the Child a Tool to Express Big Feelings

After physically preventing the hit, acknowledge their SOS and give them a safe way to show the depth of their feelings.

Example script: "You're feeling so bad and you want me to know, so you're hitting. It's so hard when you want my help and my hands are full. It's ok to be mad, AND I won't let you hurt your sister. But you can show me how mad you are by stomping your feet very hard. I will watch how hard you stomp."

**Critical principle:** Do NOT send the child away to "get their anger out." That does not help. **The child needs to show YOU how upset they are so they feel understood.** The feeling must be witnessed and validated by the parent.

**Encourage expression:** When the child stomps, reflect what you see and fully accept their feelings: "I see you stomping so hard! Wow! You are mad!"

## Reconnecting After the Feelings Are Expressed

Once the child has had a chance to express their feelings, reconnect directly.

Invite connection: "Will you come look in my eyes? I have something to tell you."

Then reassure them: "Thank you for showing me how you feel. I see how upset you are right now that I am feeding the baby when you want me to be with you. Sweetheart, I could never love anyone more than I love you. There is always enough love for you, no matter how much your sister gets. I want to snuggle with you right now, and I want to play your game with you as soon as my hands are free."

Offer an immediate way forward: "Will you come snuggle with me and we will read your book while I finish feeding the baby? Then we can play your game."

## The Ongoing Prevention Work

Enforcing the limit and listening to what the child is communicating addresses the immediate situation. But the real work is helping the child resolve the tangled-up fears triggering their aggression. This requires ongoing prevention strategies:

**Strategy 1: Create opportunities for emotional expression**

Give the child chances to "show" you those upset feelings that are pulling them off-track. Schedule time for them to release these emotions in your presence.

**Strategy 2: Strengthen connection**

Even if you feel connected to your child, big emotions can make children feel disconnected. Work on both the emotions AND the connection simultaneously.

**Strategy 3: Intervene before hitting occurs**

Notice when your child starts acting unhappy and intervene BEFORE they resort to hitting. Early intervention is always more effective than response after the fact.

## Key Principles Summary

1. Limits are essential and must be maintained - but never through punishment
2. Misbehavior is always communication about unmet needs or overwhelming feelings
3. Physical intervention to prevent harm is different from physical punishment
4. Children need to express their feelings TO the parent, not away from the parent
5. The goal is addressing underlying fears and strengthening connection, not just stopping the immediate behavior
6. Prevention through early intervention and emotional attunement is the long-term solution
