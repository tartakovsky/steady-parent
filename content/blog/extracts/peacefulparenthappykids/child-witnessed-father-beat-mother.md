# Helping a Child Who Witnessed Domestic Violence

## The Urgency of Professional Help and Safety

**Professional counseling is essential and urgent** for both the mother and child in this situation. The mother needs counseling immediately, in part to ensure she does not return to the abusive partner. Abuse of this nature only escalates over time - it gets worse, not better.

The child has been traumatized by witnessing violence. **If he receives help to process his trauma, he will be fine.** However, if he does not get that help, he is at risk of re-enacting the trauma later in life - potentially by becoming an abuser himself who beats his own partner. This makes intervention critical not just for immediate wellbeing but for long-term development and breaking cycles of violence.

**Critical safety warning**: Returning to an abusive relationship is dangerous. It is entirely possible that such a man could eventually kill his partner if she returns. Even if the mother struggles to prioritize herself, she owes it to her son not to go back to that marriage - both for his immediate safety and to prevent him from witnessing more incidents that increase his risk of becoming an abuser.

## What the Mother Can Do at Home Before Counseling

While professional help should happen as soon as possible, the mother can begin helping her child immediately. The core approach involves **explaining what happened and making it safe for the child to express his feelings**.

### Providing an Explanation

The child is asking questions like "Why did daddy beat mommy?" and "What did she do wrong?" He needs clear answers that accomplish several things:

1. **Establish that the mother did nothing wrong** - The child needs to understand that violence was not caused by anything the mother did.

2. **Explain the father's behavior without excusing it** - The explanation should acknowledge that the father was drinking, that his mind was not working right, and that he is hurting inside so much that he cannot find his own love and lashes out in anger instead.

3. **Acknowledge the fear and provide reassurance of safety** - The child needs to hear that it was scary, that both he and his mother were frightened, and that they are now safe.

**Example narrative the mother can use:**

"On that terrible day, Daddy got very angry. He was hurting in his heart and could not find his love. He had been drinking and his mind was not working right. He forgot how much he loves his wife and child. He forgot to control his own anger. He got so very angry that he shouted and hit. It was so scary. You were very frightened. Mommy was very frightened. It hurt Mommy. But Mommy protected us both. Mommy got us away. We are not going back to see Daddy unless he can stop drinking and find his love again. Now we will have a new life where we are both safe. I will always keep you safe."

This narrative serves multiple purposes: it provides honest information at a child's level, names the emotions involved, acknowledges the trauma, and ends with reassurance about the future and safety.

### Helping the Child Express and Process Emotions

Beyond explanation, the mother must **help her son cry and express his feelings**. This means creating space for emotional release and actively drawing out his experience.

When telling the story and reaching emotional moments like "It was scary," she can pause and engage:
- "You were so scared, right? Tell me what you saw..."
- "Yes, you're right, Daddy was shouting so loud..."
- "I am so sorry I could not protect you..."
- "Where did you hide? What did you do?"

The goal is to **make it safe for the child to tell his mother what he saw and express his feelings about it**. He needs to be able to share his experience and have his emotions witnessed and validated.

## Common Feelings Children Experience After Witnessing Violence

### Guilt for Not Protecting the Parent

The child probably feels guilty for not protecting his mother. This is a common response. The mother should directly address this by telling him that **it is the grownups' job to keep the kids safe** - not the other way around. His job is always to keep himself safe, not to intervene or protect adults.

### Self-Blame and Believing They Caused It

Children often believe the violence was their fault - that if they had been better kids, the abuser would have stayed calm. This is a fundamental misunderstanding that must be corrected. **The child needs to be reassured that this problem is inside his father and has nothing to do with him.** The violence was not caused by anything the child did or failed to do.

### Fear of Becoming Like the Abuser

Children who witness abuse often fear they will grow up to be like the abuser. This fear should be addressed directly. The mother should tell him that:

1. **Everyone gets angry** - Anger itself is normal and universal
2. **We always have a choice about whether to lash out** - Anger does not force anyone to become violent
3. **It is never okay to do what his father did and hit another person in anger** - This establishes a clear moral boundary

This teaching helps the child understand that he is not destined to repeat the pattern - he will have choices and agency.

## Current Symptoms and Their Meaning

The child is displaying trauma symptoms:
- Waking up in the middle of the night
- Hearing his father shouting (when the father is not present)
- Being afraid of his father

These symptoms indicate active trauma that needs processing. They support the urgency of both professional help and the mother's active engagement in helping him work through what happened.

## Key Principles

- **Abuse escalates** - It only gets worse over time, making leaving essential
- **Witnessing trauma puts children at risk** - Both for immediate psychological harm and long-term patterns
- **Processing trauma prevents re-enactment** - Children who get help will be fine; those who do not may repeat the cycle
- **Children need to tell their story and express emotions** - Not just receive explanations but actively share their experience
- **Common childhood misunderstandings must be directly addressed** - Guilt, self-blame, and fear of becoming an abuser are predictable and can be corrected
- **The mother must be clear about her own blamelessness** - Both for herself and to model for her child that victims are never at fault
