## The Core Principle: Self-Regulation as Your Primary Responsibility

Beyond keeping your child physically safe and cared for, **your number one responsibility as a parent is managing yourself**. This may seem counterintuitive given all the child-focused responsibilities of parenting, but it is foundational because parenting is inherently difficult and guaranteed to push your buttons. Without the ability to self-regulate, you cannot effectively handle those moments when your buttons get pushed.

**Mindfulness is the foundation of self-regulation.** It means bringing conscious attention to your experience in a non-judgmental, accepting way. When you become more aware of your own feelings, thoughts, and body sensations, you gain the ability to CHOOSE your response instead of getting hijacked by your emotions.

This matters because you may know great parenting skills and strategies, but you cannot use them if you are not calm and centered. Knowledge of techniques is useless in a dysregulated state.

## The Oxygen Mask Analogy

Airlines tell parents to put on their own oxygen masks first for a specific reason: kids cannot reach those masks or be relied on to use them properly. If the parent loses function, kids cannot save the parent or themselves. Even though parents would sacrifice themselves for their children, it remains their responsibility to secure their own mask first because that is the only way to help their child.

This analogy extends directly to emotional regulation: children cannot manage their own rage by themselves. They cannot navigate complex emotions like jealousy that push them to hit a sibling. They cannot work through the fear that they are not good enough or lovable. Children know that if they were "good enough" they would not want to hit, sneak candy, or throw tantrums. But they cannot help themselves, however hard they try not to. This is similar to how adults struggle with behaviors like eating an extra piece of cake despite knowing better.

**When you are stressed out, exhausted, and running on empty, you cannot be there constructively for your child** any more than you could help them if you blacked out on a plane.

## What Mindfulness Actually Means

**Mindfulness is the opposite of "losing" your temper.** However, mindfulness does not mean you do not feel anger. Being mindful means you pay attention to what you are feeling but do not act on it impulsively.

Two definitions that capture this:
- "Mindfulness: Allowing an emotion to take hold and pass without acting on it." (Benedict Carey)
- "Mindfulness: Not hitting someone in the mouth." (11-year-old who completed mindfulness training, quoted in the New York Times)

Anger is part of all relationships. The problem is not feeling anger. **It is acting on anger mindlessly, with words or actions, that compromises parenting and other relationships.**

## The Modeling Effect

If you can stay mindful, noticing your emotions but making a conscious, responsible choice about how to act on them, you model emotional regulation for your children. Children learn by watching us.

Your child is fairly certain to act like a child: someone who is still learning, has different priorities than you, and cannot always manage their feelings or actions. Their childish behavior is guaranteed to push your buttons at times. That is normal. **The problem occurs when parents begin acting like children too.** Someone has to act like a grown-up if we want our child to learn how.

## Understanding Emotions as Dashboard Indicators

**Emotions are useful, like indicator lights on a dashboard.** If you saw a blinking red light in your car, you would not cover it up or tear out the wiring. You would listen to the information and act on it, such as taking your car in for an oil change.

The challenge with human emotions is that we are often confused about what to do when we feel them.

We are hard-wired to respond to all "negative" emotions (cues of "danger" or blinking red lights in your psyche) by fighting or running away. If that does not work, we collapse. These strategies may have helped us through emergencies in childhood and throughout life. **But parenting, despite our fears, is usually not an emergency.**

## Why Pausing Before Reacting Matters

Usually the best response to upsetting emotions is to **pause and restore your nervous system to safety before reacting**.

Two critical reasons:
1. When you are not calm, you cannot help your child feel safe
2. When you are dysregulated, your unpredictable tone and tension can actually trigger your child's nervous system further

This creates a negative feedback loop: your dysregulation triggers your child's nervous system, making the situation worse.

## The Realistic Goal: Returning to Center, Not Staying Centered

**You probably cannot stay centered all the time. What you CAN do is keep returning yourself to center.**

You can count on finding yourself triggered at times. But if you can train yourself to notice when you start to lose it, you have the choice to return yourself back to a state of equilibrium. That peaceful place inside ensures that your actions are wise and loving.

## The Three-Step Process for Returning to Center

### Step 1: Notice When You Are Not Feeling Centered

Recognize the warning signs: getting anxious, annoyed, frustrated, tired, overwhelmed, or shutting down.

### Step 2: Use Your Inner Pause Button - Stop, Drop, and Breathe

This three-part process:
- **Stop** what you are doing
- **Drop** your agenda, just for the moment. Example: Yes, your child has to take a bath. But for this moment, drop your agenda and step away from the fight. The agenda can resume after you regulate.
- **Take a few deep breaths** and blow them out to calm yourself

This stops your slide down the slippery slope toward losing it and allows you to choose a better way.

### Step 3: Shift Your State Toward Love

Consciously choose a thought or action that will make you feel more calm and emotionally generous. It might be as simple as taking a few minutes alone and giving yourself a hug.

Even if you realize you need a big change, take a small action now to move toward a better future. This means making a conscious choice to respond to whatever situation you are in with love, for yourself and for your child.

**Every choice, deep down, is between love and fear. Choose love.**

## The Difficulty of This Work

**It takes practice even to notice when you start the downhill slide.** Even harder, it takes courage and self-discipline to give up your upset in that moment. It is always easier to have your own tantrum.

This is tough work, and invisible. No one sees what it costs you. But the question becomes: **Would you rather be right, or at peace with yourself and your child?**

## The Results of Consistent Practice

While the work may seem invisible, the results will blow you away:
- With practice, you will find yourself calmer most of the time
- Your child will be more cooperative, just because you are different
- When you are in a more peaceful state, some of the challenges with your child will simply begin to melt away

**This work of choosing love over and over stretches your heart as well as your nervous system.** It connects you more deeply with your child. And it makes you happier and more emotionally generous.

The outcome: a family with a lot less drama and a lot more love.

## Key Warnings and Anti-Patterns

**Do not try to suppress or ignore emotions.** The car dashboard analogy emphasizes that covering up a warning light or tearing out the wiring is the wrong approach. Emotions contain useful information.

**Do not treat parenting situations as emergencies when they are not.** Fight-flight-collapse responses served evolutionary purposes but are rarely appropriate for typical parenting challenges.

**Do not expect perfection in staying calm.** The goal is returning to center repeatedly, not maintaining perfect equilibrium.

**Do not act on anger mindlessly.** The problem is not having anger (which is normal in all relationships) but acting on it without conscious choice.
