# Teaching Children Correct Names for Their Genitals

## Core Principle: Comfort Comes from Normalcy

The goal when teaching children words for their body parts is that they feel **comfortable with their bodies, genitals and all**. This comfort is achieved by treating genitals the same as any other body part when it comes to naming them. Using euphemisms signals parental discomfort, which children pick up on. If you can't even name a body part, you're communicating to your child that there's something wrong with it, something shameful or unmentionable.

The analogy that clarifies this: Imagine if your knee was just referred to as "down there." The absurdity highlights how euphemisms create unnecessary mystery and shame around body parts that should be as neutrally named as elbows or shoulders.

## Why Correct Anatomical Terms Matter

### Protection and Communication

Children need to be able to clearly communicate if something happens to them. This applies in two critical scenarios:

1. **Medical situations**: If a two-year-old needs to explain to a caregiver that something is hurting, vague terms like "down there" or "woo-hoo" don't provide useful information.

2. **Safety from inappropriate touch**: If a child needs to report that someone touched them inappropriately, preciseness is critical. Being able to name exactly what happened and where enables adults to understand and respond appropriately.

### Psychological Health and Future Self-Protection

Using correct names lessens shame around sexuality. This has long-term implications: women who feel shame around their body and sexuality are less able to protect themselves from predatory advances. Teaching shame-free body awareness from early childhood builds the foundation for self-protection later in life.

### The Problem with Euphemisms and Derogatory Terms

Even seemingly innocent euphemisms signal that something is wrong with the real words, and therefore something wrong with those parts of the body. Derogatory terms are worse. Terms like "boob" or "tit" for women's breasts are degrading. The pattern of using diminishing language for female body parts reflects and reinforces broader cultural discomfort.

## The Statistical Reality

**95% of three-year-old boys** know the word penis.
**Only 52% of girls the same age** have been given a specific name for their own genitals.

This gap reflects cultural discomfort that is particularly acute around female anatomy.

## Anatomically Correct Terminology for Girls

Most people incorrectly think "vagina" refers to the entire female genitalia. This is wrong.

**The correct terms:**
- **Vulva**: The visible female genitals (the external parts)
- **Vagina**: The internal tube leading from the uterus to the outside of the body (not visible externally)
- **Clitoris**: Part of the vulva; often the first part little girls discover during self-exploration because touching it feels good

The recommendation is to teach all three terms and their locations, just as you would differentiate between a boy's penis, testicles, and scrotum.

## Practical Method: The Bathtub Game

Make learning body part names part of a game during bath time. Point to different parts of the body and have the child identify them:

"Where's your shoulder? Where's your elbow? Where's your vulva? Where are your toes?"

By embedding genitals into a routine naming game alongside neutral body parts, you remove any sense that these parts are different or shameful.

## Addressing Parental Discomfort

If you find it hard to imagine doing this naturally, remember: **your child won't have any embarrassment or shame unless you signal that there's something shameful**. Children take their emotional cues from parents. If you treat the vulva the same as the elbow, your child will too.

The work required is on the parent's side. If you want your daughter to feel good about her body and be able to protect herself, it's worth working through your own discomfort. The discomfort is inherited from culture, not inherent to the situation.

## Key Takeaways

1. Start teaching correct anatomical terms as soon as children can talk
2. Treat genital naming the same as naming any other body part
3. For girls, teach vulva, clitoris, and vagina as distinct parts with distinct locations
4. Use games and natural moments (like bath time) to normalize the vocabulary
5. Your comfort level sets your child's comfort level - work through your own discomfort first
6. Correct terminology serves both psychological health and physical safety
