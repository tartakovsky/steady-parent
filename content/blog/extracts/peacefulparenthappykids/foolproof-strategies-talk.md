# Foolproof Strategies for Getting Kids to Talk

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids

## Core Principle: Connection Creates Communication

The fundamental insight is that children's willingness to talk depends on the quality of the parent-child relationship. When the relationship is close, children don't need to worry about whether to trust parents with delicate information, and they don't need to seize power in the relationship by withholding information. Communication problems are often relationship problems in disguise.

A key quote from Shmuley Boteach captures an important mindset shift: "Most families tend to rush through dinner, especially the kids. They can't wait to get back to their computers and cell phones and iPods. But they'll stick around if the conversation is interesting. And the biggest determinant is YOU. If you see yourself and your life as a crashing bore, your kids will see the same thing. But if you see your life as an endless succession of miraculous and fascinating events, your kids will be transformed by it."

## The Natural Trajectory of Child Communication

Most children talk nonstop during preschool years. By elementary school, many begin to clam up with parents. This is a normal developmental pattern, not a failure. The good news: strategies exist to maintain open communication, and the more children practice talking with parents, the more natural it becomes.

## Strategy 1: Respond to Child-Initiated Conversation Openers

**Why this matters more than parent-initiated conversations:** When a child offers a small conversational opening, how you respond signals whether they can count on you when they truly need to talk. This is far more important than any conversation you try to initiate, such as asking what happened at school.

**The practical challenge:** It can be excruciating to tear yourself away from what you're doing to focus on a child's question. But this responsiveness is crucial for building closeness.

**Age consideration:** This becomes especially important once children are past age eight or so.

**Evidence from teen relationships:** Parents who have close relationships with their teenagers often attribute that closeness to their willingness to be available when their teen signals a desire to talk - even if it's 1am and her boyfriend just broke up with her.

**The risk of deprioritizing:** Teens who feel that other things are more important to their parents often look elsewhere when they're emotionally needy. This is the parent's loss as much as the child's.

## Strategy 2: Ask Questions That Invite Real Answers

**The problem with generic questions:** "How was school today?" typically produces nothing useful because it's too broad and doesn't engage specific memories or experiences.

**Effective question examples:**
- "What was the best thing about school today?"
- "Do the kids at school ever talk about boyfriends and girlfriends?"
- "Who did you sit with at lunch today?"
- "How did the soccer game go at recess?"

**Why these work:** They require real answers by pointing to specific, concrete experiences the child actually had.

**Avoid "why" questions:** Questions that begin with "Why" often make kids defensive.
- **Ineffective:** "Why did you wear that?"
- **Effective:** "What do you think most of the kids will be wearing on the field trip?"

The second version is nonjudgmental and focuses on gathering information rather than implying criticism.

## Strategy 3: Resist Jumping In With Solutions and Advice

**The sequence matters:**
1. First, the child needs a chance to vent
2. They cannot hear advice until they've vented
3. Then they need a chance to figure out their own solutions

**Why holding back builds confidence:** When children work through problems themselves, they develop confidence and competence. When parents jump in with solutions, children feel incompetent.

**A better approach:**
1. Reflect feelings back to the child
2. Help them brainstorm solutions rather than providing solutions

**The result:** Kids find parents more useful to talk to and are more likely to seek them out when they have problems.

**Acknowledging the difficulty:** The author admits this is hard - "I always want to tell my kids what to do. I'm a professional advice-giver, after all!" This validates that restraining the urge to advise is genuinely challenging.

## Strategy 4: Daily One-on-One Connection

**The requirement:** Connect with each child every single day, alone, even if just for a short time.

**Timing opportunity:** Being on hand when children come home is a sure-fire way to hear the highlights of the day. But any time you can get in their space and sync with their energy level works.

**Age-appropriate formats:**
- **Toddlers:** Floor-time
- **Nine year olds:** Snuggle on the couch while chatting about anything - their day at school, the coming weekend, a TV show you watched together
- **Teens:** Develop a little ritual, like sharing a cup of tea every night before bed while catching up

**Managing expectations:** Don't expect your child to invite closeness or volunteer vulnerable emotions at each interaction, or when you expect it. But if you set up enough regular opportunities to be together, it will happen.

## Strategy 5: Build Scheduled Special Time Into Routines

**Example formats:**
- Dad and daughter go to brunch once a month
- Dad and daughter play basketball together once a week
- Mom and son catch up during drives to swim team

**Why routine matters:** Kids often wait for these routine times with their parents to bring up something that's bothering them. The predictability creates a safe container.

## Strategy 6: Evaluate How You Initiate Connection

**When overtures fail, examine your approach:** Are you inviting a positive response?

**Understanding the child's perspective:** Kids have a lot on their minds - the history test, soccer tryouts, the newest computer game. By the time they're tweens, they're swamped with hormones and checking themselves out in every mirror they pass.

**Reframe low parent priority as healthy:** Parents can be dismally low on their list, but that's actually a good sign. Children can take parents for granted because they know parents are there for them. This security, not the constant seeking of parental attention, is the healthy outcome.

**How to approach:** Find ways to get in their face in a friendly, inoffensive way. It's fine to demand and expect connection - you have a right to a relationship with your child. But you're more likely to find the response you want if you can help your child remember why she likes you.

**Contrasting approaches:**
- **Effective:** "I was hoping we could go out for brunch one day this weekend for some special Mom and Alice time"
- **Ineffective:** "You never tell me anything these days!"

The first is inviting; the second is accusatory and creates defensiveness.

## Strategy 7: Handle Hurtful Responses Without Anger

**Common hurtful responses:** Disdain, sarcasm, or blankness when you make an overture.

**Why not to respond with anger:** Responding with anger arouses their ire by attacking back, which escalates the conflict.

**The recommended response:**
1. Show vulnerability and hurt
2. Say "Ouch!" and turn away
3. Leave before you give in to the temptation to lash out

**Why this works:** Your child will almost certainly feel badly about having hurt you, especially since you haven't aroused their ire by attacking back.

**Internal reframe:** Remind yourself that the slight was probably unintentional and that being close to your child is your priority.

**Follow-up conversation (when not upset):**
1. Use a light touch to tell your child how much you wanted to connect
2. Express how hurt you were
3. Your child will probably apologize and learn something about relating civilly

**If they don't apologize:** This is an indication that your relationship needs repair work and a heart-to-heart is in order.

**Heart-to-heart conversation structure:**
1. Reaffirm how much you love your child and want to be close
2. State your commitment to a home where everyone treats each other with respect
3. Ask what they think is getting in the way of a loving relationship between you
4. Listen to what they say
5. Let go of your defensiveness
6. Repeat back what they said (reflective listening)
7. Take responsibility for anything you can
8. Resist making it their fault
9. Thank them for sharing
10. Reaffirm your desire to stay connected

## Strategy 8: Stay Available Without Pressing

**How kids operate:** Most kids don't keep an agenda and bring things up at a scheduled meeting. Kids talk when something is up for them.

**What makes kids clam up:** Nothing makes them clam up faster than pressing them to talk.

**Conditions for opening up:** Kids talk particularly when you've proven yourself to be a good listener, but you're not overly attached to their opening up to you.

**The power dynamic trap:** If you act like the information they have is a gem you need, they often won't be able to resist that power and will become even more tight-fisted about sharing. The perceived power of withholding can become more appealing than the benefits of sharing.

**Age-specific approaches for young kids:**
- Young kids usually talk with no hesitancy
- Ask questions while in the car
- Ask questions while they do art or build things
- Pick up a crayon or a block yourself - this creates more connection and more likelihood that they'll share their thoughts

**With older kids, relationship quality determines openness:** If the relationship is close, they won't need to worry about whether to trust you with delicate information, and they won't need to seize a rare chance for power by withholding information.

**If your child isn't opening up:** Spend time strengthening the relationship rather than pushing for communication directly.

**Privacy consideration:** Remember that teens cherish their right to privacy. Resist being intrusive.

**Proximity strategies:**
- Never waste a car ride
- Never waste a simple task like folding laundry together
- Simply being in the same room can create opportunity for interaction
- If you're cooking dinner and she's doing her nails or homework, there's often an opening

**What limits interaction:** If one of you is hunched over the computer, interaction will be limited. Find ways to be in proximity where you're both potentially available, without it seeming like a demand.

**Stating availability (works even with teens):**
- "I'll be in the kitchen making dinner if you want me"
- "I have to run to the grocery store, but don't hesitate to call my cell phone if you need me"

**The deeper dimension:** The most important part of staying available is a state of mind. Your child will sense your emotional availability. Physical proximity without emotional availability doesn't work.

## Strategy 9: Use Indirect Communication

**When kids often open up more:**
- In the car
- On a walk
- In the dark

**Why these contexts work:** All are times when eye contact is limited. Reduced eye contact reduces the intensity and vulnerability of the interaction.

**Another indirect opportunity:** When their friends are over, or in your car. Keep your mouth shut and listen. Your kid knows you're there, of course, but is often more willing to talk than if you were interacting directly.

## Strategy 10: Listen (The Most Important Strategy)

**The core instruction:** Don't talk, listen.

**Active listening technique:**
1. Reflect back what they're saying so they know you understand
2. Then be quiet so they can talk more
3. If they don't keep talking, you can ask another question

**Tone guidance:** Keep your tone companionable, not interrogatory. The difference between a conversation and an interrogation is the feeling of being questioned versus the feeling of being understood and accompanied.
