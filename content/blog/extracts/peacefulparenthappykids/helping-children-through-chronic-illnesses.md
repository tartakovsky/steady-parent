## The Situation: An 11-Year-Old with Juvenile Arthritis

A parent writes about her 11-year-old daughter diagnosed with Juvenile Arthritis about a year ago. Despite treatment and medication, the child still experiences:

- Flare-ups and pain in her hips, knees, and elbows
- Fatigue that comes and goes (some weeks she can participate normally; other days she can barely walk)
- Mood swings partly caused by medication
- Emotional distress: crying, screaming that life is unfair, anger at having to take daily medicine, get weekly shots, and visit doctors constantly
- Social struggles at a new school where girls won't play with her (she believes it's because of her limping)
- A dilemma about whether to continue cheerleading - the one activity she loves and has done for 5 years

Before getting sick, she was "the happiest, most cheerful child ever."

## Understanding the Child's Anger

The child's anger is completely natural and has multiple sources:

1. **Pain makes anyone miserable** - Physical pain naturally leads to frustration and readiness to lash out
2. **Loss of normal activities** - She cannot do things most children take for granted
3. **Life dominated by illness** - Her whole life has become "medical-ized"
4. **Fear of being different** - At 11, children are intensely worried about peer acceptance

**Key insight:** This would be a lot for anyone to handle, let alone an 11-year-old.

## Medical Considerations to Explore

While the advice focuses on psychology rather than medicine, several medical questions are worth exploring:

- **Medication and mood swings:** Are the doctors aware the medication may be causing mood swings? This needs to be addressed. Meditation could help with mood stabilization.
- **Pain management alternatives:** If current medicine doesn't provide adequate pain relief, hypnosis can be explored. It has no side effects and is very empowering.
- **Diet options:** There are compelling accounts linking "leaky gut syndrome" with autoimmune diseases like Juvenile Arthritis.

## Strategy 1: Let Her Cry and Scream

### Why This Matters

It IS unfair. She has every right to be upset.

### How to Respond When She Lashes Out

- **Stay with her** - Don't withdraw
- **Empathize** with how upset she is
- **Don't let her hurt you**, but stay kind and calm
- Keep an **emotional bridge** with your soothing voice
- **Accept her rage** - This allows her to access the grief underneath

### The Deeper Process

If you accept her rage, she will go under it to her **grief** - grief for the life she has lost and will never have. That grief is huge because the loss is huge.

### Your Role as Parent

Part of you wants your happy girl back. But before she can adjust, she has to accept this situation, and that means grieving. Your job is to accept her feelings and empathize about how mad - and how sad - she is.

---

## Strategy 2: Give Her Other Outlets for Grief and Rage

### Art as Therapy

Art is a wonderful way for children to process emotion.

**Pounding clay** can be therapeutic - it provides a physical outlet for anger.

**Drawing her upset:** Encourage her to "draw" her upset on grumpy days. It doesn't have to look like anything to be therapeutic.

### How to Respond to Her Art

Use neutral, observational language:
- "I see you used a lot of blue today"
- "I see a lot of energy in this drawing"
- "Tell me about this picture"

Then: **Listen, empathize, and hug her.**

### Showing You Value the Process

Put dates on her artwork and keep it in a big folder or portfolio. This communicates that you value her art and see value in her self-expression, even when it's about pain.

---

## Strategy 3: Process Your Own Pain First

### Why This Is Essential

In order to stay calm with your daughter when she is upset, it's important that you have a way to process your own pain about her situation.

### Methods for Self-Care

- Journal
- Cry
- Talk to a friend or counselor

### The Goal

Your daughter has a lot of crying to do, and she needs you to have worked through your own emotions enough that you can deal with the rawness of her pain.

### What Happens Without This

Without processing your own emotions, it would be natural for you to find her pain unbearable and to give her the message to shut it down. But repression won't work here.

### Your Role

She needs to express her pain to a **brave, compassionate witness** - you.

---

## Strategy 4: Stay Positive While Empathizing

### The Balance

Empathize with your daughter's grief and rage, but keep your expectations high.

### Avoid the "Poor Me" Attitude

Kids who have a "poor me" attitude are cultivating a chip on their shoulder and a sense of powerlessness. That's not what you want.

### What to Communicate Instead

- She is a **unique individual with much to contribute** to the world
- Everyone has trials; hers just came earlier than most
- You know she is **strong enough to make it through** even this

### Maintain Normal Expectations

Expect her to:
- Do well academically
- Find other passions (art, music, writing, reading)
- Be a kind and compassionate person (even if sometimes she can't be because she's too pained or angry)
- Pull her weight in the family by doing chores she can handle (just like siblings, if she has any)

**Note:** If she has siblings, be sure to spend one-on-one time with them every day, as well as with her.

### Making Meaning of the Situation

Your daughter is trying to make sense of a very unfair situation. You can completely validate that unfairness while understanding that she has unique gifts in spite of her burden - and maybe even because of her burden.

Even if you're not spiritual, you can communicate your belief that **we can all lead meaningful lives that make a contribution, even those of us with a chronic illness**.

## Strategy 5: Use Books to Help Process Emotion

Books are a great way to help children process emotion. Stories about characters facing challenges can help children feel less alone and provide frameworks for understanding their own experiences.

---

## Strategy 6: Play Physical Games with Her

### The Underlying Need

One issue she's grappling with is that she doesn't feel physically capable. She needs an antidote to that.

### Specific Activities

- **Wrestle with her and let her win** - This gives her a sense of physical power and victory
- **Push hands:** Put your hands against hers, let her push at you, push you across the room while you resist (a bit) and even push you over

### The Importance for Girls with Physical Issues

Lawrence Cohen (author of "Playful Parenting") believes it is important for all girls to gain a sense of their physical power. For a child with physical issues, it's even more imperative.

## Strategy 7: Help Her Make a Friend

### The Core Need

Your daughter needs a friend, and she needs your support to make one.

### Steps to Take

1. **Talk to the teacher:**
   - Is it true the other girls won't play with her because she's limping?
   - Does the teacher have ideas about a child your daughter could become friends with?
   - Can the teacher pair her with another girl for a special project?

2. **Build on any opportunities:**
   - Invite a potential friend over to work on a project
   - Take them for ice cream together

3. **Explore other options:**
   - What happened to her friends from before her illness?
   - Is there a club at school where she could make friends with the same interests?

### Why This Is Priority

It is painful to be different, and maybe especially so at age 11. Finding ways to promote friendships needs to be **at the top of your family list**.

### Additional Support She May Need

- Help coming up with lines to "explain" her limping
- Possibly participation in a social skills group so she has skills to make good connections

## Strategy 8: Connect with a Support Group

### Benefits for Your Daughter

Contact a local juvenile arthritis support group. It will be **empowering** for your daughter to connect with other kids going through the same thing.

### Benefits for You

It will also be a relief to you, giving you both emotional and informational support.

---

## Strategy 9: Encourage Her Passions (Don't Pull Her from Cheerleading)

### Why This Matters

Your daughter needs something in her life that she loves and that makes her happy. Right now, that thing is cheerleading.

### Why Removing It Would Be a Mistake

Even though the father feels it's too much for her, pulling her from cheerleading would be a mistake. She needs it right now.

### The Value of Participation, Even Limited

Even if she just sits on the side and learns the cheers, the bonds with the other kids are very important to her right now.

### What Will Likely Happen

She will become more and more frustrated with cheerleading, almost certainly. At some point, she will most likely tell you she is ready to stop. **Let her make that call.**

### Preparing for the Future

Work with her to discover another passion in the meantime. There are many passions that don't depend on physical strength.

### The Deeper Message

Your daughter is being sent in another direction. Help her learn to listen to those messages.

---

## The Overarching Truth

Kids can make it through almost anything, as long as they have a parent who **listens to all their pain and walks through it with them**.

That's not easy, but it is the greatest gift you can give her.

### A Final Perspective

Remember that sometimes our greatest tragedies are also our greatest gifts, in ways we could never have foreseen.

## Key Themes

**Acceptance before adjustment:** Before a child can adjust to chronic illness, she must accept the situation - and that requires grieving. Don't rush the grief.

**Witness, don't fix:** The parent's role is to be a brave, compassionate witness to the child's pain, not to make it go away or shut it down.

**Maintain expectations:** Empathize with pain while still holding high expectations. The child is not defined by her illness.

**Process your own emotions:** You cannot witness your child's pain if you haven't processed your own emotions about her situation.

**Preserve what brings joy:** Don't remove the activities that bring happiness, even if they seem "too much." Let the child decide when she's ready to stop.

**Social connection is critical:** At 11, peer acceptance is paramount. Finding ways to help her make friends should be a top family priority.

**Physical empowerment matters:** A child who doesn't feel physically capable needs experiences that restore a sense of physical power.

**Community support:** Both child and parent benefit from connecting with others going through similar experiences.
