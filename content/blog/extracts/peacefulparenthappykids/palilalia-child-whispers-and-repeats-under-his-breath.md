## What Is Palilalia

**Palilalia** is the behavior of repeating one's own words to oneself, usually (though not always) under one's breath. A typical example: a child says "I'm going to draw a picture" aloud, then whispers "draw a picture" to themselves immediately afterward.

Children who do this often do not realize they are speaking aloud. When asked about it, they may say "I only said that to myself" because they believe the words stayed in their head. This lack of awareness is normal and not a sign that anything is wrong.

## Why Children Develop This Behavior

### Palilalia as a Nervous Tic

This behavior is usually classified as a **nervous tic**. Many children develop minor nervous tics that appear and then fade away on their own. Other examples of such tics include minor stutters or eye twitches.

The pattern follows a predictable trajectory: the child experiences some form of stress (such as starting school, gaining a new sibling, or mastering a developmental milestone like bike riding or reading). The tic emerges during this stressful period. Once the child masters the challenge or adjusts to the new situation, the tic naturally fades.

### Palilalia as an Expression of Anxiety

Adults who remember doing this as children describe several underlying motivations:
- **Double-checking correctness**: Making sure they said something the "right" way
- **Self-organization**: Using the repetition to mentally organize themselves
- **Narration**: Telling themselves the story of their own lives as it happens

These adults often report doing this for about **a year** before outgrowing it. Some say they still do it internally (in their heads) and view it as a manifestation of a tendency toward perfectionism.

### Palilalia as a Distraction Mechanism

Beyond anxiety expression, palilalia may serve as a way for children to **distract themselves from uncomfortable feelings or thoughts**.

The mechanism works like this: an unwanted thought or image intrudes (for example, remembering a conflict that triggers self-criticism). To escape the discomfort, the mind latches onto something in the immediate environment and repeats it. This could be a sign the child sees, something someone just said, or their own recent words.

This is actually a common mental defense mechanism. Some people develop a specific phrase that pops into their head to "change the subject" internally, such as "Ok, what else?" Anyone can observe this pattern operating in their own stream of thoughts if they pay attention.

## Assessing the Situation

### Questions to Ask About Your Child's Life

Look for sources of stress and consider how to minimize them:
- Has something new or challenging entered their life recently?
- Does the child seem anxious in other ways?
- Does the child show signs of perfectionism?

If perfectionism or anxiety appears more broadly, the book **"Freeing Your Child from Anxiety" by Tamar Chansky** is recommended as a resource.

### When to Be Concerned

Repeating things under one's breath can occasionally indicate a neurological disorder such as **Autism, Tourette's syndrome, or OCD**. However, these conditions would almost certainly present with other obvious and more concerning symptoms.

If palilalia is the only unusual behavior and there are no other worrying signs, assume it does NOT indicate a major issue. That said, if the behavior continues, mention it to the pediatrician at the next visit as a precaution.

## How to Respond (and What Not to Do)

### What Does Not Help

**Pestering the child about the behavior does not help.** Drawing attention to it primarily makes the child self-conscious. Since most children believe they are saying the words internally (not aloud), pointing it out can feel confusing and shaming.

**Power struggles are ineffective.** The child probably cannot control this behavior through willpower alone because it functions as an anxiety management mechanism.

### The Recommended Approach

Rather than addressing the symptom directly, **address the underlying anxiety**. This is more effective because it targets the root cause rather than fighting against a coping mechanism the child needs.

Be aware that like other anxiety management behaviors, palilalia can become habitual. This is why addressing the underlying cause early is beneficial before the behavior becomes deeply ingrained.

### If the Child Wants Help Stopping

If the child gets teased at school and expresses a desire to break the habit, you can offer to help. Key points:

- This requires **enormous effort on the child's part**
- It is only possible **if the child is genuinely committed** to changing
- **If the child is not motivated, parental input will not help**

One technique that can work: teach the child to take a deep breath and let it out after speaking. This serves two purposes:
1. It **discharges the anxiety** that would otherwise fuel the repetition
2. It **shifts the habit** to something less noticeable to others

However, if the child is not interested in changing, **back off**. Pushing the issue implies there is something wrong with the child, which creates shame and additional anxiety. The child will almost certainly outgrow this on their own.

## Reassurance and Perspective

### Natural Resolution

This behavior typically resolves on its own within about a year as the child either masters the stressor that triggered it or simply develops beyond the phase.

### Positive Framing

**Albert Einstein** went through a period around age six where he whispered everything he said to himself. Palilalia is reportedly **most common in highly intelligent children**.

This historical example and association with intelligence can help parents reframe the behavior from a source of worry to simply an interesting quirk of their child's development.

## Summary of Key Principles

1. **Palilalia is usually a temporary nervous tic** triggered by stress or developmental challenges
2. **The child is typically unaware** they are speaking aloud
3. **It serves as an anxiety management mechanism** and possibly a distraction from uncomfortable thoughts
4. **Do not pester or call attention to it** as this creates self-consciousness without helping
5. **Address underlying anxiety** rather than fighting the symptom directly
6. **Only help the child stop if they specifically want to** and are motivated
7. **Deep breathing after speaking** can be taught as an alternative habit if the child wants to change
8. **Mention it to the pediatrician** if it persists, but do not assume the worst unless other concerning symptoms exist
9. **Most children outgrow this naturally** within about a year
10. **The behavior is associated with intelligence** and is nothing to be ashamed of
