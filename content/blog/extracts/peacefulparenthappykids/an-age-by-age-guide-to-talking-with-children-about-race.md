# Talking With Children About Race: An Age-by-Age Guide

## Core Premise: Why Parents Must Address Race

Raising children in a highly racialized society creates a parental responsibility to consider the messages we transmit about racial identity. These messages are powerful because they shape children's identities, relationships, and opinions. More importantly, these early messages form the filter through which children will later interpret the negative messages about race that permeate our culture.

White families often ignore racism because it makes them uncomfortable and because they assume it doesn't affect their children. However, **racism dehumanizes all of us** - not just people of color. We can only end racism by:
- Talking with all children about how unfair it is
- Admitting that all of us have a tendency to judge people based on appearance
- Pointing out the terrible cost to people of color and to our entire society
- Teaching children that treating all people fairly matters

Because adults struggle with these issues themselves, they will often struggle to know how to talk to children about them. But that doesn't eliminate the responsibility to do so.

## The Ongoing Conversation Framework

There is never one single conversation about such a big issue. Parents need to talk repeatedly about these tough issues on an ongoing basis as they arise. Opportunities emerge from:
- Current events that create natural discussion openings
- Personal life experiences
- Questions children ask

If we want things to be different in the next generation, we must begin these discussions in our homes. It's better to have ongoing age-appropriate discussions than to avoid the topic entirely.

## Why "Color-Blind" Is the Wrong Approach

### The Research Problem
Many parents grew up believing color-blindness was the best approach. Research contradicts this assumption. Children perceive racial differences at a very young age and are curious about them. When adults ignore these differences, children get the message that race is a shameful topic that cannot be discussed. **Silence about race reinforces racism.**

### The Invalidation Problem
The color-blind approach invalidates the experience of children of color, who are all too aware that society is not color-blind and that their race is a factor in how they are treated.

### The Better Alternative: Color-Fair and Color-Rich
Instead of teaching children to be color-blind, we can teach children to be:
- **Color-fair**: advocating for fair treatment of all people
- **Color-rich**: appreciative of all skin tones, empathic with the experiences of all people

The framing should be: We're all different, and that makes the world a richer place. No race or color is better than another. Address race in a positive way - how wonderful that everyone brings their own unique contribution to the world.

### The Unconscious Bias Factor
White parents need to recognize that we have all grown up in a culture with institutional racism. This means we must notice any ways in which we might inadvertently give our child impressions about race that aren't what we consciously want to promote.

## When to Start: The Research Evidence

Begin talking with children early. **By kindergarten, many children have already formed opinions about race, including valuing lighter skin more than darker skin.** Race is an intense topic, but we can have age-appropriate discussions from the time children are toddlers.

## Age-by-Age Guide

### Toddlers

**Common misconception**: A toddler is too young to notice race.

**Reality from research**: Toddlers do notice racial differences. Many white parents avoid mentioning race because they're afraid that discussing difference will create racist ideas. This fear is misguided.

**Key behaviors**:
- When your toddler asks questions about race, don't "shush" them, even if the question seems disrespectful
- Acknowledge the question in a positive way

**Example response**: "Yes, Diego's skin is darker than yours. It's beautiful, isn't it? Everyone's skin is different."

**The silence problem**: They may not comment, but when you don't talk about it, they assume the conversation is off-limits.

**Parent self-awareness**: Notice your own reactions that may be influenced by race and what cues you're giving your child. Initiate small conversations that communicate your observations and values.

### Preschoolers (Ages 3-5)

**Developmental context**: Preschoolers are very concerned about fairness and believe everyone should be treated fairly. They definitely notice race and draw conclusions based on what they perceive.

**Required approach**: Have ongoing discussions about:
- Race
- The value of diversity
- Fairness
- Standing up for what's right

**Handling direct questions**:
- Be prepared for questions like "Why is that girl's skin brown?"
- Keep answers simple

**Example response**: "One of her parents must have given her that beautiful brown skin, just like you got your red hair from your daddy."

**Handling potentially racist remarks**:
1. Take a deep breath
2. Ask them what made them say that
3. Use the opportunity to have a discussion about your own beliefs about fair treatment, empathy, and the value of diversity

### Elementary Schoolers (Ages 6-10)

**Developmental context**: Children this age are old enough to hear about current events from friends or online. Be prepared for questions about race along with other current events.

**Approach**:
1. Ask what they've heard
2. Open a discussion about it
3. Tailor your explanation to your child's developmental understanding

**Discussion-starting questions**:
- "Have you ever felt like someone had an opinion about you based on what you look like? How did that feel? Do you think that was fair?"

**Educate about racial injustice**: Don't feel like you have to know everything. You can start a project to look things up and learn together.

**Topics to cover**: Many White parents talk about heroes like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, and about slavery. We also need to talk about:
- Institutionalized racism
- Privilege

**Key principle**: No one is born a racist. Racism is the product of a racist system that is perpetuated with racist assumptions that permeate our institutions and shape our belief systems.

**Teaching method**: These are tough issues to discuss even with adults. The easiest way to teach children about them is with stories.

**Concrete example that illustrates privilege**:
A parent running to catch a bus with their ten-year-old son used this as a teaching moment. After getting on the bus, they explained that African-American friends had forbidden their son to run in public, even to catch a bus. They were afraid a police officer would assume he was running from a crime and should be apprehended. Former Attorney General Eric Holder tells a story of how this happened to him when he was already a federal prosecutor. This evolved into a discussion about privilege that the child has always remembered. Over years, that ongoing conversation was amplified by the child's own experiences, such as watching friends of color get stopped and searched by police officers while White children were never searched.

**Another illustrative example of the reality for people of color**:
Cory Booker, US Senator from New Jersey, graduated from Stanford, was honored as a Rhodes Scholar, and was stopped by six police officers with their guns drawn. They held him for half an hour as a dangerous criminal, barking at him "I said don't move!" while he was on his knees praying and shaking. White children protected from such situations by the color of their skin would have been shaking and praying too, but would probably have tried to assert their rights. Booker didn't dare to do so.

**Always end discussions positively**: Reassure your child that:
- Change is possible
- Many people are working to make things better
- Progress is slow but real
- There are things they can do to help

**Empowerment principle**: It's important for children to think they can make even a small difference in addressing the injustices they see.

### Preteens and Teens

**Developmental context**: Preteens and Teens are exploring their identities, working out how they fit into the world, and how they can make a contribution.

**Approach**: Go into even more depth discussing current events.

**Discussion questions to ask**:
- "Can you think of examples of our individual or group actions and perceptions being shaped by racist ideas that we might not even notice?"
- "When we see injustice, we all have a responsibility to intervene. Some people call that being actively anti-racist. Can you imagine being in a position where you need to take a stand against racism? What might be hard about that? What might you do?"
- "Are there smaller, every-day ways for us to be anti-racist?"

**The action principle**: Taking positive action to address problems they perceive and make the world a better place helps empower teens and keeps them from becoming cynical. Talk with your child about how he or she can take a stand against racism. Brainstorm with them.

**Concrete action ideas**:
- Join a peaceful protest in your town
- Donate to organizations trying to make change, protecting Black lives, or educating people about racism (have the teen research to find an organization whose mission they admire)
- Send a letter to your local mayor or government asking what they are doing to prevent police brutality in your town

## Different Conversations for Different Races

The experience of racism is a daily occurrence for families of color, so it's a frequent discussion in many African American, Hispanic, and Asian homes in the U.S.

**The heartbreak**: Parents of color must explain to their child that the color of his skin means he may not be treated fairly by our society, that he runs even the risk of death if he happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

**What cannot be said**: It would be facile - and just plain not true - to say "Stay out of trouble and you'll be fine." Examples of unarmed African American men and women who have been killed during encounters with police are easy to find.

Each parent will have a somewhat different perspective, so what they choose to say might be different.

## The Learning Process for White Parents

This is an educational process for White parents as well. Don't be afraid to say you also are just learning and are trying to understand. There are many resources online to educate ourselves and our children.
