# Why Children Don't Listen Until You Tell Them Five Times

## Core Philosophy: Self-Discipline vs. Obedience

The fundamental distinction this article draws is between **obedience** and **self-discipline**. Obedience means discipline comes from outside the child - the child does what they're told because of external pressure. Self-discipline means the child WANTS to cooperate and chooses to follow through from an internal motivation.

This distinction matters because:
- Obedient children do what they're told no matter what's right
- Self-disciplined children do what's right no matter what they're told
- The goal of parenting should be raising children who can think for themselves and stand up for what's right

As H.L. Mencken put it: "Morality is doing what's right no matter what you're told. Obedience is doing what you're told no matter what's right."

## The Eight Reasons Children Don't Listen (And What To Do About Each)

### 1. Children Don't Share Parents' Priorities

**Why this happens:** No child understands why a bath is essential. Every child is in the middle of something that seems more important to them. A child's play is their work - it's how young humans learn. This is actually a positive trait because you want a self-motivated child rather than one who expects you to entertain them.

**The solution has two steps:**

First, connect with your child by noticing what they're working on and acknowledging their priorities. Example: "Wow, look at this elaborate structure you're building! Can you show me how it works?"

Second, give them a warning that you're about to overrule their agenda with your own. Example: "Liam, it's bath time. Do you want to take your bath now, or in five minutes? Ok, five minutes with no fuss? Ok, that's a deal - let's shake on it!"

The logic here: By acknowledging their priorities first, you show respect for their autonomy, which makes them more willing to cooperate when you do override their agenda.

### 2. Parents Have Trained Children Not To Pay Attention Until Yelling Begins

**Why this happens:** Children are smart. They know they can milk extra time before bath if they just ignore you. This doesn't make them bad - it makes them human. If your child ignores five requests before complying, it means you've trained them that you aren't serious until you yell.

**The solution involves changing your approach entirely:**

Instead of giving directives from across the room, move in close to your child and touch them. Connect by commenting on what they're doing. Then say "Excuse me, Isabel... I need to tell you something" and wait until they look you in the eye.

If they're staring at a screen, warn them that you're going to pause the game or TV. Don't give your directive until you make eye contact, so they know you're serious. If they're glazed over from watching a screen, ask them to repeat back what you've said.

**Critical instruction:** Give only ONE warning, then stick to the time limit you've agreed on. Follow through. If you don't, you're training them not to take your requests seriously.

### 3. Children Need Help Making Transitions

**Why this happens:** When you're engrossed in your computer screen, you find it hard to pull yourself away to tend to a whining child. Kids experience repeated nagging the same way parents experience whining - they try to tune it out.

**The solution involves active parental involvement in the transition:**

Give one warning. When you go back in five minutes, connect again by commenting on their play: "Wow, look at those trains go!" Then remind them of your deal: "Ok, Noah, it's been five minutes. Remember our deal? Five minutes and no fuss. It's bath time now."

Then create a bridge from their play to what you're asking. Example: "Do you want the two engines to leap off the track and race all the way to the bathroom? Here, I'll take this one and you take that one; Let's zoom!"

**Key insight:** Parents can't just walk away and expect children not to test limits. It's the parent's job to supervise and support them to make progress toward the goal. It's the parent's goal, after all, and the child's motivation only comes from their connection with the parent.

### 4. The Frontal Cortex Is Still Developing

**Why this happens:** Children's frontal cortex is still developing the ability to switch gears from what they want to what you want. Every time you set a limit that requires your child to give up what they want in order to do what you want, they have to make a choice.

**The neurological process:** When a child decides that their relationship with you is more important than what they want at this moment, they follow your request. Every time they do that, they're strengthening the neural pathways in their brain that help them redirect themselves toward a higher goal. This is how kids develop self-discipline.

**Critical caveat:** This only works if the child switches gears somewhat willingly. If you drag them kicking and screaming, they're resisting rather than choosing. They're not building those self-discipline neural pathways. There's a "self" in "self-discipline" because it's chosen from inside.

**The solution:** Set limits with empathy so the child WANTS to cooperate, and gets plenty of practice exercising their brain to choose the higher goal.

### 5. Children Don't Feel Heard and Feel Pushed Around

**Why this happens:** Parents can't MAKE children obey unless they're willing to hurt their bodies and break their spirits. Children have to WANT to cooperate. Children usually give parents the benefit of the doubt and follow rules, as long as they feel heard and have at least a little bit of control or choice.

**The solution involves acknowledging perspective and offering choices:**

Acknowledge their perspective. If possible, give them a choice. Example: "I hear you. You're saying it loud and clear - NO BATH! You really don't want to take a bath. I bet when you're older you'll NEVER take a bath, right?... And tonight you do need to get clean in the water. You have a choice. You can choose a bath or a shower or a sponge bath. Which sounds like the most fun?"

**Important flexibility:** Sometimes, hearing your child's perspective might even convince you to compromise or change your position. That's fine. Just explain your reasoning, so your child knows that it was their win/win solution that changed your mind, not their obstinacy.

### 6. Children Feel Disconnected From Parents

**Why this happens:** When kids don't follow parental lead, it's often because they feel disconnected. Reasons for disconnection include:
- They were away from you all day
- You lost your temper at them that morning
- They're angry because you always have the baby on your lap
- You rely on timeouts and consequences for discipline instead of connection
- They're a little person in a big world, and that gets scary, and all those scary feelings get pushed down inside, where they block the child's ability to lovingly connect

**The solution involves constant connection rebuilding:**

Constantly rebuild connection by empathizing with your child's experience, both when you're giving a directive and as often as you can all day long.

**What to expect:** Be prepared for any upset feelings to surface once your child feels that warm connection more strongly, because that makes your child feel safer. Stay compassionate through the resulting meltdown. After they've had a chance to "show" you the upset that's been weighing on them, your child will feel reconnected and more cooperative.

### 7. Children Have Given Up On Parents

**Why this happens:** Children naturally look to their parents for nurturing and guidance. If they're convinced that parents are on their side, they want to please them. So if a child is defiant, or you keep finding yourself in power struggles, that's a red flag that the relationship needs strengthening.

**The solution: Special Time**

Half an hour of **Special Time**, one-on-one, daily. This seems so simple that most parents underestimate the impact. But Special Time has never failed to strengthen the parent-child relationship, which always helps children want to cooperate more. Special Time also helps children work through whatever issues they're grappling with at the moment, so it makes children happier and emotionally healthier.

**Additional tool: Laughter**

Laughter bonds you with your child, and roughhousing is usually the easiest way to get laughter going. Every child needs belly laughs and giggling both morning and evening to stay connected. When a relationship feels tense, laughter is often the easiest way back to connection.

### 8. Children Are Human

**Why this happens:** Force creates push-back. All humans resist control, and kids are no different. When kids feel "pushed around," the strong-willed kids will rebel, and the more compliant kids will lose initiative and the ability to stand up for themselves.

**The solution involves coaching rather than controlling:**

Choose your battles. Make sure your child knows you're on their side and they have some choices. Coach your child rather than trying to control them.

**The benefit:** Listening to your child raises a person who can think for themselves, stand up for what's right, and isn't likely to be taken advantage of.

## Common Misdiagnosis: The "Parents Want Kids' Approval" Accusation

A common criticism in discussions about "spoiled" children is that kids ignore parents because "parents want their kids' approval" and "worry that we're going to damage kids by frustrating them."

**The article rejects this explanation.** Using the opening example of a father who asked his eight-year-old five times to take a bath: This father wasn't afraid to set a limit because he wanted his son's approval. The real reason his son didn't follow directives was that the dad didn't follow through on his limit. He had trained his child to ignore him. And he most likely finished the evening with shouting or smacking, which decrease the child's respect and connection, and therefore decrease future cooperation.

## The Effort Investment Perspective

Setting empathic limits sounds like a lot of work, and it is - in the beginning. It would certainly be easier if kids would immediately comply with every directive with no questions asked.

**The payoff:** Following these practices consistently not only raises a self-disciplined child, it raises a child who knows you'll follow through, so they don't need to be asked five times to do something. This actually makes it a whole lot easier to get them into the bathtub in the long run.

## Summary of Core Tactics

1. **Connect before directing** - Acknowledge what the child is doing before asking them to stop
2. **Give warnings and make deals** - "Five minutes with no fuss"
3. **Move close and make eye contact** - Don't give directives from across the room
4. **Give only one warning, then follow through** - Inconsistency trains children to ignore you
5. **Create bridges** - Help transition from their activity to yours through play
6. **Set limits with empathy** - So children WANT to cooperate
7. **Acknowledge their perspective** - Let them feel heard
8. **Offer choices when possible** - Bath, shower, or sponge bath?
9. **Daily Special Time** - Half an hour one-on-one
10. **Use laughter** - Especially roughhousing, morning and evening
11. **Coach rather than control** - Choose your battles

## What Not To Do

- Don't give directives from across the room
- Don't repeat requests multiple times (this trains children that you're not serious)
- Don't walk away and expect children not to test limits
- Don't drag children kicking and screaming (they resist rather than choose, building no self-discipline)
- Don't rely on timeouts and consequences instead of connection
- Don't finish with shouting or smacking (decreases respect, connection, and future cooperation)
- Don't mistake obedience for the goal (self-discipline is the real goal)
