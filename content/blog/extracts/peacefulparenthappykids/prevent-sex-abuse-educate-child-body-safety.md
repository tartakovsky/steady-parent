# Preventing Child Sexual Abuse Through Body Safety Education

## Understanding the Real Risks

### The Myth of Stranger Danger

Parents commonly believe that warning children about strangers is sufficient protection against sexual abuse. This assumption is dangerously incomplete. **85 to 90 percent of sexual abuse is committed by someone the child knows and trusts** - parents, step-parents, coaches, teachers, older cousins or siblings, religious leaders, or babysitters. A 2011 ATSA (Association for the Treatment & Prevention of Sexual Abuse) report found that **34 percent of child sexual abuse offenders are family members** of the child.

### The Risk From Other Children

Parents often assume children are safe when not left unsupervised with unfamiliar adults. However, a 2000 Criminal Justice Source Statistics report found that **the average age of sex offenders is 14**. Because this is an average, many offenders are younger than 14, engaging in activity with other children that constitutes sexual abuse. This means risk exists even when children play unsupervised with other children.

### Prevalence Statistics

Sexual abuse is a risk for every child. Many researchers estimate that **one out of four girls and one out of six boys** will encounter unwanted sexual touching before age 18.

### When to Start These Conversations

Parents often hesitate to discuss this topic with young children, not wanting to introduce upsetting content to innocent minds. The answer is that body safety education can begin from infancy, framed in an empowering way that protects without traumatizing.

## Core Teaching Strategies

### 1. Use Books as Conversation Starters

Add body safety books to your child's bookshelf and read them periodically. These books serve as jumping-off points for asking questions that reinforce your protective messages. The story format makes difficult topics approachable and gives children language and scenarios to reference.

### 2. Teach Correct Anatomical Terms Early

Teach children the correct terms for their body parts as soon as they can talk. The reasoning is twofold:

1. **Communication clarity**: If a child is touched inappropriately, they need to clearly communicate what happened to you or other authorities. Vague terms create confusion and can delay intervention.

2. **Reducing shame**: Correct anatomical names normalize body parts and lessen shame around sexuality. Consider: if your knee was only referred to as "down there," it would seem shameful or secretive. The same principle applies to genitals.

### 3. Define and Explain Private Parts

Teach your child that the parts covered by a swimsuit - penis, vulva, vagina, bottom, breasts, and nipples - are called **private parts**. Explain that:

- Private parts are called "private" because they are personal and sacred
- These body parts may someday be used to make a baby when the child grows up
- While they are a child, no one touches their private parts except parents or a doctor when a parent is present
- They are not to touch anyone else's private parts with any part of their body (hand, mouth, etc.)

### 4. Establish Clear Reporting Rules

Teach your child that if someone asks to see or touch their private parts, or shows the child their private parts, they must tell you or another trusted adult immediately. This rule applies no matter who the person is - including relatives, babysitters, or other children.

**Example script for explaining boundaries progressively:**
"Sometimes mom or dad helps you wipe when you poop, but no one else needs to touch you there. And you can wipe yourself when you pee, so no one, not even mom or dad, needs to touch you there. And now that you're three, you can wash yourself in the bath, so no one needs to wash you there, either. So if anyone - anyone at all - asks to see or touch your private parts, you must tell me about it."

This script works because it:
- Acknowledges current caregiving realities
- Shows how autonomy increases with capability
- Establishes absolute reporting requirements
- Emphasizes the "anyone at all" scope

## Mental Rehearsal and Role-Play

### 5. Use Questions for Mental Rehearsal

Ask your child questions that help them mentally rehearse possible scenarios:

- "What would you do if someone touched you on your _______?"
- "Why is it important to tell?"
- "Who would you tell?"
- "What would you do if the person said it was 'our secret'?"
- "What if they made a threat, like they would hurt you or me?"

Encourage the child to say they would be brave and tell a parent or teacher right away, because it's their body. The purpose is not to frighten but to create mental scripts the child can access if needed.

### 6. Play "What If" Games

Experts recommend playing "what if" games because they allow children to rehearse not only their words but their behavior. The parent's presence and the make-believe nature of the scenario gives children courage to practice resisting an advance. This **programs the subconscious with a script** to use if such an encounter ever happens. Without rehearsal, children may freeze; with it, they have practiced responses ready.

## The No-Secrets Rule

### 7. Establish and Enforce "No Secrets"

Implement a family rule: no secrets. If someone - even a grandparent - says something like "I'll get you an ice cream later, but it will be our secret," firmly but politely respond: "We don't do secrets in our family."

Then turn to your child and reinforce: "Sometimes we have surprises, but never secrets. We tell each other everything."

**The distinction between secrets and surprises:**
- Surprises are temporary and eventually shared (birthday presents, party planning)
- Secrets are meant to stay hidden forever

This rule matters because predators use secrecy as a control mechanism. By establishing that secrets are not allowed in your family, you remove one of the predator's primary tools and give your child explicit permission to tell.

## Consent and Body Autonomy

### 8. Establish Body-Safety House Rules

Create clear household rules around consent:
- "We ask people before we touch their body"
- "When someone says STOP!, we stop"

These rules teach children that their bodies belong to them and that consent is required for physical contact. When children grow up with these norms, they recognize violations more readily.

### 9. Maintain Open Communication

Encourage your children to tell you about things that happen to them that make them feel scared, sad, or uncomfortable. When they share, respond by:
- Listening
- Reflecting their feelings
- Commiserating
- Hugging

If children have an open line of communication, they will be more inclined to alert you to something inappropriate early on. Children who fear judgment or dismissal stay silent.

### 10. Explicitly Remove Blame and Fear

When predators groom children, they tell the child that the parent will punish them or stop loving them if the parent learns about the sexual activity. The child will do anything to keep you from knowing because **suffering the abuse seems better than losing your love**.

Counter this by explicitly discussing with your child that you would never be angry or hold them responsible if someone touches them inappropriately.

**Using books to deepen this discussion:**
When reading body safety books, explore the story from both child and parent perspectives:
- Ask how a child who has been inappropriately touched might feel
- Discuss whether they want to tell their parent and what fears they might have
- Explore how the parent in the story reacts
- Clarify whose responsibility it is (always the adult's, never the child's)
- Emphasize that the parent would never blame the child

Have this discussion multiple times so the message truly sinks in.

### 11. Never Force Physical Affection

Never force children to hug anyone, including relatives. Children need to know they are in charge of their own bodies and they decide how someone touches them.

**Practical alternative when greeting relatives:**
When your child sees someone they haven't seen in a while, ask: "Hug, hearty handshake, or high-five?" Let your child decide.

**What if relatives are offended?**
Adults can handle it. Speak with them privately later about your approach.

The reasoning behind this rule is profound: Children raised to comply with requested affection learn that their discomfort should be overridden to please adults. When sexual abuse happens, those ingrained compliance behaviors paralyze them instead of helping them resist. By letting children refuse unwanted affection, you teach them that their comfort matters more than others' feelings - a crucial skill for recognizing and resisting abuse.

## Supervision and Trust

### 12. Be Selective About Caregivers

Don't leave your child with anyone - including your boyfriend - unless you completely trust them.

**Key statistics on perpetrators:**
- Most abuse is not perpetrated by strangers
- It happens at the hands of family members or the mother's boyfriend
- Almost all remaining cases involve trusted intimates: coaches, religious leaders, teachers

**Why this is "good news":**
Because the risk comes primarily from known individuals rather than random strangers, parents can mitigate risk by:
- Trusting their instincts about people in their child's life
- Paying close attention to their child's behavior and mood
- Being selective about who has unsupervised access

**Specific guidance for stepparents:**
Stepparents should never have responsibility for disciplining their partner's children. This boundary protects children and prevents the power dynamic that can enable abuse.

### 13. Teach Children to Trust Their Feelings

If something doesn't feel right, the child should get away as soon as possible and tell you about it.

**Critical messaging:**
- It is more important to stay safe and trust herself than to be polite
- It is okay to question adults
- It is okay to disobey
- It is okay to run away from someone whose behavior is making her uncomfortable

**The reason this matters:**
Predators give signals before they act. Children naturally pick up on these signals but are often trained to dismiss their discomfort in favor of politeness or obedience. Your explicit permission to trust her own feelings and act on them gives your child the support needed to recognize danger signals and respond.
