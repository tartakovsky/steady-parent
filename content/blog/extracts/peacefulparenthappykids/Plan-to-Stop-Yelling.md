## The Core Problem with Yelling

When parents are angry at their children, most burst out with words they would never say if calm. This happens because the parent enters **"fight or flight" mode**, and in that state, the child looks like the enemy. The parent feels completely justified in the moment.

The aftermath follows a predictable pattern: Later, parents often feel remorse. They apologize or try to reconnect. But if yelling continues as a pattern, children react by "putting another brick in the wall" between parent and child. Dismantling that emotional wall is not easy.

Some parents justify their yelling with rationalizations like "There's just no other way to get through to that kid." This rationalization actually reinforces the wall between parent and child rather than addressing the real problem.

**The promise**: It is completely possible to stop yelling, regardless of how much you currently yell or how your child acts. This is described as "the hardest work there is" and takes time, but the results are priceless.

## Why Stopping Yelling Works Better Than Continuing

Two key benefits emerge when parents stop yelling:

1. **Improved relationship leads to better behavior**: Parent and child become much closer, which means the child will actually want to behave better. The connection itself becomes the motivation for cooperation.

2. **Modeling teaches regulation**: Watching the parent manage their emotions helps the child learn to regulate their own emotions. Children learn emotional regulation primarily from observing their parents stay calm and compassionate during difficult moments.

**Critical insight**: Children are more cooperative when parents are more regulated. This means yelling is not actually effective at achieving compliance, even though it feels powerful in the moment.

## Why Self-Blame Doesn't Help

Blaming and criticizing yourself does not help you do better. The actual key is **giving yourself more support** so you are less likely to lose control in the first place. The plan focuses on prevention and support rather than willpower and self-criticism.

## The 10-Point Plan

### 1. Take a Vow of "Yellibacy"

**The technique**: Create a sticker chart labeled "Respectful Voice" and put it on the refrigerator. The child decides whether the parent earns a star each day. Yelling disqualifies a star.

**Important clarification**: You can still guide and direct your child, just do it respectfully. The goal is not permissiveness but respectful communication.

**Why use sticker charts for parents when they're not recommended for kids?** Sticker charts can teach children the wrong lessons about motivation, but for adults embarking on a difficult behavioral change, the concern is different. The parent is taking on a tough mission and needs an accountability partner. The child serves as that accountability partner, which adds an additional layer of commitment.

### 2. Make Sure You Aren't Running on Empty

**The core principle**: You cannot act much nicer than you feel. If you are running on empty, you cannot regulate your emotions. If you cannot regulate your emotions, you cannot be emotionally generous to your child.

**The solution**: Find sustainable ways to maintain your sense of well-being. This keeps you ready to rise to the occasion when your child pushes your buttons.

**Additional framing**: Parents deserve to feel sunny too. Parenting is described as a marathon, not a sprint. Sustainable self-care is essential, not selfish.

### 3. Set Limits Before Things Get Out of Control

**The timing insight**: Set limits while you can still be empathic and keep your sense of humor. By the time you are losing it, not yelling becomes nearly impossible, requiring you to "bite your tongue so hard you give yourself a piercing."

**Reframing responsibility**: Since you are only human and will yell once pushed to the edge, it becomes your responsibility to stay away from the edge. The intervention point is early, not at the moment of explosion.

### 4. Remember That Children Will Act Like Children

**Normalizing child behavior**: Acting out is children's job. They need to test limits to know where limits are. They need to "act out" feelings they cannot express in words to let parents know they need help with tangled-up emotions.

**The parent's job**: Set limits with empathy and kindness, then stay connected while children express their upsets. This approach helps children want to follow the parent's lead and internalize limits, rather than merely comply under threat.

**The payoff**: This approach helps children develop genuine self-discipline (not just compliance). It also helps them cooperate more overall, which makes it easier for the parent not to yell. The approach creates a positive feedback loop.

### 5. Stop Yelling and Start Connecting

**Challenging the assumption**: Parents yell because they want to change their child's behavior. However, yelling is not actually the best way to change behavior long-term.

**The alternative**: Try empathy. You can still set limits as necessary, but take time to see things from your child's point of view. Empathize with them and help them meet whatever need they were trying to meet, but in a better way.

**Two common underlying needs with examples**:

**Mastery need**: When a child is screaming because they wanted to do something themselves, the empathic response addresses the real need: "You're screaming because you wanted to do it yourself? Here, let's pull over the chair for you to climb up, and you can do it yourself."

**Connection need**: When a child uses a whiny voice (often at tired times of day), the underlying need may be connection: "I hear that whiny voice... this is a tired time of day, isn't it? Come, let's put you in the carrier so you can watch over my shoulder while I make dinner, and we'll stay very close."

**The mechanism**: Addressing the need or emotion behind the behavior changes the behavior, without raising your voice.

**Bonus benefit**: Parenting with more connection puts the joy back in parenting for the parent, not just the child.

### 6. Teach Emotional Regulation

**How children learn regulation**: Kids learn emotional regulation from their parents staying calm and compassionate in the face of the child's upsets.

**Effective response example**: When a toddler is hitting, saying "You are so mad! Tell me in words! No hitting!" teaches the child several things simultaneously:
- Being angry is acceptable
- There is a word for this feeling (anger)
- The parent understands how the child feels
- This understanding helps the child control the impulse to hit

**Ineffective response and why it fails**: Telling the child they are "a bad boy" may cause the child to try to squelch their anger. However, squelching only works temporarily. The anger will burst out uncontrolled at another time. Suppression does not teach regulation; it creates pressure that eventually explodes.

### 7. Play Instead

**The mechanism**: Kids respond to the "tone" of parental energy. When parents have an edge in their voice, children feel anxious and move into their own "fight or flight." This causes them to raise their own voices, argue, or melt down.

**The alternative**: Responding to minor infractions with humor and playfulness causes children to relax and cooperate.

**Concrete example**: Instead of "I told you to go take your bath right now!" try "I am the robot of the bath... I have come to carry you off to the bathroom!" using a mechanical voice and lumbering gait. This gets the child squealing with laughter and running ahead toward the bath.

**Why this works**: Playfulness shifts the child out of defensive mode and into cooperative mode by changing the emotional tone of the interaction.

### 8. Notice What Triggers You

**The insight about yelling**: When we yell, it is because we are triggered. At the time, we think we are right. But since yelling is never the most effective way to handle conflict, we would not yell if we were not triggered. The feeling of righteous justification is itself a sign of being triggered.

**The healing process**: The best way to start healing triggers is to reflect on your own childhood with someone you trust. Journaling and workbooks can also help.

**Key reflection questions**:
- How did your parents handle it when you got angry or upset?
- Did you get yelled at?
- How did it make you feel?

**What to do with these reflections**: Surface those feelings, breathe through them, and let them go. This process deactivates triggers by processing the old emotions attached to them.

### 9. Use Your Pause Button When Losing It

**What to do when you catch yourself yelling or losing your temper**:
1. **Stop** - even if you are in the middle of a sentence
2. **Drop** - your agenda, just for now
3. **Breathe**
4. Shut your mouth as soon as you notice your voice is raised
5. Walk away

**Reframing the concern about "losing face"**: Walking away is not losing face. It is modeling responsible anger management. The parent demonstrates that it is acceptable and wise to remove yourself from a situation when emotions are too high.

### 10. Teach Only Love

**The critical mistake**: Do not try to teach your child "a lesson" when you are angry. In that state, you will be modeling lessons you do not want to teach. The lesson taught is not the intended content but the behavior demonstrated.

**What to do instead**: Take a breath and say a mantra. Example mantra: "Kids need love most when they deserve it least."

**The timing rule**: Wait until you are calm. Interventions are much more effective when delivered from a regulated state.

## Implementation Guidance

**Suggested trial period**: Try the approach for one week.

**Support structures recommended**:
- Get enough sleep
- Get support from other parents
- Read a good parenting book
- Consider taking an online parenting course

**Rationale for support**: What you are doing is hard, and you deserve the support to be successful. This is not about willpower but about setting up conditions for success.

**Predicted outcome**: You will see a wonderful change in your family, one that will keep you going long after the initial experiment ends. Within a year, you may not remember the last time you yelled.

## Key Quote on Authenticity

From Naomi Aldort:

"If you're upset, it is the wrong thing to say or do and will only aggravate the situation. It is not what you want to say. It does not represent your true intention and is therefore inauthentic. The proof to this inauthenticity is that later you regret your words and actions and they build walls between you and your child."

This quote captures a key philosophical foundation: Words spoken in anger are not authentic expressions of your true self or intentions. The regret that follows is evidence of this inauthenticity. The wall-building effect of repeated inauthentic angry outbursts compounds over time.

## Summary of Core Mechanisms

1. **Yelling puts children in fight-or-flight** -> they cannot cooperate from that state
2. **Connection creates desire to cooperate** -> relationship quality drives behavior more than threats
3. **Modeling teaches more than words** -> children learn regulation by watching regulated parents
4. **Addressing underlying needs resolves surface behaviors** -> behavior is often communication of unmet needs
5. **Triggers come from the parent's history** -> healing personal triggers reduces reactivity
6. **Self-care prevents depletion** -> regulated parents can stay regulated under pressure
7. **Early intervention prevents escalation** -> setting limits calmly before losing control is easier than regaining control after losing it
8. **Play shifts the emotional tone** -> humor and playfulness move children out of defensive mode
