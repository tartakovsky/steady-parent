# Handling Aggressive Behaviors Children Learn from Peers at School

## Core Principle: Connection as the Foundation

**Connection** is the secret to a cooperative, happy parent-child relationship. A deeply connected child is always more cooperative. The parent's role is to remain the child's **North Star**, serving as the arbiter of right and wrong until the child is comfortable doing this independently. When children bring home behaviors that bother parents, they are essentially asking for guidance.

## Understanding the Developmental Transition

When a child moves from toddler to preschooler (around age 3), they experience new-found independence and begin learning from sources outside the home. This transition often coincides with major changes like weaning or starting school. Parents are challenged to find new ways to calm and connect with their children when previous bonding tools (like breastfeeding) are no longer available.

## The Special Time Practice

**Special time** is recommended as a daily practice, ideally 10 minutes minimum. This is the best way to stay connected with a child, and connected children are more cooperative.

**What special time IS:**
- One-on-one time without anything else going on
- Snuggling, listening, and connecting
- Unstructured, child-led

**What special time is NOT:**
- Reading to the child (too structured)
- Any structured activity

**What happens during special time:**
- The child may tell you about what happened at school
- The child may ask to pretend-play certain scenarios (e.g., "You be Rachel at school and I will push you")
- The child may have a melt-down to release pent-up emotions

All of these responses are the child working through issues that are bothering them.

## Why Children Mimic Aggressive Behaviors

Children often mimic behavior they observe in the world, even when that behavior runs counter to what they have seen at home. There are two distinct reasons this happens:

### Reason 1: Experimentation

Sometimes children are simply copying what they have seen others do, experimenting to see what the parent thinks of the behavior. They are testing: Is it allowed? Does it work? The parent's response teaches them whether such behaviors are useful in getting their needs met.

### Reason 2: Processing Trauma

Children who are yelled at, humiliated, hit, or pushed by peers will often begin to exhibit these behaviors at home, acting as the aggressor. This happens because when we're traumatized, we learn both sides of that relationship. We try to overcome the terrible feeling of powerlessness by asserting power over someone else, just as was done to us.

**Key diagnostic signal:** If simply setting a limit does not stop the behavior, this may indicate the child is working through a trauma by "repeating" it.

## What NOT to Do: The Threatening Approach

**Anti-pattern:** Saying things like "Where did you learn this from?" or "If you learn such things then I won't let you play with these friends."

**Why this fails:** Simply shutting down the behavior and threatening not to let the child play with certain children won't help the child process and integrate their experience. The underlying feelings remain unaddressed and will continue to drive the behavior.

## Initial Limit-Setting (For Experimentation Cases)

When the behavior appears to be simple experimentation, set the limit kindly and firmly:

- "Ouch! Pushing hurts. We don't push in this house."
- "Ouch! Hitting hurts! I would never hit you. Please don't hit me. Use your words to tell me you're mad."

These responses accomplish multiple things: they name the behavior, state its impact, set the family norm, model appropriate behavior, and redirect toward words.

## The Ten-Step Process for Trauma Processing

When limit-setting alone doesn't work, the child likely needs help processing feelings that are motivating the hitting and pushing. This ten-step process is really about empathizing so the child can access their own feelings and express them safely. Once they've done that, the feelings won't control them anymore.

### Step 1: Say What You See (Naming the Behavior)

Simply observe and name: "You are pushing. You are hitting."

This is neutral observation without judgment, creating space for exploration.

### Step 2: Empathize with the Need or Feeling Behind the Actions

"You're so mad at me."

The goal is to connect the visible behavior to an internal state, helping the child feel understood.

### Step 3: Listen and Empathize (Encouraging Verbal Expression)

"Can you tell me why you're mad? Oh, I said it was nap time? You're showing me NO NAP!"

This step invites the child to verbalize their experience and confirms understanding through active listening.

### Step 4: Help Her Reflect on Her Experience

"I wonder if someone has pushed you? I wonder if someone has hit you?"

**Key technique:** Use wondering language rather than direct questions. This opens the door for the child to connect their current behavior to past experiences without feeling interrogated.

### Step 5: Listen to Her Response and Empathize More

"Sometimes Rachel hits and pushes you? That makes you mad!"

Continue validating as the child reveals more of their experience. Name both the facts and the feelings.

### Step 6: Let Her Express and Vent

"You are crying and pushing. You are showing me how mad you are."

**Important:** The child may continue the aggressive behavior while processing. The parent continues to name what they see, treating the behavior as communication rather than something to immediately stop.

### Step 7: Go Under the Anger to the Vulnerable Feelings

"Ouch! It hurts when she pushes and hits. It hurts your body and your feelings. You are crying and crying."

**Core concept:** Anger defends against more vulnerable feelings. The parent helps the child access what lies beneath the anger, which is often hurt, fear, or sadness. This is where the real emotional processing happens.

### Step 8: Help Her Reconnect as the Storm Passes

"I'm right here to hold you, Sweetie. It's ok to cry. I love you no matter what."

The parent offers physical comfort and unconditional love as the emotional intensity subsides. The child needs to know the relationship remains secure despite the emotional storm.

### Step 9: After Everyone Is Calm, Express Honestly How Her Behavior Makes You Feel

Use **"I Statements"** and go under YOUR anger to the more vulnerable feelings your anger is defending against: "When you push or hit, it scares me. We don't push or hit people we love. I don't want you to push or hit me."

**Key insight:** The parent models the same emotional honesty they helped the child develop. Rather than expressing anger, the parent names the vulnerable feeling (fear) underneath. This teaches the child that adults also have feelings and models appropriate emotional expression.

**Timing matters:** This happens AFTER everyone is calm, not during the emotional storm.

### Step 10: Give Your Daughter Tools for the Next Encounter

"Pushing and hitting hurt. I would never push or hit you. I don't want anyone to push or hit you. What can you say to Rachel when she pushes or hits you?"

**Structure of this message:**
1. Restate the family value (pushing and hitting hurt)
2. Model the behavior (I would never push or hit you)
3. Express the wish for the child's safety (I don't want anyone to push or hit you)
4. Invite problem-solving (What can you say to Rachel?)

The child is now ready to think forward and develop strategies because the emotional charge has been processed.

## The Underlying Logic of the Ten Steps

The progression follows a specific emotional arc:

1. **Steps 1-3:** Establish connection and create safety for emotional expression
2. **Steps 4-6:** Help the child access and express the experience and emotions
3. **Step 7:** Go deeper to the vulnerable core beneath the protective anger
4. **Step 8:** Reconnect and restore security
5. **Steps 9-10:** Teach and empower once the child is regulated

The reason this works is that once a child has fully expressed their feelings in a safe context, those feelings no longer control them. They become available to hear limits, understand their impact on others, and develop new strategies.

## Summary of Key Concepts

- **Connection before correction:** A connected child is cooperative; maintain special time daily
- **Behavior as communication:** When children bring home aggressive behaviors, they're asking for guidance
- **Two paths diverge:** Simple experimentation needs limit-setting; trauma processing needs the full ten steps
- **Anger is a cover:** Underneath anger are more vulnerable feelings like hurt and fear
- **Model what you teach:** Express your own vulnerable feelings using I-statements
- **Process before problem-solve:** Emotional expression must complete before teaching new tools
