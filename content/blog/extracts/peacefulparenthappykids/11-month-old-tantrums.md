# Understanding and Responding to 11-Month-Old Tantrums

## The Developmental Context: Why Tantrums Emerge Around Age One

**Self-assertion as a developmental milestone**: Around 11-12 months, babies begin asserting themselves as separate persons with their own wants and needs. This is actually a positive development, not a problem to be fixed. The behavior represents the beginning of the child developing their own **agency** - the ability to express what they want and try to get it.

**Why babies become less distractible**: As babies develop, they become clearer about their own needs and try to assert control over their environment to meet those needs, just as adults do. Before speech develops, physical resistance is their primary communication tool for situations they don't like.

**The neurological limitation**: The second year is the hardest stage of self-assertion because toddlers don't yet have the neurological development to reason or control their emotions. This capacity begins developing around age three or four. Until then, they literally cannot regulate themselves the way older children can.

**What tantrums actually represent**: The child is not "throwing fits" to manipulate or get attention. The child throws fits because they are 11 months old, feel passionately about everything, and simply don't have the capacity for self-control yet. Tantrums are an expression of **powerlessness** - the overwhelming feeling of wanting something intensely and being unable to either get it or manage the emotions around not getting it.

## The Core Parenting Philosophy

### Why Meeting Expressed Wishes Matters

When babies express wishes and parents meet them, the child learns they can have an impact on the world. This is how **optimism, competence, and confidence develop**. More importantly, when the child sees that the parent cares about satisfying their wishes, that's how they know they are loved.

**The relationship analogy**: If a spouse said they loved you but always told you no about what you wanted, would you feel loved? The same principle applies to children.

### When You Can't Meet Their Wishes

When you cannot meet a child's wishes for safety or other important reasons, the child at least needs to feel:
1. That you have heard them
2. That you have a good reason for not helping them get what they need
3. That you are still on their side and care about their needs and wants

**How you navigate disagreements determines the relationship**: The way parents handle these moments of conflict determines how close they will ultimately be with their child. It also determines whether the child becomes **contrary** - developing a need to resist parental authority in a knee-jerk fashion because an ongoing power struggle is the only way they can assert their personhood.

## The Comforting Approach vs. Ignoring Tantrums

### Why Ignoring Tantrums Is Harmful

Many experts advocate ignoring tantrums, but this advice is **outdated and counterproductive**.

**The relationship test**: How would you feel about your spouse if they ignored you when you were upset? Ignoring signals that the child's feelings aren't allowed, which teaches them to stuff their emotions. This creates **explosiveness in early childhood** and **emotional repression in adulthood**.

### What Actually Reduces Tantrums

**Three responses and their outcomes**:
1. When we ignore tantrums -> kids tantrum more
2. When we "give in" by giving the child what they're tantrumming for -> they tantrum more
3. When we respond to unhappiness by offering comfort and understanding -> they tantrum less

Comforting the child will NOT make tantrumming worse. The fear that responding will reinforce the behavior is unfounded.

### Why Some Tantrums Should Still Be Avoided

While responding with comfort is ideal, it's best to prevent tantrums when possible because tantrums are **scary to the child**. The goal isn't to have more opportunities to comfort during tantrums - it's to help the child feel less overwhelmed in the first place.

## Prevention Strategies: Taming Tantrums Before They Start

### 1. Sidestep Power Struggles

Let the child save face. You don't have to prove you're right. The child is trying to assert that they are a real person with real power in the world - this is totally appropriate.

**The autonomy principle**: The more control little ones have over their own lives, the less they need to be defiant. Letting them make as many choices as possible (food, clothes, toys, etc.) reduces tantrums because they don't feel as powerless.

Let the child say no whenever you can do so without compromising:
- Safety
- Health
- Other people's rights

### 2. Preempt Hunger and Tiredness

Most tantrums happen when kids are hungry or tired. Babies who are tired and hungry don't have the inner resources to handle frustration.

**Preventive tactics**:
- Preemptive feeding and napping
- Firm bedtimes
- Enforced rests
- Cozy times
- Peaceful quiet time without media stimulation

**The "just say no to yourself" rule**: Don't squeeze in that last errand. Don't drag a hungry or tired child to the store. Make do or do it tomorrow.

### 3. Say YES to Feelings, NO to Demands

The child is allowed to want what they want and have big feelings about hearing No. The approach:
- Acknowledge their wishes
- Don't give in against your better judgment
- Be kind about it
- Stay connected while saying No

**The early teaching opportunity**: Begin reminding the child when a tantrum is brewing that if they have a tantrum, you aren't allowed to even consider their request. This won't necessarily work until they're older, but it usually helps toddlers pull it together enough for you to address the underlying situation.

### 4. Ensure Adequate "Cozy Time"

If you ever think your child is tantrumming "just for attention," then they must really need your attention, and the only possible response is to give it to them. Kids who feel needy are more likely to tantrum.

**The reconnection principle**: If you've been separated all day, make sure you reconnect before you try to do other things (like shopping for dinner).

## Handling Tantrums When They Occur

### Maintaining Connection During the Tantrum

If the child launches into a tantrum despite preventive efforts:
- Do NOT sever the connection
- Stay nearby, even if they won't let you touch them
- They need to know you're there and still love them
- Be calm and reassuring
- Don't try to reason with them

**What to say**: Simply acknowledge feelings - this can shorten the tantrum dramatically. Example: "You are so mad. You are showing me how much you wanted that candy."

**What NOT to do during the tantrum**: Don't try to explain why they can't have the thing, and don't give them the thing. Just acknowledge and empathize with the feelings.

### Handling Physical Aggression

If the child tries to hit you:
- Either move away, OR
- Hold them without hurting them so they can't hit you

**What to say**: "You are so mad at me. You feel really sad that you can't have that."

### The Emotional Arc of a Tantrum

Eventually, the child will get past the anger to the sad feelings underneath and just cry in your arms. It isn't bad for them to cry - little people have many frustrations and sometimes, like adults, they just need to cry.

**Why "over-reacting" is okay**: Yes, they're over-reacting. But it's good for them to get all their "sads and mads" out in the safety of your embracing presence. Breathe your way through it.

**The aftermath**: After the tantrum, they'll either sleep or feel so good you'll have a wonderful evening together.

### The Parent's Emotional Framework

**The empathy exercise**: Think about what you feel like when you're swept with exhaustion, rage, and hopelessness. If you lose it, you want someone else there:
- Holding things together
- Reassuring you
- Acknowledging your feelings
- Helping you get yourself under control

The child needs to know that you love them no matter what feelings they have, and that as soon as they're ready, you'll help them recollect themselves.

### After the Tantrum

Make up. Take some cozy time together so the child is reassured that you still love them.

## Parenting Aikido: The Creative Approach

**The concept**: Work with the child's need for independence while still meeting your need as the parent to keep things safe. This requires creativity.

**The choice technique**: Give the child power to choose between two options that are both acceptable to you.

**Example script**: "We have to get in the car now. Do you want to climb in yourself?" (you may have to assist) "Or do you want me to put you in?"

**The empathy-plus-alternative technique**: When you can't do what they want, offer empathy along with an acceptable substitute.

**Example script**: "You wish you could have a cookie. But the rule is no cookies before dinner. Come be with mom and snuggle and let's have some milk."

The child may still tantrum, but they'll eventually learn that they can't always have what they want, but they can have something better: a parent who takes their desires seriously and understands when they're unhappy.

## Key Reassurances for Parents

- This behavior is not unusual for babies around a year old
- This is a healthy, developmentally appropriate stage
- It usually comes as a shock - the sweet, compliant baby seems to have disappeared
- The child developing their own voice as a person in their own right will continue throughout childhood
- Parents will need to guide and set appropriate limits, but should also expect the child to have their own ideas
- This too shall pass
