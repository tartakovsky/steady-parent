# Choose Love: A Framework for Parental Emotional Regulation

## Core Principle: The Choose Love Mantra

**"Choose Love"** is a parenting mantra that serves as a decision-making anchor in difficult moments. The fundamental insight is that in any situation where fear is tightening its grip or anger is building toward an explosion, you have the power to defuse the situation. You may not know what to do or say. You may be scared or angry. But you always have the choice to turn away from fear or anger, to open the door and let love in.

When this choice is successfully made, it transforms situations so completely that it can feel miraculous. The author acknowledges they can't always pull this off, but when they can, it always works.

## What Choose Love Does NOT Mean

**It does not mean abandoning limits.** You still set boundaries: "No throwing sand... Out of the sandbox."

**It does not mean "swallowing your kid's crap."** This is a common misconception. When parents begin consciously choosing love, they often wonder if they're being doormats. But the crap being processed isn't actually the child's - it's the parent's own old emotional baggage that's causing them to overreact.

## What Choose Love DOES Mean

**Being supportive rather than punitive.** Instead of punishment, you acknowledge feelings while maintaining limits: "You wish you could play in the sandbox. It was too hard for you to stop throwing sand. We'll try again tomorrow."

**Resisting indulging your own temper, even when angry.** This is the hard part. You notice the anger, swallow hard, and refrain from taking your anger out on your child.

**Pulling the camera back to see both perspectives.** In addition to your own viewpoint, you see your child's perspective. This shift in vantage point is essential.

**Getting curious and compassionate when you don't understand the behavior.** Maybe they're falling apart or lashing out because they're tired, hungry, or jealous of their brother. Maybe they need you to put your phone down and connect with them. Or maybe you don't know why they're acting obnoxious - so you take a deep breath and get curious rather than reactive.

## The Triggering Mechanism: Why Parents Overreact

### How Triggers Work

**The definition of getting triggered:** Your nervous system interprets something as a threat and plunges you into "fight or flight." In fight mode, your child looks like the enemy.

**The key diagnostic:** If you're overreacting, you're triggered. The overreaction itself is proof that old baggage is involved. If you weren't triggered, you would respond to your child's inappropriate behavior by calmly setting limits - even while acknowledging your child's perspective - which would help your child WANT to cooperate.

**Your child did not install that trigger.** It's been inside you for a long time. Our children, with their unerring instinct for pushing our buttons, give us the opportunity to notice and heal our old emotional baggage.

### Why This Matters

Until we deal with our own suffering, we inevitably take it out on others. This is described as **the root of all violence in the world, including emotional violence.**

If we "lose it" with our kids, we heighten the drama and make everything worse. By definition, that is not in our best interest or their best interest.

## The Modeling Imperative

**Children gain control to regulate their emotions, and therefore their behavior, only when their parents demonstrate emotional regulation.** This is presented as fact, not theory.

If you want your children to express their anger appropriately, you need to model that. We are the role models even - especially - when our children provoke us.

**The developmental context:** Children will often act thoughtlessly on their emotions even when it's not in their best interests because they don't have a fully developed prefrontal cortex. This is sometimes called being "childish." Adults only stoop to that level when triggered.

## The Stop, Drop, Breathe Protocol

When you notice your anger mounting, take a breath and step away from your child. Then:

### 1. Stop
Resist acting. You're in fight or flight, so you'll feel like it's an emergency and you must take immediate action. The directive is simple: Just resist speaking or moving.

### 2. Drop
Drop your agenda, just for the moment, until you're calmer. While you're angry is not the time to make decisions.

**Critical warning:** Don't let your mind get sucked into a storyline about why you're right, or how your own parent would have handled this situation. Instead, just focus on the sensations those big emotions are causing in your body.

### 3. Breathe
Breathe into the physical discomfort. Love yourself through it.

**The hard truth:** Sitting with our own pain is the hardest thing in the world. But when we hold ourselves with loving compassion and allow ourselves to just notice the sensations in our body that signal an emotion - without acting on the emotions, without attaching a story - the emotions begin to fade away.

**The mechanism:** Little by little, that old baggage begins to loosen its hold on us and to disappear.

**The result:** You've stopped yourself from being hijacked. You've calmed your nervous system. Now you have access again to the thinking part of the brain, and to your compassion.

## After Calming: Choosing Love in Action

**See the situation from your child's perspective, with emotional generosity.** Your child's actions may be unacceptable, but their feelings are always valid.

## The Difficulty of the Choice

When we're stuck in big emotions, they take on a life of their own. We feel righteously entitled to them. In that moment, we don't realize that we're overreacting.

It takes courage to make the choice to turn away from those emotions, to turn toward love.

**The "getting away with it" worry:** Sometimes we worry that our child is "getting away with something." But all she's getting away with is showing us her own tangled emotions, her own pain. By listening and accepting her exactly as she is, we give her a chance to face that pain and work through it - so she doesn't have to carry it with her into adulthood, like so many of us did.

## The Follow-Up Conversation

**Timing:** You talk with your child about behavior AFTER everyone calms down, not in the heated moment.

**Content:** Discuss how their big emotions drove them to act in ways that were hard for others, and how they can notice those challenging emotions and express them more appropriately.

**The modeling sequence:** You start by modeling emotional regulation right in that moment, right in the face of your child's messy emotions. The conversation comes later.

## The Healing Mechanism

**The miraculous result:** When we extend love - when we accept our child's emotions with compassion, without getting angry ourselves, even while limiting behavior - our child's big emotions begin to heal and settle.

**We don't need to swallow crap - we heal it.** The miracle of this mindful approach is that it works just by bringing more consciousness to that old pain. The metaphor offered: Think of it as shining a light, and the shadows melt away.

## The Dual Benefit

**When we refuse to visit our own pain on our child, we aren't only choosing love for our child. We're also choosing love for ourselves.**

This reframes the entire effort: It's not self-sacrifice or "swallowing" anything. It's self-healing that simultaneously benefits the child.
