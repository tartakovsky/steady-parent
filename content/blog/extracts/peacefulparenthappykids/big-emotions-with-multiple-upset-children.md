# Helping Multiple Children with Big Emotions Simultaneously: Extracted Knowledge

## The Core Challenge

Having multiple children creates a unique parenting difficulty: moments when more than one child needs you at once. Parental love may be unlimited, but physical presence and attention are finite resources. This creates situations where the normal approach of giving one child full attention during emotional distress becomes impossible.

The fundamental insight is that while these situations feel like emergencies, they are manageable with specific strategies. The key is maintaining your own emotional regulation while acknowledging each child's needs.

## The Power of Preventive Maintenance

The article emphasizes that the best strategy for handling multiple upset children is preventing the situation through "preventive maintenance." When children receive consistent emotional connection and support proactively, they experience fewer unpredictable meltdowns. This doesn't eliminate the problem entirely, but it significantly reduces how often parents face the scenario of multiple children needing support simultaneously.

## Nine Strategies for Managing Multiple Upset Children

### Strategy 1: Tend to Both Children Simultaneously When Both Need You

When both children genuinely need you at the same moment, the recommended approach is to attend to both rather than choosing one. Picking one child over the other creates a perception of favoritism or taking sides, which compounds the emotional distress.

**The technique:** Position one child on each side of you, keeping them physically separated but both within your embrace. Announce what is happening verbally so both children understand the situation.

**Example language:** "I have two upset children who are both hurting right now! You both need your Papa right now, don't you... Come here, my Sweethearts, there is always plenty of room in my arms... You on my right, and you on my left, both of you in my arms... That's right, you can cry as much as you want... then we will sort this out and make everything better... whatever happens, we always work it out."

**Key principle:** The physical separation (one on each side, out of reach of each other) prevents escalation between the children while allowing both to receive comfort. Continuous breathing helps the parent maintain composure.

### Strategy 2: Communicate with the Child You Cannot Attend to Immediately

When circumstances require attending to one child first (such as physical injury taking precedence over emotional distress), explicitly acknowledge the other child's needs and provide a timeline.

**Example scenario:** One child (Brian) has a physical injury while another (Kaylee) is emotionally upset. The parent scoops up Brian while verbally addressing Kaylee.

**Example language:** "Kaylee, I hear you're hurting and you need me, and I will be right there. I am just helping Brian with his owie, and then I will help you with your feelings."

**Key principle:** The child who must wait needs to know they have been seen, their needs are acknowledged, and help is coming. This prevents them from feeling abandoned or less important.

### Strategy 3: Occupy the Less Needy Child with an Activity

When one child needs more intense attention than the other, connect briefly with the less distressed child to confirm they are okay, then provide an engaging activity.

**The technique:** Give the less upset child a hug, explain the situation, and provide a pre-prepared activity they enjoy, such as an audiobook or sensory activity.

**Example language:** "I have something special for you to do for a few minutes while I help your sister with her feelings."

**For very young children:** Sensory bags can work even for children as young as 16 months. These should be secured with ample duct tape to prevent the child from opening them. The young child can be placed in the next room with the sensory bag, visible to the parent, while attending to the child having the meltdown.

**Key principle:** Having pre-prepared activities (an "Activity Box") ready for these situations makes the strategy executable under pressure.

### Strategy 4: Reassure the Concerned Sibling

When one child becomes worried about a sibling who is crying or upset, acknowledge those feelings of concern and provide reassurance about the outcome.

**Example language:** "Your sister is sad and mad... I'm helping her with her feelings... She'll feel better soon."

**Key principle:** The observing sibling's worry is a legitimate emotional response that deserves acknowledgment, even while the primary focus remains on the child in crisis.

### Strategy 5: Accommodate Children Who Insist on Being Close

If the sibling insists on being present during the other child's meltdown, do not fight this need. Instead, sit on the floor with children on opposite sides, allowing you to acknowledge both while shifting attention as needed.

**Key principle:** Attempting to physically separate children who want to be near each other often creates additional conflict. Managing proximity is more practical than enforcing distance.

### Strategy 6: Acknowledge When the Upset Child Resents the Sibling's Presence

The child having the meltdown will often become angry that their sibling is intruding on their moment of need. This is a legitimate feeling that should be acknowledged.

**Example language:** "You don't want your sister here... You're having a hard enough time without her... Sometimes it's hard to have another person around."

**Then restore safety:** "Your sister is just worried about you... She will stay over here, away from you. I am right here for you."

**Key principle:** Validating the upset child's frustration about the sibling's presence, while also explaining the sibling's motivation (concern, not malice), addresses both children's emotional needs.

### Strategy 7: Maintain Your Sense of Humor

Two crying children naturally feels like an emergency situation. The parent's emotional response to this chaos significantly affects the outcome.

**What to avoid:** Lashing out, which is a natural but counterproductive response to feeling overwhelmed.

**What helps children:** Understanding why they are upset (naming the feeling and the cause) combined with nonverbal communication that they are safe and this is not actually catastrophic.

**Example acknowledgment:** "You're mad and sad... your brother bumped your tower and it fell down."

**The breathing technique:** Deep breaths help the parent shift out of "fight or flight" mode. Internal self-talk ("they'll feel and act better after a good cry") supports the parent's ability to remain calm.

**Key principle:** Children need to feel both understood AND assured that their big feelings are not actually dangerous. Parent calmness communicates that the situation is manageable.

### Strategy 8: Resist the Urge to Teach During Emotional Moments

When anxious, parents often default to problem-solving through assigning blame and providing lessons.

**Example of teaching to avoid:** "If you hadn't done that to your sister, everything would be fine. Next time, listen when I tell you..."

**Why this fails:** When emotions are running high, the learning centers in the brain shut down. Teaching is literally impossible in this state. Additionally, words spoken from parental fear often make things worse rather than better.

**The alternative:** Connect with compassion rather than trying to instruct.

**Example compassionate connection:** "I'm sorry this is so hard, Honey."

**Key principle:** There will be time for teaching later when everyone is calm. During the emotional crisis, the only effective intervention is empathetic connection.

### Strategy 9: It Is Acceptable for Parents to Cry Too

If the parent needs to cry, this is allowed and can even be beneficial.

**What to communicate:** The child should understand that the parent's crying is not their fault and they do not need to fix it. Everyone needs to cry sometimes, and crying leads to feeling better.

**What this models:** Emotions are not emergencies. This is described as "the first step toward healthy self-regulation."

**Important caveat:** If the parent is crying every time the children get upset, this indicates the parent needs support for their own emotional processing. Consistent emotional flooding prevents the parent from being helpful to the children.

## The Long-Term Benefit

When a child observes their parent helping a sibling through an emotional crisis, the child learns empathy and how to support someone in pain. This observational learning has lifelong benefits. Children who witness this modeling often begin imitating the behavior and can eventually help each other through upsets independently, using empathy and understanding.

The article includes a parent testimonial: "I have found when another child is witnessing the process of helping kids with emotions they become aware and able to help. Mine often imitate what they've seen me do and can even help each other through upsets on their own with empathy and understanding."

## Underlying Principles

**Prevention is more effective than intervention:** Preventive maintenance reduces how often these challenging situations occur in the first place.

**Fairness matters:** Children are acutely aware of perceived favoritism. When possible, attend to both children simultaneously rather than choosing one.

**Physical separation enables emotional closeness:** Keeping children on opposite sides of you allows comfort while preventing them from escalating each other.

**Verbal acknowledgment bridges attention gaps:** When you cannot be physically present with a child, verbal acknowledgment that you see their need and will help soon provides meaningful support.

**Preparation makes execution possible:** Having activities pre-prepared (sensory bags, audiobooks, an Activity Box) means these strategies are actually usable in the moment.

**Parent emotional regulation is the foundation:** The parent's ability to stay calm, breathe, and maintain perspective determines whether these strategies are accessible.

**Teaching has a time and place:** Emotional crises are for connection and comfort, not instruction. Learning happens later when brains are regulated.

**Modeling matters:** Children learn how to handle emotions by watching how their parents handle emotions - both their own and their children's.
