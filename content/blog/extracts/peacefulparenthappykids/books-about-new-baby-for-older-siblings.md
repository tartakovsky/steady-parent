# Books About the New Baby for Older Siblings

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids

## Purpose and Timing of These Books

Books can serve as tools to **prepare big siblings** for the arrival of a new baby. The goal is both preparation before birth and ongoing support during the adjustment period after the baby arrives.

## How to Access These Books

Several practical approaches for obtaining sibling preparation books:
- **Library borrowing** - Many of these books will be available at public libraries
- **Used copies online** - Gently used books can be found for low prices
- **Bookstore browsing** - Reading books together at a bookstore without purchasing
- **Purchasing favorites** - Worth buying the ones that resonate most to read repeatedly "when times get tough"

The suggestion to buy favorites rather than just borrow them reflects the reality that sibling adjustment is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. Having key books on hand allows for repeated reading during difficult moments of adjustment.

## Key Theme in Sibling Preparation Books

Many sibling preparation books (especially those recommended later in the source's list) share a common narrative arc: **an ambivalent older sibling who comes to love the new arrival**.

This theme serves as **modeling** for older children. By reading stories where characters experience mixed feelings about a new sibling but eventually develop love and acceptance, children are given:
1. Permission to feel ambivalent themselves
2. A roadmap showing that initial negative or mixed feelings can transform into positive ones
3. Reassurance that complicated emotions are normal and expected

The emphasis on ambivalence as a starting point is notable - rather than books that only show excitement about new babies, these recommendations acknowledge the full emotional range children experience.

## Age Groups This Applies To

The recommendations are relevant for:
- Toddlers
- Children in families expecting newborns/infants
- During pregnancy and birth preparation period

## Related Resources

For preparation **before** baby is born, separate resources exist specifically about pregnancy and birth for children, which would logically come earlier in the preparation process than post-birth sibling adjustment books.
