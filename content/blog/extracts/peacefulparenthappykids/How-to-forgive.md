# Healing Childhood Wounds to Become a Better Parent

## Core Concept: The Rat Poison Metaphor

**Anne Lamott's insight**: "Not forgiving someone is like drinking rat poison and expecting the rats to die." The key realization is that carrying resentment doesn't hurt the person who wronged you - it poisons your own heart, keeps you from feeling loved, and changes how you relate to your children, even unconsciously.

## The Connection Between Your Triggers and Your Childhood

When parents get triggered by their children, they often blame the child. But the critical question is: when were those triggers built into your psyche? The answer is during your own childhood. These are YOUR triggers, not your child's fault.

**Key insight**: Life will keep triggering you until you heal these wounds. This isn't random - it's a pattern that repeats until addressed.

Beyond causing outbursts like yelling and shouting, unhealed triggers create:
- Low-grade irritability
- Smoldering resentments
- Closed hearts that block joy and love that are constantly available

**The liberation principle**: If you want to love unconditionally, you must heal your old wounds first.

## Why Even Good Childhoods Leave Wounds

Most people didn't have perfect childhoods, even with loving parents. Parents were products of their time, and most of us didn't receive the message that we were wholly loved, human imperfections and all.

**The triggering mechanism**: If you still have sore spots from childhood, your children will trigger them simply by being children. This is unavoidable until healing occurs.

## What Forgiveness Actually Means

**Critical reframe**: The secret to healing is NOT about "forgiveness" in the conventional sense. You don't need to:
- Call whoever hurt you
- "Make up" with them
- Speak to them ever again
- Give them access to your heart

This healing process is entirely about YOU, not them.

**Oprah's definition of forgiveness**: "Giving up hope that the past could have been any different."

**The actual secret to healing**: Being willing to accept that what happened did indeed happen, and feeling the pain of what you suffered even when every part of you is screaming NO. The path forward involves crying through it and comforting yourself.

Once you offer yourself this healing, you won't need to hang onto the anger anymore.

## The Three-Step Healing Process

### Step 1: Connect with Your Child Self and Acknowledge the Pain

**Setup**: Find time alone. Sit quietly and fill yourself with love and well-being first.

**Process**:
1. Look at a photo of yourself as a child
2. Summon all your compassion and embrace that little one
3. Ask your young self to tell you about their childhood hurts
4. Keep holding yourself in love as you say and hear your childhood truth

**Example phrases to acknowledge**: "I felt unprotected... unseen... unloved... hurt."

**Why this works**: Once you let yourself feel the pain while in your own loving embrace, you won't need to fend it off with anger anymore. The anger serves as a defense mechanism against pain - by feeling the pain safely, the defense becomes unnecessary.

**Important caveat**: Depending on how raw your wounds are, you might need a loving "witness" with you to do this work safely.

### Step 2: Put Pain in Context of Intergenerational Trauma

**Timing**: Only move to this step after working with Step One enough that your wounds feel less raw. This could take months. Wait until you're feeling strong.

**Important clarification**: This step is NOT saying that whatever happened to them justified their wounding you. It doesn't.

**The reframe**: Your parents (or whoever hurt you) weren't born looking to hurt. They were humans who were hurt themselves. Perhaps they weren't as courageous as you are about taking responsibility, so their pain spilled over onto you.

**Questions to consider**:
- Were their childhoods perfect?
- What wounded him?
- What hardened her heart?

**The nuanced position**: You have a right to be angry. Even if they failed you in unforgivable ways, they were wounded themselves. You don't have to forgive them. But if you can see their woundedness, it becomes easier to move on.

**Key principle**: Moving on is not for their benefit. It's for yours.

### Step 3: Move On

**Critical warning**: This does NOT mean making up with anyone who hurt you or giving them access to your heart again. You don't want people in your life who inflict wounds. Arms length may not be enough - toss them out of your life altogether if needed.

**The instruction**: Don't harden your heart. Instead, let yourself cry and heal. Accept what happened - not because it was okay for even one minute, but because acceptance allows you to grieve, which enables healing and moving on.

**Paul Boese's insight**: "You can't change your past, but you can enlarge your future."

**Sample healing statement**: "What you did was not ok. Every child deserves better. I deserved better. I ask for the grace to move on. Please help us all to heal. Thank you."

**Practical note**: You might have to do this more than once, but you'll likely feel lighter.

**On asking for help**: You don't need to phrase it as asking for help. You might find healing in your own heart. But most people need help from a deeper source of healing, whether internal or external. When we ask for help, we make room for grace.

## Understanding Resistance to Letting Go

If letting go feels too hard, recognize this as a defense against pain. Your anger keeps pain away by walling it up inside your heart. The solution is working through the healing process for those hurts so you can move on.

**Implied dependency**: The sequence suggests you need to work on perfectionism and self-love before tackling childhood wounds.

## Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Blaming children for your triggers** - The triggers are yours, built in childhood
2. **Trying to "forgive" in the traditional sense** - This isn't about making up with anyone
3. **Skipping straight to Step 2 before wounds are less raw** - This can retraumatize
4. **Letting harmful people back into your life** - Healing doesn't require reconciliation
5. **Hardening your heart as protection** - This blocks the healing process
6. **Thinking one healing session is enough** - May need to repeat the process multiple times
