# Using Play to Help a Child Who Has Been Bullied or Bossed

## Core Problem: Accumulated Hurt Creates Passive Self-Protection

When a child experiences repeated bullying or bossiness from another child, the emotional impact goes beyond the immediate incidents. The child accumulates negative feelings - hurt and fear - that create a **protective layer of passivity**. This passivity prevents the child from:
- Engaging in new activities
- Making friends
- Being open to new experiences and people

This is why simply removing the bully (transferring the bossing child to another class, for example) may not solve the problem. The accumulated emotional hurt remains and continues to block the child's natural openness and engagement with life. The child needs help processing and releasing these stored feelings before they can fully recover.

## Why Four-Year-Olds Bully and Boss

**Four-year-olds are developmentally prone to bossiness, exclusion, and bullying** because they are experimenting with power. How adults respond to these behaviors influences whether children continue using these social strategies into later childhood - eventually manifesting as more sophisticated versions in school lunchrooms and online.

**Bossiness often stems from the bossing child's own anxieties.** Children who try to control others are frequently responding to their own fears and insecurities. Understanding this helps frame the behavior as a symptom rather than malice.

## Why Modern Children Lack Social Skills Training

In tribal cultures where humans lived before modern times, younger children learned appropriate social relations from older children, and tribal norms were naturally transmitted across generations. These norms presumably did not include bullying and sidelining because such behaviors would not have been adaptive for tribal survival.

Modern society disrupts this natural learning by:
1. Segregating children by age (so younger children don't learn from older ones)
2. Adopting a "let them work it out for themselves" philosophy
3. Not providing enough guidance at early ages about how to navigate social conflicts

This lack of guidance is identified as **one reason (among many) for the epidemic of bullying** in modern childhood.

## Foundation Elements (What the Parent Is Already Doing Right)

The advice acknowledges several important foundations the parent has already established:

**Connection time with the child** - This is described as "the foundation of his emotional adjustment." Regular quality time with parents creates emotional security.

**Gentle parenting with empathic limits instead of punishment** - This matters particularly because **a timid child will respond to conventional discipline by further "sidelining" himself**. Punishment-based discipline makes timidity worse, not better.

**Playdates with other children** - Essential for helping the child feel comfortable and supported in classroom and playground environments.

**Role-playing around assertiveness** - A positive technique, though not sufficient on its own.

## The Two Ways Children Process Anxiety and Hurt

Children work out the anxieties and hurts that accumulate in daily life through two primary channels:
1. **Play**
2. **Tantrums**

This insight is crucial because it means parents can deliberately create play opportunities that allow the child to process stuck emotions. The goal is not direct discussion or instruction about feelings, but creating the conditions where feelings can be released through the child's natural processing mechanisms.

## The Power Play Framework

### Core Principle: Go for Giggles, Not Tears (Initially)

The therapeutic play should **aim for laughter, not crying**. Giggles vent the same tensions that tears release, but through a more accessible pathway. The play should not recreate the painful reality of what the child experienced - that would go directly for tears and may overwhelm the child. Instead, the play should tap into the themes while keeping things light enough to generate laughter.

**Whatever makes the child giggle, do more of it.** Follow the giggles as a guide to what is therapeutically working.

### Technique 1: Stuffed Animal Power Play

Use two stuffed animals to play out power dynamics:
- Have one push the other around
- The child will be fascinated (because it connects to their experiences)
- Crucially: Have the underdog stand up to the bully
- Ham it up and make it fun
- Keep adjusting toward what generates giggles

This technique works because it lets the child observe power dynamics being played out and resolved in a safe, external way, while still tapping into the emotional themes they're processing.

### Technique 2: Let the Child Win Against You

Play directly with the child and let them:
- Push you around
- Win games
- Win during physical roughhousing or pillow fights
- Tell you what to do

**Important caveat:** This doesn't mean doing this all the time. The child still needs the safety and guidance that comes from parents acting like parents. This power-reversal play happens within a specific contained context.

### Technique 3: The Bumbling Monster Game (Daily Special Time)

**Create a dedicated Special Time every single day** - approximately half an hour. Frame it explicitly:

Tell the child: "It's our Special Time and I want to play a special game with you. How about I get to be a big monster and be in charge? Like this!"

The sequence:
1. Roar just powerfully enough to seem serious
2. Announce "And I will catch you!"
3. Immediately trip as you start chasing (this punctures the fear and converts it to laughter)

**On a daily basis during Special Time:**
- Let the child be the more powerful one
- Let them outsmart and overpower the "terrible monster" (you)
- Swagger, strut, and roar about how you will catch them and show them who's boss
- When chasing, always trip, bumble, and let them outsmart or overpower you and escape

**Verbally acknowledge the child's formidable power:** "You are so strong! You pushed me right over!"

The mechanism here: The parent creates a mildly frightening scenario (monster chase) but immediately undercuts it with their own incompetence, allowing the child to feel powerful and triumphant. This builds the child's felt sense of their own power and agency.

### Technique 4: Play with Exclusion Themes

Exclude yourself from something and complain bitterly about it in a joking way. Use the slightest provocation as an excuse:

"How come YOU get to do that and I don't? You always get to decide who does what!!"

**Key instruction: Ham it up and be as silly as possible.** The silliness is what keeps it in the giggle zone rather than the trauma zone.

Again: **Follow the giggles.** Whatever makes the child giggle is helping them, so do more of that specific thing.

## What Happens When Play Leads to Deeper Feelings

After a period of this power-themed play, the child may either:
- Get angry
- Dissolve in tears

**This is a positive sign** - it means the play has helped them reach the heart of their hurt. The giggles have opened the pathway to the deeper, stuck feelings.

When this happens, **embrace the feelings** so the child can offload them. Use supportive language:
- "It's ok to cry, Sweetie."
- "I am right here."
- "I will keep you safe."
- "You are doing a great job with those big feelings."
- "I am right here."

**These tears serve a specific function:** They will dissolve the child's "fortress of passivity" and free them to engage with life again.

## Recommendations for Teachers and Schools

**Every class of four and five year olds needs a proactive program to teach appropriate social skills**, because children will not receive this guidance elsewhere in modern society.

Teachers should implement an ongoing set of practices in the classroom that encourage inclusion. There are books and whole curriculums available to help launch such campaigns.

Parents should have conversations with teachers about what preventive practices they are using with the children, especially when bullying behavior has been observed.

## Summary of the Therapeutic Pathway

1. Accumulated bullying experiences create stored hurt and fear
2. This creates a "fortress of passivity" that blocks engagement
3. Children process anxiety and hurt through play and tantrums
4. Power-themed play (going for giggles) allows safe processing of these themes
5. Eventually the play may unlock deeper feelings (tears or anger)
6. Embracing these feelings allows the child to fully release them
7. Once released, the child can engage openly with life again

The key insight is that **the passivity itself is a symptom of trapped feelings**, and the solution is creating conditions where those feelings can be safely released - first through laughter, then potentially through tears when the child is ready to access the deeper hurt.
