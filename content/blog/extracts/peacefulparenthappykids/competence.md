# Raising Competent Children: Complete Framework

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids - "12 Tips To Raise a Competent Child"

## Defining Competence

**Competence** is the ability to effectively accomplish goals. A competent person stays on track, notices what's needed in a given situation, and responds accordingly. Competent people act with feeling and even inspiration, but don't let emotions derail them. They overcome internal and external obstacles to stay on task and accomplish goals. This means they're able to read other people and respond appropriately to new situations.

**Competence in children** means being able to handle emotional challenges well enough to tackle age-appropriate tasks at each developmental stage, master them, and emerge with greater confidence. Competent children have the emotional intelligence to manage themselves and get along with others.

**Why competence matters:** Children who see themselves as competent feel capable and powerful. They're more likely to be resourceful, to believe in themselves, to attempt difficult challenges, and to exhibit resilience in the face of setbacks. In adults, competence is a prerequisite for achieving professional and personal success.

**Competence is a mix of several traits:** confidence, resourcefulness, perseverance, mastery, and emotional intelligence.

## Core Principle: Let Children Try Things Themselves

### The Practice

From the earliest age, let children attempt things on their own. This doesn't mean abandoning them - stand by, smiling, ready to be helpful in whatever way actually helps. But keep your mouth shut and your hands to yourself except to give appropriate encouragement, unless you really need to help physically.

### Why This Matters

Parental impatience and anxious hovering unintentionally limit children. When you cluck anxiously about how worried you are as your child climbs a play structure, it may make you feel better and impress other parents with your attentiveness, but it won't help your child.

### The Alternative Approach

Instead of expressing worry, ask if they're keeping themselves safe. Then stand by and spot them. Smile proudly. Say things like: "Look at you way up there! Wow!"

If they fall, you're there to catch them - and that's precisely what allowed them to try it in the first place. The safety net enables the risk-taking.

## Scaffolding: Building Confidence Through Supported Challenges

### What Scaffolding Is

**Scaffolding** is a term from emotional development research. It's the framework you give your child on which they build. You demonstrate one step at a time, use questions to suggest each step, or simply spot them - helping them succeed when trying something new.

### Why Scaffolding Works

Small successes achieved with parental help give children the confidence to try new things independently. Scaffolding also teaches children that help is always available if they need it.

**Critical insight:** You want your kids to know deep in their bones that help is available before they hit adolescence. This belief needs to be established early through repeated experiences of supported success.

## The Problem with Testing Children

### The Pattern to Avoid

When you say "What's this color?" and your toddler answers correctly, you get excited. Then you keep asking about the next color and the next. Sooner or later you get to a color they can't identify. To you, that's just one more color you're teaching. To them, that's a failure. They've disappointed you.

### What You're Actually Teaching

You think you're teaching colors. But you aren't. You're teaching them that they aren't good enough.

### The Better Way to Teach

Do it naturally by using names in everyday life: "Let's get the purple one." Children learn when they discover for themselves, not through lecturing, drilling, and testing.

**Rule: There is never a reason to test your child.**

## Responding to Achievements: Empathy Over Evaluation

### The Problematic Pattern

Calling Grandma in front of your child to report on their latest achievement sets them up to worry that unless they're brilliant and precocious, they're a disappointment. This creates a child who worries that they always need to impress those around them.

### Why Telling Kids They're "Smart" Backfires

Telling children they're smart makes it worse because:
1. They know they aren't always smart
2. They don't know how to get smarter
3. Intelligence isn't something they have control over

When we make a big deal about achievements, children feel evaluated. They often worry so much about performance that they refuse even to try new things.

### Three Better Responses

**Comment on successful actions:** "You kept trying until you got it. I love how you never give up!"

**Empathize with their excitement:** "Wow! You figured out how to do that!"

**Encourage process:** "That's a hard puzzle piece, but I see you trying every space to see where it fits. Sooner or later, you'll find the right spot!"

## Praise Effort, Not Results

### Examples of Effort-Based Praise

- "I see you worked so hard on this."
- "Tell me about your painting."

Notice you're not telling them what a great artist they are.

### Why Evaluative Praise Harms

Evaluative praise either:
1. Makes children freeze up, or
2. Turns them into praise junkies, looking outside themselves for someone to tell them they're good enough

### The Core Principle

Even if the work is objectively great, the point is never the product. You don't want children resting on their laurels at six or sixteen. You don't want them thinking they have to live up to some previous pinnacle of achievement.

**What you want:** For them to keep trying, practicing, improving, and to learn that hard work pays off.

## Encouraging Mistakes

### The Mindset to Cultivate

As Ms. Frizzle of the Magic Schoolbus famously said: "Get messy! Take chances!"

### What Happens When Mistakes Are Treated as Problems

Children who get the message that spilled milk is a problem and there's one right way to do things often end up with less initiative and creativity.

### The Better Response

Just smile, hand them the sponge and say: "We always clean up our own messes. I'll help."

This teaches accountability without shame, and models that mistakes are normal parts of learning.

## When to Step In: Avoiding Failure Traps

### The Dilemma

Should you step in when you see failure ahead, or "let them learn a lesson"? This is always a hard call.

### Why Letting Children Fail Can Backfire

Rescuing children can prevent them from learning important lessons. But children who see their parents stand by and let them fail experience that as not being loved.

**What they learn from parental non-intervention:** Instead of learning they should have practiced the clarinet or read the directions, they learn:
- That they're failures
- That they cannot manage themselves
- That their parents did not care enough to help them

### The Difference Between Rescuing and Supporting

**Harmful rescuing:** Taking over the science fair project and doing half of it the night before it's due. Your child learns that you'll bail them out if they goof off, AND that they're incompetent.

**Helpful supporting:** Observe, intervene early if necessary, and offer structure to help them succeed. Help them each step of the way to organize their ideas and work, BUT resist the impulse to improve on the project yourself.

**The outcome of proper support:** They complete the job hugely proud, having learned something about how to plan and execute a complex project. They learn how to succeed instead of how to fail.

## Teaching Self-Encouragement

### The Research Finding

Children who "talk" themselves through challenges stay calmer and are therefore able to persevere when the going gets tough.

### How to Build This Skill

Model maxims to repeat as mantras:
- "Practice makes perfect!"
- "If you don't succeed, try, try again!"
- "I think I can, I think I can!"

These work remarkably well to manage ourselves in the face of frustration.

### Why This Matters

When your son goofs a piece on the piano and has to start over, or your daughter strikes out with the bases loaded, they need an automatic internal comforting voice to encourage and motivate them - not a harsh, self-disparaging voice.

**Key insight:** The tone they hear from you will become their inner voice.

---

## Modeling Positive Self-Talk

### The Anti-Pattern

Most parents know better than to say "What an idiot!" to their child and can stop themselves. But a surprising number see nothing wrong with berating themselves that way in front of their kids.

### Why Self-Criticism in Front of Children Matters

Whatever you model, your child will learn and emulate. If you talk harshly to yourself, they will learn to talk harshly to themselves.

### The Standard to Apply

Would you let anyone else talk to you that way? If not, don't talk to yourself that way either - especially not in front of your children.

## Managing Frustration: Finding the Right Balance

### The Common Misconception

There's a trend in child-raising philosophy that maintains children learn best with reasonable doses of frustration.

### The Nuanced Truth

It's true that we all learn from overcoming challenges. But we also learn best when we experience success, which motivates us to tackle more difficult challenges.

**Mastery begets mastery. Failure sets up a cycle of lack of confidence, giving up, and more failure.**

### Why Extra Frustration Is Unnecessary

Your child will naturally develop the ability to handle increasing amounts of frustration and anxiety as they attempt more difficult challenges. These frustrations are inherent in growing up and are guaranteed aplenty in life.

**There is no benefit whatsoever to setting your child up for extra frustration or negative experience.** They will see your doing so as evidence of your lack of caring, which they always translate as their lack of value.

### How to Support Through Challenging Moments

When your child faces a daunting challenge - from cleaning up spilled milk to starting a history report - see yourself as their companion. Don't do it for them, but go with them, the same way you would if your three-year-old was afraid of a dark room.

When your child does encounter frustration, your empathy will be a critical factor in their overcoming it.

## Affirming Impact on the World

### The Core Mechanism

Competence and feelings of mastery are about power. They derive from a child's experience of themselves as having an effect on the world.

**Example:** "If I stand on the stool, I can flip this light switch and light up the room!"

### The Practice

Minimize the number of times your child gets the message that their actions don't matter.

### Maintaining Realistic Expectations

All children will experience reasonable limits to their power ("I can't make the rain stop, and neither can Mommy"). But the more your child has opportunities to make a difference in the world, the more they will see themselves as capable.

## Related Traits That Increase Competence

Four additional traits work together with and reinforce competence:

1. **Responsibility** - Taking ownership of actions and outcomes
2. **Good Judgment** - Making wise decisions
3. **Optimism** - Maintaining positive expectations
4. **Persistence** - Continuing despite difficulty

Fostering these traits increases overall competence because they all support the child's ability to tackle challenges and achieve goals.
