# Courage in Children: Building Both Physical and Moral Fortitude

Source: https://www.peacefulparenthappykids.com/read/courage

## The True Definition of Courage

**Courage is not the absence of fear.** In fact, acting without fear in genuinely dangerous situations might qualify as stupidity rather than bravery. True courage involves a three-step process:

1. **Noticing the fear** - acknowledging that you feel afraid
2. **Evaluating the situation** - assessing what exactly the danger is and whether it's real
3. **Taking appropriate action** - acting in accordance with your values despite the fear

This framework helps distinguish between situations where fear is a useful signal (actual danger) versus situations where fear is present but the threat is not real (like putting your head under water or standing up for a friend).

The core insight: **Real courage is noticing the fear and supporting yourself through it, so you can act in accordance with your values.**

A second powerful framing from Ambrose Redmoon: **"Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear."**

## Physical Courage vs. Moral Courage

While parents often worry about their children's physical fears (thunderstorms, merry-go-rounds, the dark), **in our culture, courage is usually moral rather than physical, and children are tested constantly.**

### Examples of Moral Courage Tests by Age

These examples illustrate how moral courage demands increase in complexity and social stakes as children mature:

- **Second grader**: Having the courage to admit she trampled the neighbor's prize lilies (admitting wrongdoing to an authority figure)
- **Fourth grader**: Standing up for a smaller child against a playground bully (intervening against peer aggression)
- **Sixth grader**: Listening to jazz he loves when other kids are into rap (maintaining authentic preferences against social conformity)
- **Eighth grader**: Refusing to cheat on a test even though other kids are doing so and his score will look worse by comparison (integrity under competitive pressure)
- **Tenth grader**: Refusing the sexual advances of an intimidating teacher (resisting authority-figure pressure)
- **Twelfth grader**: Insisting a drunk driver stop the car and let him out, despite taunts and dares from friends (life-or-death decision against intense social pressure)

## Handling Children's Physical Fears

Physical courage situations (fear of ferris wheels, darkness, horses, sleepovers) are relatively straightforward to address with these five strategies:

### 1. Don't Push Kids to Take Risks They Don't Feel Ready For

The reasoning: Children develop readiness at their own pace. There's no urgency - they can learn to horseback ride next year. Forcing premature exposure can backfire and deepen fears.

### 2. Stay Calm Yourself and Empathize With Their Feelings

Reframe your mindset: **This isn't an emergency; it's a learning opportunity.** Your calm presence models regulation and creates safety for processing fear.

### 3. Communicate That You Will Keep Her Safe

The underlying principle: **No one can think clearly when their nervous system thinks it's an emergency.** When children feel protected, their fear response can downregulate enough to allow problem-solving.

### 4. Help Your Child Problem Solve

Work together to find manageable steps or accommodations:
- Would it help if he knew he could call you from the sleepover?
- Could he start getting to know the horse by grooming it first, rather than climbing into the saddle?

These examples demonstrate the principle of **finding intermediate steps that maintain progress while respecting the child's current capacity.**

### 5. Encourage Your Child to Turn Fear Into Excitement

The scientific basis: **Fear and excitement are physiologically related.** Thrill seekers and researchers confirm this connection. Reframing "I'm scared" as "I'm excited" can shift the experience without denying the physical sensations.

## Moral Courage: The More Complex Challenge

### The Central Insight About Moral Courage Development

**The good and bad news about moral courage is that your child's performance in difficult situations depends mostly on you.** However, it's not what you might expect - not your lectures or drilling about right and wrong.

Why discussions about right and wrong aren't sufficient: While these conversations are important so kids clearly understand what's right and wrong and why we make certain choices, **they aren't what matters most.**

The research finding: **Most humans don't always do what they know is right.** Knowing the right answer intellectually doesn't guarantee acting on it.

The key conclusion: **Integrity cannot be taught.** Whether your child summons internal fortitude to do what's right depends on who they are as a person.

The hopeful news: **Who your child is as a person is something you can impact tremendously.**

### Moral Courage Is Developed, Not Innate

**Courage is not something we're born with.** It's something we can:
- Develop
- Cultivate
- Learn how to summon up

The development mechanism: **Trial and error, facing scary situations, choosing what's right, and finding out it works.** Each successful navigation of a moral challenge builds capacity for the next one.

## The Parent Self-Assessment: Predicting Your Child's Moral Behavior

This test about the parent's own behavior can **accurately predict the child's behavior**, according to research.

### The Assessment Questions

1. Do you tell the store clerk when she inadvertently gives you too much change?
2. Can you admit to your child when you're wrong?
3. Do you speak up to the baseball coach and tell him that boy on the bench - the one you don't know, who flubbed his last play - needs a chance to play, at least a little, in every game?
4. Do you make it safe for your child to admit to you when she makes a mistake, even a big one? Or does she feel she needs to lie to you, ever?
5. Do you support your child when she thinks an adult is wrong, and help her make her case?
6. What do you do when you discover your child took the Gameboy from the dentist's office? Do you yourself ever take a magazine you like? Do you ever take pens, pads, or other supplies from work?
7. Do you tell your boss when you think she's asking you to do something that borders on unethical?
8. Do you ever lie about your child's age to get the lower admission price?
9. Do you regularly give some portion of your income to charity?

### Why This Test Works

The underlying principle: **Children learn what we do, not what we say.** Research confirms this behavioral modeling effect. Your actions demonstrate your actual values, which children absorb and replicate.

## The Three Parts of Helping Your Child Develop Moral Courage

### Part One: Develop Your Own Moral Courage First

Because children learn from what we do rather than what we say, **the first part of helping your child develop moral courage is to develop your own.** This creates the living example they will internalize.

### Part Two: Use Teachable Moments (Without Lecturing)

When moral situations arise, the approach is:
- **Recognize aloud how hard the choice is** - validate the difficulty rather than minimizing it
- **Ask your child what they will consider as they make the choice** - prompt their own reflection
- **Ask identity-based questions**: How do they want to see themselves? What kind of person do they want to be?

The explicit warning: **Not to lecture.** The goal is facilitation of the child's own moral reasoning, not imposition of your conclusions.

### Part Three: Remember That Courage Develops With Maturity Over Time

**Don't take it too hard when your child doesn't display the courage you'd like.** This is not a failure - courage develops along with maturity.

The reassurance: **Just having a parent who thinks about these things is taking her in the right direction.** The parental attention to moral development itself influences trajectory.

The guidance: **Give her time.** Moral courage is a developmental achievement, not a switch to flip.

## Key Quotes

**Martin Luther King, Jr.**: "The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands in times of challenge and controversy."

This quote frames moral courage as the true test of character - not how we behave when it's easy, but how we behave when it's hard.

**Ambrose Redmoon**: "Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear."

This reframes courage as a values-based prioritization decision rather than an emotional state of fearlessness.
