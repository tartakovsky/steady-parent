## Core Premise: Responsive Parenting Does Not Cause Clinginess

The central reassurance is that **responsive parenting** - spending quality time playing, reading, cuddling, maintaining consistent routines, and giving attention - does not create clingy children. Brain researchers now believe that responsive engagement is essential to optimal brain and nervous system development. Thousands of studies show that responsive parenting results in *less* clinginess ultimately, producing healthier children who grow into healthier adults. There is also evidence it may raise IQ.

**Responsive parenting defined**: Tuning in to your child's signals and responding with empathy so they feel understood and safe. Critically, this does not mean shielding children from all discomfort. Instead, it means helping them feel secure enough to face challenges and discover their own inner resources, thereby building trust, resilience, and emotional regulation over time.

## Understanding Clinginess at 13 Months

### Attachment Research Framework

Research on 13-month-olds reveals three distinct patterns of attachment behavior:

**Securely attached children** (healthy attachment):
- Play happily nearby but check in frequently with parent
- Ask for help
- Wail if parent leaves the room
- When parent returns, they ask to be comforted and comfort easily

**Insecurely attached children** (anxious attachment):
- Act similarly clingy to secure children
- The critical difference: when parents return to the room, these children don't comfort easily
- They show anger at the parent upon return

**Avoidant children** (given up on parents):
- Don't seem clingy at all - this can be deceptive
- Almost ignore their parents and initiate with other adults instead
- May seem not to notice when parent leaves the room
- May seem not to notice when parent returns
- However, their blood pressure is heightened and stress hormones shoot up during separation
- Over time, these children do poorly in relationships with others, from peers to teachers
- They appear non-clingy at 13 months but are severely wounded inside

**Key insight**: While parents might think a child who separates easily at 13 months is happily independent, they would almost certainly be wrong. Separation anxiety at 13 months is completely normal and developmentally appropriate.

### The "Refueling" Concept

When a child returns to the parent frequently during play, think of these moments as **refueling**. The child is checking that the parent is accessible, getting emotional sustenance, and then venturing back out. Welcome these check-ins rather than shooing the child back to play.

Example language: "Hi, Sweetie. Did you want to come say hi to mom and get a drink of water and a hug?" After a hug, drink, or snuggle for a couple of minutes, ask if they want you to take them back to the other kids.

**Critical warning**: If you shoo him back to the other kids when he comes to refuel, he becomes *more* clingy, not less.

### Temperament Considerations

**Clinginess may be temperament, not parenting**: It is entirely possible the child would be exactly as clingy (or more clingy) without responsive parenting. Out-going-ness is partly an inherited trait. The child may simply be highly sensitive, which makes them more shy around other people at this developmental stage.

**Research on shy children**: Responsive parenting is especially important for shy kids. It helps them retain their sensitivity to others while becoming more secure in their own skins. Shy chimps raised by responsive chimp moms become leaders; shy chimps raised by less attentive moms become second-class citizens.

### Clinginess Is Developmental and Temporary

Personal example from the author: Her own son was "attached at the hip" at 13 months, only ever wanting to be with her. Developmental trajectory:
- Age 4: Wanted to ride the schoolbus to preschool
- Age 6: Having sleepovers with friends
- Age 12: Taking the New York subway by himself
- Age 14: Not homesick at three-week camp
- Age 16: Spent a month in Spain

**Key principle**: Clinginess at 13 months does not indicate the child will be clingy forever. It indicates that right now the parent is the north star of his compass, as they should be.

## Including Children in Daily Life and Chores

### The Problem with Constant Entertainment

The only concern raised about the parent's approach: waiting to do chores until naptime rather than proceeding with daily life tasks in the child's presence.

**Why this matters**: Kids shouldn't be the center of attention all the time because that puts too much pressure on them. They need to observe family activity and participate in it. Children benefit from participating in the chores of daily life.

### Decision Framework for Getting Things Done

When you need to clean the kitchen, your options:

**Option A - Play and wait for nap**: Not sustainable. If carried to extremes, not good for either parent or child.

**Option B - Put child in front of TV**: Not good for the child.

**Option C - Let child play while you clean nearby**: Always a good choice. Important: Never interrupt a child absorbed in playing.

**Option D - Let child help**: Great choice for their development.

### Practical Implementation

If child wants you to play with them: "Let's play a little, and then let's clean up the kitchen."

After playing for a bit: "Ok, I need to clean the kitchen. Do you want to keep playing with your cars or do you want to help me clean? You could sweep and wash the floor."

If child chooses to play: Great. Set it up so you can see each other while you clean and they play.

If child chooses to help: Give them a child-sized broom while you do dishes or clean out the fridge. Montessori folks recommend small brooms (available online), but you can also let them use the adult-sized one.

**Realistic expectations for toddler "help"**:
- A 13-month-old will not create a clean kitchen floor
- They will enjoy doing it
- They can sweep everything toward one corner, then you work together with the dustpan
- With mopping: the floor won't end up clean, there will be water all over
- Tip: Skip the bucket and rinse the mop yourself in the sink (buckets of water are great for washing the porch, though)
- What they will gain: enjoyment, learning, feeling of contribution
- What you will accomplish: getting the fridge cleaned or dishes done

### Running Errands with Toddlers

Taking children on errands and involving them in tasks is beneficial (assuming no carsickness).

**Examples of involvement**:
- "Will you help me pick out which pasta to buy?"
- "Can you hand the cashier the money?"
- "We have to pick up Daddy's medicine at the drugstore, and get more shampoo for you. Do you like this one or this one?"

**Benefits**: Great for developing cognitive and verbal abilities. Still part of emotional development because it's all part of the relationship.

**Realistic expectations**:
- You will not be quick and efficient - tasks will take three times as long
- You may have to cut errands short to tend to a hungry or tired child
- Keep in mind: the child is the priority
- You will still get something done
- These experiences are good for the child
- The child will regard them as fun if you handle it so it becomes fun
- Sweeten errands with a trip to the playground - children also need to just run around

## The Observe-and-Reflect Approach to Play

### The Core Technique

If involvement is so great that the child depends on it, you want them to depend on their own inner resources instead. The solution: let the child lead while you respond and reflect.

**Example in sandbox**:
- Sit on the edge while child is in sandbox
- Child starts digging
- You say: "I see you're having the bulldozer dig a big hole."
- Observe more
- Then say: "Now the cars are all driving into the hole and piling up."

**Key principles**:
- Don't initiate the play
- Don't direct it in any way
- Observe and reflect
- If child hands you a car or says "Mommy dig," then you do, but you're under their direction
- You're an actor, they're the director

**Why this works**: Kids need to direct their own play in order to develop - play is their work. Reflecting helps them feel seen and understood and develop their play. Letting them take the lead lessens their dependence on you.

### Adapting for Social Settings

At a park sandbox (vs. backyard), back off even further to open opportunity for engagement with other kids.

If child wants you next to them: You can still play observer role but broaden it to include other kids. Example: "Now Tommy's truck wants to fall in the hole too!"

**Critical insight**: The more silent you are (friendly, approving, but quiet), the more comfortable the child becomes with being out in the world with you nearby but not fully engaged. This gives them opportunity to engage with other kids.

### Proximity and Accessibility

Part of clingy behavior depends on the child's feeling that you are accessible. Counterintuitively, the child may actually act *less* clingy if you sit closer to where they're engaged with other kids.

## Socialization Recommendations for 13-Month-Olds

At 13 months, children do not really play that much with other kids, but it is important for them to be around each other. It's best if kids can be around each other with a parent present to help them navigate and solve disputes over toys.

**Recommended exposure**: If seeing other kids about three times a week, consider expanding to more contexts with parent present:
- Library reading hour
- Playground
- Museums

**Why expand**: Toddlers (which a 13-month-old is beginning to be) often get bored at home.

## Three Research-Based Factors That Can Increase Clinginess

### 1. Uncertain Communication Creates Anxiety

Research shows that moms who give kids too much uncertainty in their communication can produce clingy behavior.

**What kids need**: Firm limits and clear communication. Waffling in the name of democracy does not help them. Showing parental anxiety sabotages them.

**The spectrum**:
- Directive behavior without empathy -> makes children rebellious and hardened
- Waffling behavior -> makes children anxious and clingy

**Practical guidance**:
- Give only simple choices, and not when the stakes are high
- Good: "While you play in the sandbox with your friends, I will sit right here on this bench."
- Bad: "Do you want me to sit here? Or here? Or would you prefer me to sit there?"
- Changing your mind is acceptable: "Oh, you want me to sit with you at the sandbox for awhile today? Ok, I can do that."
- Bottom line: Kids need to feel that the parent is clearly in charge.

### 2. Suppressing Anger Creates Insecurity

Research shows that kids need to feel they can get angry at their parents or they can become more insecure and clingy.

Especially when there is a close relationship, sometimes the unconscious message given to kids is that certain feelings are off limits.

**What to communicate**: Your child will have a range of feelings that will come and go. Make sure they know:
- You love them regardless of their feelings
- All feelings are part of being human
- We sometimes get angry at those we love but the anger passes and the love always remains

### 3. Attitude Toward Sadness Matters

The parent mentioned not wanting their child to be sad.

**Reframe**: There are worse things than being sad - like feeling you can't show your sadness.

**Recommendation**: Don't intentionally do things that make the child sad, but change your attitude to regard sadness as just part of life. Allow the child to experience all emotions. This doesn't mean you can't comfort them - it means you don't make any emotion into something that isn't allowed.

**The resilience connection**: Sometimes the child will be sad. They will get through that sadness because they have you to love them through it. That's the beginning of resilience, and they need those experiences to learn how to get through them.

## The Role of the Second Parent

Research shows that fathers (or a second parent) are critically important in kids' development.

**Practical suggestion**: If the second parent can spend as much time with the child as possible, including on outings, it may help the child be less clingy with the primary caregiver.

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Responsive parenting creates security, not dependency** - The research consistently shows it leads to less clinginess over time, not more.

2. **Separation anxiety at 13 months is developmentally normal** - A child who separates too easily at this age may actually be showing signs of insecure attachment, not healthy independence.

3. **Include children in daily life** - Don't shield them from chores and errands; involve them. This reduces pressure and builds competence.

4. **Let children lead their play** - Observe and reflect rather than direct. This builds independence while maintaining connection.

5. **Welcome the "refueling"** - When children check in, embrace it rather than pushing them away. Paradoxically, this creates more independence.

6. **Be clear and confident, not waffling** - Uncertain communication creates clingy behavior. Kids need to feel the parent is in charge.

7. **Allow all emotions** - Suppressing anger or sadness in children creates insecurity. Letting them experience and move through difficult emotions builds resilience.

8. **Trust the developmental process** - The clingy 13-month-old can become the independent teenager. Trust your responsive parenting approach.
