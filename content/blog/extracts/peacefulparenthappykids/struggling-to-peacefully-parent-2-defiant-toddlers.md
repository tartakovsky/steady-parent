# Peaceful Parenting Two Defiant Toddlers: Understanding the Transition Phase

## The Core Problem: Why Children Act Worse When You Start Peaceful Parenting

When parents shift from punishment-based parenting to peaceful parenting, children often temporarily exhibit **increased defiance, running away, fighting, and screaming "I don't want to!"** This is not a sign that peaceful parenting is failing. It is a predictable transition phase that occurs precisely because the approach is working.

**The underlying mechanism**: Children become less cowed and less frightened when parents stop using punishment. This reduced fear actually enables them to express emotions and resistance they previously suppressed. The defiance is a direct result of children feeling safer, which means they no longer need to mask their true feelings.

## Understanding "Fight Mode" in Children

### Why Children Provoke Fights

When a child deliberately does things to anger a parent, refuses to cry, and instead screams, shows anger, or whines loudly, they are entering **fight mode**. The child is using the principle that "the best defense is a good offense."

**The emotional logic behind fight mode**: Children accumulate sad, mad, and scary feelings over time. When they begin to feel the warmth of a parent's compassion and empathy, these buried feelings start surfacing to be healed. This is uncomfortable and scary for the child. To avoid feeling these vulnerable emotions, they start a fight instead. Fighting keeps them in an angry, defended state rather than a vulnerable, tearful one.

**Key insight**: A child who fights rather than cries is avoiding vulnerability. The anger and defiance serve as armor protecting against deeper feelings of sadness or fear.

### The "Fight to Get Comfort" Pattern

Some children will provoke conflict specifically because they want the holding and comfort that comes afterward. This is not manipulation in a negative sense. It reveals that the child needs connection and physical comfort but does not know how to ask for it directly or access it without going through conflict first.

## The Core Strategy: Do Not Fight Back

### The Sidestep Technique

When children resist with "I don't want to!" and escalate to fighting or running:

1. **Temporarily back off** from whatever you wanted them to do
2. **Empathize with the emotion** they are expressing, not the behavior
3. **Stay patient** and refuse to engage in the power struggle

The reason for backing off temporarily is strategic, not permissive. You are not abandoning the limit. You are refusing to engage in the fight that the child is using to avoid their feelings.

### The Empathy Script

When a child is in fight mode, use empathy statements that:
- Name the emotion they are showing ("You are so mad")
- Validate their desire to act out ("You are so mad that you want to hit/throw")
- Give them acceptable outlets ("You can be as mad as you want, and you can tell me in words... You can stomp your foot to show me")
- Hold the limit without punishment ("And I won't let you hurt anyone")
- Name the deeper feeling underneath the anger ("I think you are sad inside, too, because I said no")
- Acknowledge how hard the situation is for them ("It is so hard when you want X and I say no")

**Example script**: "You are so mad that you want to hit/throw. You can be as mad as you want, and you can tell me in words... You can stomp your foot to show me... And I won't let you hurt anyone... I think you are sad inside, too, because I said no. It is so hard when you want X and I say no."

### Why Empathy Leads to Crying, and Why Crying Matters

**The healing sequence**: Empathy -> Tears -> Cooperation

When children receive genuine empathy, they respond by crying. The tears indicate that they have moved from defended anger into the vulnerable feelings underneath. After crying, children become more cooperative because they have shown the parent their feelings and are no longer stuck in them. The emotional backlog has been released, allowing them to move on.

**Critical point**: The goal is not to stop the tantrum. The goal is to help the child move from fighting (defended) to crying (vulnerable). The crying is the healing process.

## Managing Parent Emotions

### Why This Approach Is Difficult

The approach is hard primarily because **managing your own emotions is hard**. When patience is already wearing thin, it becomes nearly impossible to respond with empathy rather than frustration.

### The Reframe Technique

When you feel your patience running out:

1. **Breathe** to regulate your own nervous system
2. **Reframe** the situation by actively trying to see it from the child's point of view
3. **Generate genuine compassion** through understanding their experience

The reframe is not a trick or a fake-it-till-you-make-it technique. The purpose is to actually shift your internal experience so you feel real compassion. This compassion is healing for both you and the child. You cannot effectively help a child through big emotions while you are dysregulated yourself.

## Anti-Patterns and What to Avoid

### Fighting Back

Engaging in the power struggle that the child initiates. This keeps both parent and child in fight mode, preventing the child from accessing the vulnerable feelings that need to be released.

### Interpreting Defiance as Failure

Seeing increased resistance as proof that peaceful parenting does not work. The increased defiance during the transition is evidence that the child feels safer, not evidence of failure.

### Expecting Immediate Results

Peaceful parenting during a transition phase requires patience. The shift takes time and the child needs to work through accumulated emotions.

### Mistaking Fight Mode for Genuine Anger

When a child screams and shows anger but does not cry, they are likely in fight mode, using anger as a defense. Treating this as simple anger misses the vulnerable feelings underneath that need attention.

## Key Concepts Summary

**Connection through empathy**: The solution to defiance is not more control but more connection. Empathy while setting limits and throughout the day is what shifts the dynamic.

**Defiance as safety signal**: Children who were previously compliant due to fear may become defiant when they feel safer. This defiance indicates progress, not regression.

**Fight mode as defense**: Children use fighting and anger to avoid vulnerable feelings. The parent's job is to help them feel safe enough to drop the defense and cry.

**Tears as healing**: Crying releases the emotional backlog that drives difficult behavior. Cooperation naturally follows emotional release.

**Parent regulation first**: Parents cannot effectively guide children through big emotions while dysregulated themselves. Breathing and reframing are essential tools for maintaining the patience required for this approach.
