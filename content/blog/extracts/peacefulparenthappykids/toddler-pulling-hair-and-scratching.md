## Core Insight: Reframe the Behavior as a Bid for Connection

When a toddler (around 22 months) pulls hair or scratches and laughs while doing it, this may appear to be attention-seeking for a reaction, but should be **reframed as a bid for connection**. The laughter is not necessarily indicative of malicious intent or enjoyment of causing pain. Instead, the child may be trying to get the parent's attention and establish connection, even though they are using an inappropriate method to do so.

The key diagnostic question is: **Is there something that might be pulling the parent's attention away?** A new baby in the house is one common trigger that can cause toddlers to escalate behaviors to recapture attention and connection they feel they have lost.

## The Response Protocol

### Step 1: Immediate Physical Separation

When the child pulls hair even a little, **immediately move away**. This serves two purposes:
- It protects you from further pain
- It creates a physical boundary that signals the behavior is not acceptable

### Step 2: Self-Regulation Before Re-Engagement

**Calm yourself** before returning to the child. This is essential because:
- Your emotional state directly influences the interaction
- Reacting from frustration or anger would model dysregulation
- A calm approach enables you to respond rather than react

### Step 3: Reconnect Through Physical Affection and Playfulness

Return to the child and initiate connection with playful language: **"Hey, are you out of hugs again?"**

Then immediately provide physical connection:
- Pick the child up
- Hug them
- Throw them around (playful physical engagement)
- Get them laughing

This physical play and affection directly addresses the underlying need the child was trying to meet through the problematic behavior.

### Step 4: Teach an Alternative Communication Method

After meeting the need, explicitly teach a replacement behavior: **"Hey, when you need more hugs, just say 'Hug Mommy!' and I will hug you!"**

This provides the child with:
- A socially appropriate way to express the same need
- Words to use instead of physical actions
- A clear expectation of what will happen when they use the new method (they will get hugs)

## Critical Distinction: Meeting Needs vs. Rewarding Behavior

**This approach is not rewarding the hair-pulling.** The distinction matters:

- **Rewarding** would mean the child learns "when I pull hair, I get hugs" and is therefore incentivized to continue pulling hair
- **Meeting the underlying need** means the child learns "my need for connection will be met, and there is a better way to ask for it"

The protocol addresses the root cause (need for connection) rather than just suppressing the symptom (hair pulling). By teaching an alternative behavior immediately after meeting the need, you redirect the child toward appropriate ways of getting the same result.

## Why the Behavior Escalates

The parent reported that the child "will pull my hair until I raise my voice to him." This escalation pattern reveals:
- The child continues until they get a response
- Negative attention (raised voice) is still attention
- The child's persistence indicates the need is strong enough to tolerate discomfort (parent's negative reaction) to get it met

This persistence is evidence that the behavior is driven by a genuine need rather than simple testing or malice.

## Parent Self-Regulation Challenge

The parent acknowledged: "I try my hardest not to get angry but it hurts." This highlights the difficulty of the situation:
- The physical pain is real and triggers a natural protective response
- The frustration builds over repeated incidents
- Maintaining calm requires conscious effort

The protocol accounts for this by building in the step to move away and calm yourself before re-engaging. This acknowledges that parents need a moment to regulate their own nervous system before they can effectively help their child.
