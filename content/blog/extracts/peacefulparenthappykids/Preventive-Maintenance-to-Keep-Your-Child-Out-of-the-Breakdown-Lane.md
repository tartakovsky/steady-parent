# Preventive Maintenance: Keeping Children Emotionally Regulated

## Core Philosophy: Prevention Over Reaction

The central insight is that parenting works like car maintenance. A car that doesn't receive regular gas, oil changes, and tune-ups will end up in the breakdown lane. Children work the same way - without regular emotional maintenance, they will have meltdowns and behavioral breakdowns.

**The critical implication**: Once a breakdown is happening, your options become extremely limited. Just as you can't fix most car problems while stranded on the highway, you can't effectively address the underlying issues when your two-year-old is in full meltdown mode in a car seat, or when your twelve-year-old is already lying about drinking with friends. The leverage point is before the crisis, not during it.

This becomes especially important with multiple children - you simply cannot always be available for each child's meltdown when it happens. Therefore, **prevention must be your primary parenting strategy**, not crisis management.

When ongoing problems with a child persist, the right question is: "What preventive maintenance might keep us from ending up in the breakdown lane so often?"

## The Five Preventive Maintenance Habits

### 1. Empathy and Connection as the Default Mode

**The 90/10 Principle**: Ninety percent of interactions with your child should be about connecting, so they can accept the 10 percent that are about correcting.

Why this ratio matters: Children need a strong foundation of feeling understood and connected before they can tolerate limits and corrections without emotional dysregulation.

**Empathy as the primary connection tool**:
- Strengthens the parent-child relationship
- Helps you understand your child better
- Helps the child feel understood

**The emotional backpack mechanism**: When a child feels understood, they feel safe enough to process emotions as they happen. If they don't feel safe, they "stuff" emotions into an emotional backpack where they accumulate and eventually burst out uncontrolled at a later, usually inconvenient time.

Processing emotions in the moment (rather than stuffing them) is what develops the child's emotional skills to manage feelings and behavior - even when they don't like your limits.

### 2. Daily Roughhousing for Laughter

**Why children accumulate anxiety**: Children build up anxiety (mild fear) throughout each day for multiple reasons:
- They are small people in a big, chaotic, unsafe world
- Their brains are still developing, so they often feel overwhelmed by big emotions
- They have little control over what happens to them, so they feel pushed around
- They carry fears ranging from mundane (what if the teacher calls on me?) to existential (what if you stopped loving me, or died?)

**Nature's release valve - giggling**: Laughter is designed as the human mechanism for off-loading anxiety. The best way to trigger this release is through physical games that mildly provoke a small fear response.

**Examples that demonstrate this principle**:
- **Peekaboo**: The child giggles because it touches their fear that you could really disappear for good
- **Tossing in the air**: The laughter comes from the mild fear that you could actually drop them

The pattern: mild, safe exposure to something that touches a fear -> giggling -> anxiety release.

**Additional benefits of roughhousing**:
- Triggers bonding hormones that build trust
- Especially critical for highly sensitive children or those with past traumas (large or small) to work through
- Important for children transitioning from conventional parenting that involved punishment and yelling - roughhousing helps rebuild trust

**Warning about tickling**: Tickling is NOT the recommended way to get children laughing because:
- It appears to involve a different physiological response
- It doesn't accomplish the goal of anxiety release
- It can make children feel out of control

**Alternative if your child begs for tickling**: Use "pretend tickling" where you threaten to tickle but don't make actual contact. The child will still laugh, getting the benefit without the downsides. Once you develop other games that get your child laughing, they'll stop asking for real tickling.

### 3. Daily One-on-One Special Time

**Why it's needed**: Life naturally disconnects us from each other. Regular reconnection is required to counteract this drift.

**What Special Time accomplishes**:
- Builds trust
- Fosters self-esteem
- Helps children work through big emotions

**How to do Special Time**:
- Daily, with each child individually
- Turn off your phone (yes, really!)
- Let the child take the lead
- Simply delight in your child

**Observed results**: Parents who implement daily Special Time report dramatic reduction in problems including:
- Aggression between siblings
- Tantrums
- Power struggles
- Defiance

The pattern: consistent one-on-one attention -> child feels more connected and valued -> behavioral problems decrease.

### 4. Routines and Structure

**Why routines work**: You don't need to be a slave to the schedule, but regular routines provide multiple benefits:
- Minimize your job as "head cop" (less enforcement needed)
- Reduce power struggles
- Increase child's sense of safety and predictability

**Routines ensure basic needs are met**: Regular routines make it more likely that children get adequate:
- Sleep
- Food
- Unscheduled time

Meeting these basic needs gives children more inner resources to face the day's demands without breaking down.

**Connection opportunities within routines**: Build connection moments into the routine itself:
- Morning snuggle with each child
- Family hug and high five before leaving the house
- Appreciations all around the table at dinner

Why this matters: When children feel connected, they feel more cooperative, which makes the routine itself go more smoothly. It's a positive feedback loop.

**Pro Tip for reducing power struggles**: Work with your child to take photos of the routine and make a chart. This allows them to take charge of moving through the routine themselves. The underlying principle: All children want to be "in charge" of themselves. Give them age-appropriate ways to exercise control, and they stop fighting you for it.

### 5. Welcoming Emotions (Including Scheduled Meltdowns)

**How emotions work**: Emotions are messages. Once we receive the message, emotions begin to evaporate. If we try to push emotions away, we may push them out of conscious awareness, but the feelings remain in the body, waiting to be noticed.

**The Emotional Backpack concept**: Unexpressed emotions get "lugged around" until we have a safe opportunity to feel them and let them go.

**Two levels of emotional support**:
1. Sometimes empathy alone is enough - the child can notice what they're feeling and move through it with your supportive presence
2. Other times, children need more - they become whiny, demanding, impossible to please, try to pick fights. They can't express it in words, but they know something feels wrong. **This signals that the child needs to cry.**

**Reframing crying**: Welcome tears - they're nature's way of healing. Don't sigh and hope the child snaps out of it. Instead, view crankiness, aggression, or general unhappiness as red lights on the dashboard. Time for preventive maintenance.

**The Scheduled Meltdown**

What it is: The same meltdown your child would have had at the playground or supermarket, except:
- It happens in the safety of home
- You can really listen and empathize
- There's no pressure from schedules or onlookers

**How to facilitate a scheduled meltdown**:

**Step 1 - Prepare yourself first**: Acknowledge any irritation you have at your child and shift yourself to a more empathic frame of mind. This is essential because unless you do, your child won't feel safe enough to move past their anger to the more upsetting feelings behind both the anger and the "bad" behavior.

**Step 2 - Set a kind limit about the current behavior**:
> "Sweetie, you're yelling, and that hurts my ears. Can you tell me what you want in an inside voice?"

**Step 3 - If anger escalates, ratchet up empathy**:
> "Oh, Sweetie, I see you're upset... I'm sorry this is so hard."

**The mechanism**: Your warm presence creates the safety needed for the child to feel uncomfortable tears and fears behind their anger. If you stay compassionate enough (the challenge for most parents), they'll feel safe enough to go behind the anger and show you their hurts.

**What happens after**: Sometimes they can express feelings verbally, but often they'll just need to cry. Afterward, they feel better - and act better.

**Critical warning about anger**: It isn't the anger that's therapeutic. It's showing you the more vulnerable feelings driving the anger. This is why you don't respond to the child's invitation to fight by fighting back. Instead, you create safety.

**What children need**: A witness to brave all the hurt, loneliness, powerlessness, and fear they've been stuffing down.

**The payoff**: After a good cry, the child returns to their best self, feels closer to you, and - crucially - you've gotten the meltdown out of the way at a time when you could really listen. You've just prevented the tantrum that would have happened at an inconvenient moment, like when you had to leave the house to pick up their sibling.

## Summary of the Framework

The five preventive maintenance habits form an interconnected system:

1. **Empathy** - Makes children feel understood, preventing emotional stuffing
2. **Roughhousing** - Releases accumulated anxiety through laughter
3. **Special Time** - Maintains connection against life's natural drift toward disconnection
4. **Routines** - Ensures basic needs are met and reduces power struggles
5. **Welcoming Emotions** - Allows scheduled release of built-up feelings before they cause unplanned breakdowns

**The time investment reframes**: This preventive work actually saves time. Children raised with these five habits develop better emotional regulation, which means better behavioral regulation. The whole family spends more time laughing and connecting, and less time in the breakdown lane.
