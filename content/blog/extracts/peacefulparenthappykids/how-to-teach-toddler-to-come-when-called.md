## Core Understanding: Why Toddlers Don't Come When Called

The behavior of not coming when called is **completely normal for toddlers around 21 months old**. A child who is generally cooperative but doesn't respond to being called is simply going through a predictable developmental stage, not being defiant.

### The Toddler's Perspective

When you call a toddler's name, several things happen from their point of view:

1. **They don't understand conversational rules** - They don't know that not answering is considered rude. They simply haven't learned this social convention yet.

2. **Their current activity feels more important** - Whatever they're engaged in seems more valuable than whatever you might want. This isn't defiance; it's how their priorities work.

3. **They may not understand the expectation** - Unless you explicitly say something like "Come to me right now!" they may not realize that's what you want when you call their name.

4. **They anticipate unwanted transitions** - Even if they understand you want them to come, they often know what comes next (bath time, putting on coat, cleaning up toys). Transitions are inherently hard for toddlers. If you're standing by the bathtub, they know coming means being stripped and put in water - even if they like baths, the transition itself triggers resistance.

### The Parent's Perspective vs. Reality

Parents naturally want their child to obey directives, especially imagining dangerous situations where the child would need to come immediately. The reassurance here: **someday they will come running when called in emergencies, but at 21 months this may be too much to expect**. This is a developmental limitation, not a training failure.

## The Training Principle: Make Learning Fun

The fundamental approach is that **the best teaching happens when the student finds the lessons totally entertaining**. This isn't just a nice-to-have - games strengthen the parent-child relationship while teaching the skill, so there's no downside to investing time in playful teaching.

## The Eight-Step Method

### Step 1: Stop Calling From Across the Room (Immediately)

**The Problem**: If you call and she doesn't come, you are actively training her to ignore you. Every time you call and she doesn't respond, you reinforce that pattern.

**The Action**: Completely stop calling from a distance for at least one month. After a month, reintroduce it only as a game (detailed in Step 6).

### Step 2: Rely on Physical Proximity for Safety

**The Principle**: In any potentially dangerous situation, use your arms rather than your voice to get her to safety.

**Why This Matters**: Don't rely on verbal commands to protect your child. Stay physically close enough to grab and move her when needed. Your proximity is your safety tool, not your voice.

### Step 3: Train Eye Contact as the Foundation

Eye contact when you say their name is the first step toward coming when called. You need to build this foundation before expecting them to move toward you.

**The Method**:
- Get down on her level, right next to her
- Say her name
- If she looks up, reward immediately with a big smile, a hug, and say "I love to see your eyes!"
- Crucially: **Don't interrupt what she's doing** - this would punish her for responding to you

**If She Doesn't Look Up**:
- Make it a game by saying her name repeatedly in a teasing, loving voice
- Simultaneously kiss her on her head, arms, etc.
- The goal is to associate hearing her name with loving touch and fun

**Timing Caveat**: Don't initiate this game when she's trying to focus on something like a favorite video. That would just irritate her and create negative associations.

### Step 4: Replace Calling With Going To Her (For Now)

When you actually need your daughter to come to you, don't call her. Instead:

1. Go over to her physically
2. Stoop down to her level
3. Make eye contact
4. Explain what's next on the agenda
5. Take her hand, or pick her up, to move her

**The Five-Minute Warning Technique**:
- Go over five minutes in advance
- Make eye contact
- Give a warning: "In five minutes it will be bath time and we'll need to stop playing"

**The Choice Enhancement**:
Giving a choice makes the warning even more effective:
- "Do you want to take your bath now or in five minutes?"
- When she says five minutes: "Ok, in five minutes I will come back for you and we will stop playing and go have a fun bath with no fuss, right?"

This gives her a sense of control while still establishing the transition will happen.

### Step 5: Use Stuffed Animals to Act Out the Behavior

This is an educational/modeling technique using pretend play.

**The Setup**:
- Ideally use a mom and baby bear, but any big stuffed animal and little one works
- Have the "Mommy" animal call "Come here please, I NEED you!" to the "Baby"
- When the Baby responds and comes, the Mommy gives a huge hug and makes a loving fuss
- Then the Baby helps the Mommy with something (like finding something that's lost)

**Critical Detail**: Have your daughter participate with one of the stuffed animals, acting it out with you. **Make sure she plays both roles** - both the one calling and the one responding.

The phrase **"I NEED you!"** is introduced here and becomes important in later steps.

### Step 6: Reintroduce Calling - As a Game (After One Month)

**Timing**: Only after a month of not calling from across the room.

**Conditions for Success**:
- Pick a time when she's not focused on something that will make it hard to get her attention
- Start by calling from right next to her (she won't actually have to move)

**The Game Method**:
- Hold the "Mommy" stuffed animal in front of you
- Have the stuffed animal do the calling using your daughter's name plus "I NEED You!"
- This makes it an irresistible game rather than a command

**If She Comes Into Your Arms**:
- Both you AND the stuffed animal hug her
- Make a loving fuss over her

**If She Doesn't Come**:
- Scoop her up in your arms anyway
- Say "Here you are! I NEED You!"
- Make a loving fuss over her **as if she had come**

**Gradual Progression**: Keep doing this until she reliably moves into your arms for her hug, then begin moving just a tiny bit away as you call. The distance increases only after reliability is established at closer range.

### Step 7: Never Punish or Be Stern for Not Responding

**The Mindset**: Remind yourself that she's a toddler. This is developmentally normal.

**The Approach**:
- Continue to reward the behavior you want
- Ignore the behavior you don't want
- If you call once and she doesn't respond, say to yourself "Not today, I guess"
- Go over and pick her up
- Say "I called you because I NEED you!"
- She will be happy to be interrupted and in your arms

The key phrase "I NEED you" continues to be used, building the association.

### Step 8: The Payoff - Make Her Feel Needed and Valued

**The Goal State**: Eventually, your daughter will come running when you call and ask "You need me, Mommy?"

**How to Respond When This Happens**:
- Find something you need her help with, even if small
- Make her feel valued and indispensable

**Examples of Help Tasks**:
- "Only you can tell me if this water is the right temperature. What do you think?"
- Find her shoes so you can leave the house
- Turn on the faucet for hand-washing before dinner
- Help figure out which toys go where

**The Underlying Psychology**: Kids need to feel valued. She gradually learns that the payoff for responding to your call is the wonderful feeling of being needed and valued by the most important person in her world.

Even if you're calling her for something like bath time, you reward her response with:
1. A big hug
2. A task that makes her feel important

## Key Phrases to Use

- **"I love to see your eyes!"** - Used as reward for eye contact
- **"I NEED you!"** - The call phrase that signals importance and creates the valued-helper dynamic
- **"In five minutes..."** - Warning phrase for transitions
- **"Do you want X now or in five minutes?"** - Choice-giving phrase

## What NOT to Do (Anti-Patterns)

1. **Don't call from across the room** (at least for the first month) - This trains her to ignore you
2. **Don't punish or be stern** when she doesn't respond - She's a toddler; this is developmentally normal
3. **Don't interrupt her activity** as a consequence of responding - This punishes the behavior you want
4. **Don't initiate the name-game** when she's focused on something important to her - This creates irritation and negative associations
5. **Don't rely on your voice for safety** - Use physical proximity instead
6. **Don't expect too much too soon** - At 21 months, immediate obedience may simply be developmentally unrealistic

## The Progression Timeline

1. **Immediately**: Stop calling from across the room; use physical proximity for all actual needs
2. **Ongoing (first month)**: Train eye contact through the name-saying game at close range
3. **Ongoing**: Use stuffed animal role-play to model the coming-when-called behavior
4. **After one month**: Reintroduce calling as a game with stuffed animals, starting at close range
5. **Gradually**: Increase distance only after reliability is established at each stage
6. **Eventually**: She comes running asking "You need me, Mommy?" and you reward with feeling-valued tasks

## Core Principles Underlying This Approach

1. **Reward what you want, ignore what you don't want** - Classical behavior shaping
2. **Make learning feel like play** - The best teaching is when the student finds lessons entertaining
3. **Build foundational skills first** - Eye contact before movement, close range before distance
4. **Understand the child's perspective** - Their priorities and developmental stage explain the behavior
5. **Create positive associations** - Name + loving touch + fun = wanting to respond
6. **Give children agency and value** - Feeling needed and indispensable motivates cooperation
7. **Physical proximity over verbal commands for safety** - Don't rely on unreliable systems
