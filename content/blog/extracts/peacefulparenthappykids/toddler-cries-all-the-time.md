# Understanding and Helping a Toddler Who Cries Constantly

## Core Framework: Why Toddlers Cry at Everything

**Tears in response to transitions and new things signal that a child feels overwhelmed and unable to rise to the occasion.** This is significant because toddlers face constant developmental tasks, and if they don't feel up to tackling them, they may "retire to their beds" or withdraw. This pattern of hiding from life interferes with development and can become entrenched.

### Three Possible Root Causes

1. **Fear** - particularly fear of new situations. The child needs help processing and releasing the fear.

2. **Grief and mourning** - especially common with a new sibling. The "retiring to bed" behavior suggests this cause. The child needs help with grief and strengthening of the parent-child relationship.

3. **Physical overwhelm** - when the body makes the child feel bad physically, everything becomes overwhelming. Just as adults struggle when physically unwell, children may cry at everything when their bodies are struggling.

## The Physical/Medical Dimension

**The body as well as the mind can be a source of emotion.** Sometimes children have food allergies or sensitivities that cause:
- Irritability
- Low frustration tolerance
- Over-reactions to stimuli
- Depressive symptoms
- Frequent crying

**The Feingold diet** has produced "miracle cures" in some children with these symptoms. Worth investigating:
- Check peanut butter for additives (conventional brands often contain them)
- Rule out peanut allergies
- Consider dairy allergies even with yogurt
- Note that gut bacteria influence mood - probiotics are thought to positively affect mood

## The Emotional Reservoir Theory

### How Emotions Work in Children

**All humans have emotions in response to perceptions, and once we have the opportunity to "feel" those feelings, the emotions dissipate and vanish.** We all need a "witness" at times to help us explore big feelings.

Adults can change their perceptions and thus change their emotions (reframing: "Maybe my parents having another baby doesn't mean they were replacing me because I wasn't good enough"). But little ones don't yet have the reflective capacity for this kind of cognitive reframing.

### Why Toddlers Store Up Feelings

Toddlers have lots of big emotions that overwhelm them. They store these emotions until they have a safe place to let them out, which usually means the arms of a loving parent.

**Nature has provided toddlers with tantrums as a fail-safe way to express emotions** since they are no longer "in arms" as much as infants.

### When Stuffing Happens

A toddler stuffs feelings instead of expressing them when:
- She doesn't feel safe (for instance, at school)
- She doesn't have an accepting witness (maybe the parent is uncomfortable with her anger, sadness, or fear)
- She is very sensitive (and thus has even more big feelings than most toddlers)

**Critical insight: Feelings that are stuffed don't just go away. They force their way to the surface in the form of tears or angry behavior.**

### The Pressure Model

A child with a reservoir of stored-up feelings experiences constant pressure from these emotions. This pressure:
- Keeps her from engaging with life
- Spills out as tears whenever she feels overwhelmed
- Creates the pattern of crying at everything

## The Witnessing Protocol: How to Help a Child Release Stored Emotions

### Setting Up the Session

At the next opportunity when your daughter begins to cry and you have another adult available to care for the baby, **welcome her tears**. See this as an opportunity for her to unload the heavy baggage weighing her down.

### What to Say During Witnessing

Hold her and say things like:
- "Oh, Sweetie, I see your big tears, you have such big feelings..."
- "That's ok... Everybody needs to cry sometimes..."
- "I am right here... I will keep you safe..."
- "I will hold you... You can cry as much as you want..."
- "You are doing such a good job with your big feelings..."

### Expected Response and What It Means

**Hopefully, your daughter will respond by crying even harder.** This is a good sign - don't let it scare you.

### Parent's Role During the Session

- **Breathe** - remind yourself you are being a witness and don't have to solve anything
- **Don't take her tears personally**
- **You are her partner in the hard work she is doing - let her take the lead**
- It's fine to say "I see how sad you are"
- **Do NOT analyze her** (saying "Maybe you are sad about the new baby" will make her feel less safe)
- Don't be surprised if she begins making comments showing the source of her feelings
- Just empathize with such comments, showing she is allowed to have those feelings and you understand them (even if you don't agree)

### When Fear is the Stored Emotion

When little ones express fear, they often:
- Flail around
- Tremble
- Sweat
- Cry without tears
- Want to push against the parent

**What to do:** Welcome this behavior and keep your hand on her if possible to help her feel your solid presence. Remind her in a soothing voice that you are there and will keep her safe.

### Session Duration and Frequency

Sessions can last for half an hour to an hour. You may need to go through several sessions like this. **After she gets some of her fear out, you will find her a changed girl, much more able to greet life with courage.**

## The Giggle Release Pathway

**Anything that helps your daughter giggle is releasing the same anxieties that she otherwise releases with tears.** Laughter and tears serve the same emotional release function.

### Physical Games That Help

Play physical games that make her laugh and make her feel powerful:
- Pillow fights that she wins
- Chase her and fall down
- Cling to her so that she gets to be the powerful one and move away from you

The key element is **making the child feel powerful** in the play.

## Special Time Protocol

### Structure
Set aside half an hour a day for Special Time with your daughter.

### Naming
Call it by her name - "the most special name there is." Tell her that it's special time and you want to play a special game with her.

### Content
Initiate physical games designed to:
- Strengthen your connection with her
- Increase her confidence

### What Happens Over Time
As the days go by, her trust in you will increase. This increased trust means she'll be more ready for big cries to let out those big feelings.

### Emotional Melt-Down Possibility
She may well get triggered and begin to cry in protest as you wrap up a rough-housing game during Special Time. **Always give yourself extra time at the end of Special Time for an emotional melt-down.**

## Understanding Regression and Dependency Needs

### The New Sibling Context

**When there is a new baby in the family, toddlers often revert to wanting to be babied and ask to be fed.** There is no reason to refuse her. You are not "spoiling" her but meeting a legitimate need.

### When Regression Becomes Rigid

If the child has become rigid about needing to be fed and never feeds herself, let her play out her big feelings about who gets their need for nurturance met by playing games around it.

**Example:** Make her feed you. Keep it VERY light and silly. You are going for giggles, not tears. After some play like this, she may insist on feeding herself.

### Parents' Own Issues with Dependency

**Most of us as parents have issues about our child's dependency needs.** We got the message as children ourselves to stuff those needs, and we unconsciously give that message to our own children.

**Solution:** Find someone you trust to express all your feelings about your daughter and this issue - your husband, sister, best friend - someone who will not judge and will not solve. You just need a place to vent your own feelings with a trusted witness.

**After this, you will find yourself more able to respond with compassion to your daughter's tears, which will help her not to get reactively locked into them.**

## Practical Application: Handling Specific Triggering Situations

### Greeting Family Members (Grandparents, Cousins)

When a child cries when greeting relatives:
1. **Prep her** in advance for the situation
2. **Make a game of the greeting** that helps her feel confident in the situation
3. Let her greet them but **on her own terms**

The goal is giving the child agency and confidence in the challenging situation.

## The Importance of Parent Support

**For us as parents to give our children the support to work through something like this, we need support ourselves.** This means having trusted confidants with whom we can process our own emotions.

Without this support, parents may:
- Find it hard to respond with compassion consistently
- Unconsciously communicate that dependency needs should be stuffed
- Become less creative in handling their child's reactions

## Understanding the Trigger: When Did This Start?

Something changed - either in the child or in her life - that started this behavior. **Can you remember when it started?** If so, that clue could be very helpful.

### Environmental Factors to Consider

- Has the child been under the care of a pregnant or postpartum mother (who may have less energy/patience)?
- Has any discipline approach other than empathic limits been used? (This can be a contributing factor for sensitive toddlers)
- Are there health issues or family stress? (Little ones pick up on our emotions and express them)

## Warning: The Danger of Withdrawal

**Crying in response to transitions and new things - which means most of what a toddler experiences - is a concern.** It's not only that the child is unhappy, but that toddlers have so many developmental tasks to tackle. If they don't feel up to it and just retire to their beds, that:
- Gets in the way of their development
- Sets up a pattern of hiding from life

This pattern can become self-reinforcing if not addressed.

## Expected Outcome

With love and acceptance, and applying these approaches consistently, **you will see your daughter begin to move out of this phase and become braver about life.**
