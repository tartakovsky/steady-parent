## Core Principle: The Child Wants to Succeed

The foundational principle for addressing potty accidents is understanding that **the child wants to be successful**. If a child is not succeeding at using the potty, it is not because they are a "bad child" or because they do not want to succeed. Something is getting in the way of their success. The parent's job is to figure out what is blocking success and help the child solve that problem.

Shaming or getting angry at the child will only make it harder for them to be successful. This is because toilet learning involves bodily functions that are sensitive to emotional states, and negative emotions create tension that interferes with the physical processes involved.

## Distinguishing Between Types of Accidents

### Full Bladder Emptying vs. Leakage

There is an important distinction between two types of accidents:

1. **Full bladder emptying accidents**: When a child runs behind the couch or hides somewhere and fully empties their bladder. This is most likely an expression of anxiety or anger. It represents an emotional issue manifesting through behavior.

2. **Leakage accidents**: When small amounts of urine leak out, even shortly after the child has used the toilet (such as 20 minutes later). This suggests a physiological issue rather than a behavioral one. The bladder may not be emptying fully, or something may be physically putting pressure on the bladder.

This distinction matters enormously because the treatment approach differs completely. A child with leakage cannot control it through willpower or motivation alone because it stems from a physical cause that must be addressed first.

## The Fecal Retention-Urine Leakage Connection

### How Holding Poop Causes Urine Leakage

**This is a critical concept**: When a child routinely holds in their poop, the colon can become full even when the child does manage to poop sometimes. The full colon puts pressure on the bladder, causing urine to leak out in small amounts.

Key indicators that fecal retention may be the underlying cause:

- Child will only poop with one specific caregiver (such as only with mom)
- Child holds poop until sleep time when they have a diaper on
- Child leaks urine even shortly after using the toilet
- Child wakes up with soaked diapers from naps or nighttime sleep
- Leakage is worse in the afternoon/later in the day (the "danger zone" between naptime and dinnertime)

### Why Nighttime and Naptime Accidents Occur with Fecal Retention

If the colon is putting pressure on the bladder, the child has to exercise a great deal of control all day long to prevent constant leaking. When they sleep and let their guard down, the urine comes flooding out. This explains why a child might wake up soaking wet even from a short 1.5-hour nap.

This also explains the pattern where accidents are worse at home than at school. The child is using enormous energy to maintain control at school (where only 1 accident every 10 days occurs), but by afternoon at home, their control is exhausted (resulting in 1-4 accidents daily).

**Important insight**: Think how hard the child is trying all day long to keep the pee in. They would need to sit on the toilet constantly to be successful if the underlying pressure issue is not resolved.

## Proper Voiding Technique for Girls

A small percentage of girls suffer from leakage about 15 minutes after urinating because they have not fully emptied their bladders. Teaching proper peeing technique can clear up this issue. The rest of us learn to pee well enough without explicit instructions, but some children's bodies need extra help.

### The Four-Step Technique for Complete Bladder Emptying

1. **Sit steadily on the toilet brim with legs fully supported** - stability allows for proper muscle relaxation

2. **Keep legs well apart** - this positioning allows for better urinary flow

3. **Lean the trunk forward as much as possible** - this makes the pelvic tilt forward and the urinary stream more vertical, allowing gravity to assist in emptying

4. **Separate the labia before voiding** - At the end of voiding, use toilet paper to press and lift the perineum forward/upward (from the base of the vagina and away from the rectum) to empty urine fully

This technique should be taught even if the parent suspects a bigger underlying issue, as it may be all the child needs.

## Readiness Indicators for Toilet Training

One key readiness indicator that determines whether a child is truly ready to toilet train is **whether they wake up dry from sleep**. If a child consistently wakes up with soaked diapers from naps, this calls into question whether they were actually ready to begin toilet training.

### When Starting Too Early May Be the Issue

Even if a child showed initial motivation (excited about panties, earning stickers, doing well at first), the pattern of continued accidents over many months may indicate the training started before the child was developmentally ready.

Some children master toilet training by age 3, but **plenty of normal children master this skill toward age 4**. The goal is to make the process as non-traumatic as possible for both child and parent. Making a child feel like a failure because parents are expecting something they are simply not ready to do creates additional problems.

However, once training has been underway for months and the child has been trying hard, the goal shifts to moving forward and helping them succeed rather than going back entirely.

## The Role of Fear in Toilet Learning

### Location-Specific Resistance

When a child will poop in the toilet with one person (such as mom) but refuses with anyone else (school, babysitter), this indicates fear is playing a role. The child feels safe enough to poop only in certain conditions.

### Using Play to Address Fears

**The Hand-in-Hand approach**: Use play and pretend to help children discharge tension about toileting fears.

**Specific technique for location-specific resistance**:

1. Play "school" with stuffed animals
2. Have one animal refuse to poop in the toilet and instead ask for a diaper for naptime
3. Keep it lighthearted and silly - do not make it heavy
4. Exaggerate the little animal's fears and demands to make the child laugh
5. Have the animal almost fall in the toilet, or be afraid the poop will hurt, or whatever makes the child laugh
6. The more the child laughs, the more tension they are discharging about their own fears

**Sign you are on the right track**: The child laughs during the play.

### Escalating the Pretend Play

If spontaneous pooping at school/babysitter does not begin after general play:

1. Start talking with the child directly about pooping at school
2. Help them directly confront their fears about it
3. Have them "pretend" to poop - set them on the potty at home while you pretend to be the teacher or babysitter
4. This works better if the child actually needs to poop at that moment
5. If the child resists or cries, follow the Hand-in-Hand approach (allowing the child to express fears through crying)
6. Eventually the child will cry out their fears and successfully poop in the pretend game
7. This success will transfer to actual success at school/babysitter

**If the child does not express fears during pretend play**: This is less ideal because you do not know if they are actually working through anything. Continue pretending that the pooping at home is happening at school/babysitter, and maintain the game over time until they successfully poop. Eventually they will transfer this success to outside-the-home pottying.

## The Danger of Shaming

When parents get increasingly frustrated and engage in "shaming" conversations, the accidents typically increase rather than decrease. This is a predictable backfire.

In the case described, after two shaming conversations, accidents increased. The child who had only 1 accident at school every 10 days began having accidents at school for three consecutive days and had 4 total accidents in one day, including urinating on furniture for the first time.

**Why shaming backfires**: Toilet learning requires a relaxed body state. Shame creates tension and anxiety, which makes the physical process of proper elimination more difficult. It also damages the child's confidence and sense of competence, making them less likely to feel capable of success.

## Comparison Traps

Parents often become more frustrated when they perceive their child as behind their peers. However, the fact that other children "caught on faster" is not relevant to an individual child's developmental timeline.

While reassurance that "she won't walk down the aisle in a pull-up" can feel dismissive to a struggling parent, the underlying truth is important: all children get out of diapers eventually. The goal is to make the process as non-traumatic as possible.

## When to Seek Medical Evaluation

### Signs That Warrant Medical Investigation

- Leakage shortly after voiding (within 20 minutes)
- Consistently soaked diapers after naps/nighttime
- Pattern of holding poop
- Accidents worse later in the day
- Child cannot seem to control the leakage despite motivation

### Recommended Medical Approach

See a **pediatric gastroenterologist** (not just a regular pediatrician) for an x-ray of the child's colon to determine if they are backed up.

**What to tell the doctor**: The symptom is urine leakage, and the child won't poop unless a specific person is there, so they have gotten used to holding.

**Why this matters**: When children hold in their poop, internal organs can get distended and lose tone. The child sometimes stops feeling the signals that they need to go. Addressing this early prevents longer-term complications.

### If the Child Is Backed Up

The doctor may recommend a clean-out to get the colon emptied so it is no longer pressuring the bladder. After that, the focus shifts to ensuring the child poops every day without holding.

**The Soiling Solutions protocol** is recommended for children with fecal retention issues, particularly when constipation is involved.

## Action Plan (Sequence Matters)

The following steps should be taken in order because each one addresses a potential underlying cause:

### Step 1: Teach Proper Voiding Technique
Teach the child the four-step technique for complete bladder emptying, in case that is all they need.

### Step 2: Stop Worrying About the Leakage Itself
The child almost certainly cannot control the leakage because it is a bigger physical issue, probably caused by fecal retention. Address the root cause first. In the meantime, leave the child in diapers or pull-ups at naptime, nighttime, and as much as they will accept in the afternoons.

**Why this matters**: Removing the pressure to stay dry while addressing the underlying cause reduces shame and emotional stress for both parent and child.

### Step 3: Medical Evaluation
Take the child to a pediatric GI for an x-ray of their colon. If they are backed up, do a clean-out as recommended by the doctor.

### Step 4: Address Fears Through Play
Help the child move past their fears of pooping with anyone other than the primary caregiver by using play and pretend techniques.

### Expected Outcome
After completing these steps, when the child begins listening to their body to poop in the toilet at school and with other caregivers, the urine leakage issue will likely resolve on its own. The pressure on the bladder will be eliminated once the child is no longer holding poop.

## Key Warnings and Anti-Patterns

### What NOT to Do

- **Do not shame or express anger** about accidents - this will increase accidents
- **Do not compare to peers** - every child has their own timeline
- **Do not focus solely on the urine accidents** when the underlying issue may be fecal retention
- **Do not assume the child is being defiant or lazy** - they want to succeed
- **Do not dismiss medical causes** just because a pediatrician says it is "a process"
- **Do not make the play therapy heavy or serious** - keep it lighthearted and silly
- **Do not expect immediate results** - these approaches take time and consistency

### Common Mistakes

1. **Treating leakage as a behavioral issue** when it is actually physiological
2. **Pushing harder** when a child is not succeeding (this increases pressure and decreases success)
3. **Removing diapers/pull-ups prematurely** before the underlying issue is resolved
4. **Accepting a pediatrician's dismissal** without seeing a specialist who understands the poop-pee connection
5. **Focusing on rewards and motivation** when the problem is physical rather than motivational

## Understanding the Child's Experience

A child who is leaking despite recent toilet use, who can only poop with certain people, and who is experiencing shaming is working incredibly hard. They are exercising enormous control all day at school (hence fewer accidents there), exhausting themselves by afternoon, and then facing frustration and disappointment from caregivers despite their best efforts.

Recognizing this effort and redirecting focus to solving the underlying physical and emotional causes, rather than trying to increase motivation or willpower, is the path to success for both child and parent.
