# Understanding and Addressing Toddler Aggression (Pushing and Hitting)

## Core Reframe: Why Toddlers Are Not "Bullies"

An 18-month-old who pushes or hits other children is not a bully. The distinction matters because bullying requires intent to cause suffering, which toddlers lack. Here is what is actually happening:

**Toddlers are learning how to have an impact on the world.** This means they experiment with physical force to see what happens. When a physically strong toddler pushes another child and that child falls down, the toddler experiences this as exciting and powerful. From the toddler's perspective: "I can have such a big impact on the world!" This feeling of power is particularly meaningful for someone who normally feels pushed around by the world (being told what to do, physically moved by adults, etc.).

**They do not understand that it hurts.** Even if the other child cries, the toddler does not truly grasp that the other child has feelings. This is not because the child is bad - it is because empathy is not yet well-developed at 18 months. This is a developmental stage, not a character flaw.

**They are still learning the rules.** Little ones genuinely do not know that pushing is wrong in the way older children would understand it.

## Why Discipline Makes Aggression Worse

**Children learn both sides of every interaction.** When adults use physical force on children (including spanking, physical punishment, or forced time-outs), children learn two things:
1. Physical force is acceptable because grownups do it
2. Physical force is effective in getting what you want

**Time-outs are a form of using force.** When you physically make a child stay in one place, the child experiences this as being pushed around. Children who feel pushed around are more likely to push others around.

**The same mechanism that teaches aggression also teaches nurturing.** Children learn nurturing by being nurtured. This bidirectional learning applies to all interactions - children internalize both the giving and receiving sides of every exchange.

**Even unavoidable physical interventions contribute to this pattern.** Sometimes parents must physically move a toddler - out of danger, into a carseat when nothing else works. While these situations cannot always be avoided, they still contribute to the toddler feeling pushed around and wanting to exert power over others.

## The Underlying Mechanism: Emotional Dysregulation

**The child does care about parental approval** and does understand at some level that pushing is not okay. However, when experiencing big feelings, the toddler cannot regulate them. The behavior is not defiance or indifference - it is lack of impulse control.

**When a child is "under the influence" of big emotions,** they do not yet have enough frontal lobe development to control themselves. It looks to parents like they are not getting through, but the reality is developmental - the control circuitry is not yet built.

**The aggression often follows this sequence:**
1. Child is playing happily
2. Child becomes over-excited or uncomfortable
3. Low tolerance for frustration and poor impulse control mean the child cannot tolerate uncomfortable feelings
4. Child lashes out - pushing relieves the tension
5. Child does not register that this hurt the other child because empathy is underdeveloped

## Why Play Situations Trigger Aggression

**Play with other children is often overstimulating.** The child must simultaneously:
- Navigate social situations
- Compete for toys
- Handle the commotion and unpredictability
- Feel somewhat disconnected from their parent (even nearby)

**This creates measurable stress.** We know children get stressed in playgroup situations because their cortisol levels increase. This applies to one-on-one play as well, not just group situations.

**Stress and disconnection make children feel less safe, which increases likelihood of hitting.** The child who would not hit in a calm one-on-one moment with a parent becomes aggressive when stressed and feeling disconnected.

## Framework for Prevention and Response

### Prevention Strategy 1: Stay Physically Close

**Every time your son plays with another child for the next few months, stay right by his side.** This connection helps the child feel safer, which translates to feeling more relaxed and less threatened, which reduces aggressiveness.

**The proximity also enables protection.** If the child does lunge, you can immediately step between them and the other child. Both children need to know that you will protect the potential victim.

### Prevention Strategy 2: Preparation Through Verbal Preview

**Before playdates, describe what will happen in detail.** Example script: "When we get to Joshua's house, there will be two other boys there, named Michael and Devon. You and the other boys will all play together in the wading pool in the yard. Mommy will be right there if you need me. You can splash in the water and it will be a lot of fun, and we will all keep our hands on our own bodies. If you want a toy, you tell me and I will help you talk to whoever has the toy so you can have a turn with it. If you get mad, you tell me, and I will help you, ok? If you forget and push, we will need to stop having fun and leave right away. So let's remember to keep our hands on our own bodies and have fun with the other boys, ok?"

**Why this works:**
- Knowing what to expect makes the child feel safer
- Understanding that the parent will be available reduces anxiety
- Clear expectations are set before the emotionally charged moment
- The consequence (leaving) is explained calmly ahead of time

### Prevention Strategy 3: Limit Group Situations

**The child is not ready to play with other kids independently quite yet.** Accept this developmental reality rather than pushing against it.

**If group situations cannot be avoided, stay as close as possible.** Proximity is protective.

### Response Protocol When Aggression Occurs

**Step 1: Stay calm.** Take a deep breath. Your emotional regulation helps the child.

**Step 2: Remove the child from the situation immediately.** This serves multiple purposes:
- The child may need a break
- The child may need connection with you
- The child may be overstimulated and need to cry it out in your arms
- Removal protects the other child

**Step 3: If you are the only adult, tend to the other child first.** The other child's safety and comfort takes priority.

**Step 4: Hold your son while apologizing to the other child.** Model the apology: "(My son) is so sorry he hit you. He was mad and he forgot to use his words. We hope you feel better."

**Why holding during the apology matters:**
- Makes your son feel safer
- Helps him get his emotions back under control
- Creates receptive state where he can observe the modeled behavior

**Step 5: Explain calmly.** "Pushing hurts. We can't play with the other children when you push. Now we have to leave."

**Step 6: Leave immediately, no matter what.** The child will cry. This is expected and actually beneficial.

### Why This Response Pattern Is Not Punishment

**The child is hitting because he cannot handle the situation.** Putting him back in the situation would be:
- Wishful thinking (hoping he will suddenly be able to handle what he could not handle moments ago)
- Irresponsible to the other child (continuing to expose them to potential harm)

**Crying after removal is therapeutic.** It gives the child an opportunity to work through all the feelings that caused the hitting in the first place.

**The child has already experienced natural consequences.** He cannot play anymore. Additional reprimand is unnecessary and counterproductive.

### What to Say After (Empathy + Faith)

**Acknowledge the feelings:** "You are so sad and mad that we have to leave."

**Explain the boundary again:** "But when you push, it hurts, and we can't play with the other children."

**Acknowledge the difficulty:** "I know that you got really upset. It's hard when you're little."

**Offer alternative strategies for next time:** "Next time maybe you can use your words, or get me to help."

**Express faith in their development:** "But you're getting bigger all the time. Soon you'll remember."

**Affirm that the child is not bad:** The child needs to hear that they are not bad, just little, and that you have faith in their ability to master this developmental challenge.

## Daily Practices That Reduce Aggression

### The "Pushing Game"

**How to play:** Say "Let's play the pushing game. You can't push other kids, but you can push Mommy. Pushing doesn't hurt Mommy." Let the child push against you hard. Let them push you and you fall down. Make it very silly. The child will laugh happily.

**Keep going as long as you can stand it.** The child will probably love this game and want to play it repeatedly. That desire to repeat it is a sign that it is helping them work something out.

**Why this works:** The child gets to experiment with force, power, and their desire to push in a safe context. This satisfies the developmental need to explore physical power without anyone getting hurt.

**Expected duration:** Possibly once a day for a couple of months until the child loses interest.

### Honoring Feelings Constantly

**This builds emotional intelligence necessary to manage feelings.** Honoring feelings does not mean agreeing or removing limits. It means acknowledging feelings and offering empathy.

**Example script when child wants candy before dinner:** "You wish you could have that candy. It's almost dinner time, so no candy. I know that makes you sad. You can have some carrots if you're hungry, and I can give you a hug to make you feel better. We can snuggle on the couch and read your book. I see you're too sad and mad to read right now, you want that candy so much you're crying. It's hard to be so sad and mad. When you're ready I'll hold you and give you a big hug."

**The structure:** Acknowledge the desire -> State the limit -> Acknowledge the feeling about the limit -> Offer alternatives -> Stay present through the emotion.

### Building Empathy Actively

**The reason we do not hit others is that we feel for them.** Empathy is the underlying capacity that makes non-aggression natural rather than forced.

**First method: Empathize with your child.** This teaches empathy by modeling it and by letting them experience what it feels like to be understood.

**Second method: Demonstrate empathy for others throughout daily life.** Draw attention to others' emotions:
- "Look, that little girl is crying in her stroller. I wonder why she's so sad?"
- "Oh oh, Robbie fell down and got hurt. Ouch, that must hurt. Do you think it would cheer him up if we offered him a hug?"
- "Kaylee sure is mad. She doesn't want to go home, does she?"

### Teaching Emotional Expression Tools

**Teach these during calm moments, then remind during upset moments.**

**Mad faces:** "Let's make mad faces. Then you can show me when you're mad." Later in stressful situations: "Wow, are you mad. Show me how mad you are with your mad face."

**Squeeze ball:** Give the child a squeeze ball and tell them to fill it up with their mad feelings.

**Calming breath technique:** Breathe in deeply through the nose, hold it a moment, let it out very slowly through a small hole in the lips. Have the child blow on their hand to feel the breath. Teach this when calm, then cue it when frustrated: "Let's take a calming breath."

**The teaching sequence is critical:** The tools must be learned and practiced during good moments. Only then can they be accessed during stress. You will be amazed when you see the child actually try one of these techniques under stress.

### Connecting Aggression to Underlying Feelings

**Help the child make the connection between feelings and actions.** If you do not know what triggered the aggression, you can say: "You pushed your friend. Were you upset?"

**This builds the pathway from feeling to words rather than feeling to action.** Soon the child will learn to say they are upset when they have that feeling, which is the first step in learning to manage the feeling without acting on it.

## Communication With Other Parents

**Be proactive and direct with other parents in playgroup situations.** Example: "My son is going through a stage where he gets aggressive and pushes other kids, and I am trying to nip it in the bud by staying next to him. I hope you won't think I'm rude, but today I need to really focus on him. I look forward to catching up with you next time."

**Accept that you will get virtually no adult interaction during this phase.** Find other ways to connect with other adults while the child is in this phase.

**The phase will not last.** This is a developmental stage, not a permanent characteristic.

## The Bigger Picture: What This Phase Develops

**This phase is an opportunity to build emotional intelligence (EQ).** While holding a melting-down toddler after an incident, remember that you are fostering high EQ that will be an asset for the rest of the child's life.

**The skills being built:**
- Empathy (by receiving empathy and by observing empathy for others)
- Emotional regulation (by having emotions co-regulated with a calm adult)
- Alternative expression of feelings (through taught techniques)
- Understanding cause and effect in relationships (through consistent, calm responses)
- Trust that feelings can be managed (by experiencing successful regulation)

**The behavior will stop.** This is a phase that toddlers go through. It is nerve-wracking and embarrassing for parents, but it is completely normal and the child will certainly outgrow it.
