# Handling Hitting and Aggressive Behavior Between Toddlers and Preschoolers

## Understanding Why Aggressive Behavior is Developmentally Normal

**Virtually all three year olds go through a bossy phase.** This is not a sign of a problem child but a developmental stage. Similarly, most toddlers go through a brief biting or hitting phase that typically ends after a few incidents when parents express their shock and dismay.

Two and three year olds are still figuring out what is socially acceptable behavior. The learning process involves several developmental tasks happening simultaneously:

1. **Learning that abusing power costs more than it gains** - It takes a long time for humans to learn that using power over others (including the natural power differential between a 3-year-old and a 2-year-old) loses them more important things, including friendship. This is not intuitive for young children.

2. **Reconciling empathy with desire** - Three year olds are just beginning to reconcile their natural empathy for others with their desire to get what they want. These two drives are in genuine conflict at this age.

3. **Developing impulse control** - The impulse control that will help children grow out of aggressiveness is only just beginning to develop at age 3. The hardware simply isn't there yet.

## Why Timeouts Backfire for Hitting Behavior

Research shows that **timeouts do not effectively prevent hitting**. Timeouts backfire with kids for two specific reasons:

**Reason 1: The power reaction effect** - Two and three year olds love to experience their sense of power and agency in the world. When a child hits and receives a timeout, they learn they can get a big reaction from the grownup. This actually reinforces the behavior by satisfying their desire for impact and power. The child thinks "Look how much I made happen!" and repeats the misbehavior.

**Reason 2: The relationship damage effect** - Timeouts set up a power struggle and undermine the adult's relationship with the child. When the relationship is damaged, children are less likely to want to please the adult. Children who feel disconnected from adults are more likely to repeat misbehavior because they have less motivation to cooperate and less felt sense of being on the same team.

## Environmental Factors That Increase Hitting

Research identifies several factors that make hitting more likely:

**Spanking at home** - Research shows that children who are spanked by their parents are much more likely to hit other children. If spanking is a discipline strategy in the household, it directly models and normalizes hitting as a problem-solving tool.

**Witnessing any hitting** - If a child sees anyone else hit, it becomes harder to eliminate the hitting habit. The child has been shown that hitting is something people do.

**Violent TV including cartoons** - Research shows that kids who see any kind of hitting on TV, including cartoon hitting, are more likely to hit others. Eliminating violent TV entirely is important for reducing hitting behavior.

## The Most Effective Strategy to Stop Hitting

### Prevention Through Active Presence

**Be present during playtime.** Hitting occurs when a three year old is frustrated and sees hitting as the way to solve a problem. If an adult is there, they can see the problem brewing and facilitate a more socially competent way to resolve the problem. The adult can:
- Give the children language to express themselves verbally
- Offer solutions like taking turns
- Step in before frustration escalates to physical aggression

**Most two and three year olds are simply not socially developed enough to play without supervision for long.** This is not a failing of the child but a developmental reality. Expecting unsupervised peaceful play is expecting something children this age are not yet capable of consistently providing.

### Response Sequence When Hitting Occurs

The order of response matters enormously because attention is a powerful reinforcer:

**Step 1: Tend to the victim first.** Sweep in and tend to the child who has been hit. If the attention goes to the hitter, even negative attention, the hitting is more likely to recur. If the hitter is initially ignored while attention is showered on the child who has been hit, the hitting is less likely to recur. This works because the hitter sees that hitting doesn't get them the attention they wanted, and the social reward goes to the victim.

**Step 2: Stay calm.** Angry responses from adults provoke more anger from children. Hysterical responses provoke more hysteria. The adult's emotional regulation sets the tone and models the expected behavior.

**Step 3: Address the hitter once the victim is settled.** Once the child who has been hit is calm, put them down with a drink of water or a stuffed animal, and then turn attention to the hitter.

**Step 4: Deliver the message calmly and clearly.** Stay calm while saying: "The rule is no hitting, no matter what. Hitting hurts. Did you see how your friend was crying? I know you were angry, but we don't hit. You can call me if you need me to help, but you can't hit. Because you hit, playtime is over."

This script accomplishes several things:
- States the rule clearly and absolutely
- Connects the action to the consequence for the other child (empathy building)
- Validates the emotion while rejecting the behavior
- Offers an alternative (calling for help)
- Delivers a meaningful consequence

### The Consequence: End the Playdate

**End the playdate when hitting occurs.** A timeout is insufficient to teach the lesson needed here. If hitting is followed by an immediate separation that lasts all day and maybe longer, the child learns that hitting means losing the company of their friend.

This is a natural consequence that teaches cause and effect at a level the child can understand: "When I hit my friend, I lose my friend." The loss of the desired relationship is far more impactful than a few minutes sitting in a corner.

**Practical consideration:** If the arrangement is babysitting-trade and ending the playdate isn't possible during the week, engineer a weekend playdate specifically so you can follow through with this consequence when needed. The ability to end the interaction is essential to making the consequence meaningful.

## Building Empathy as a Long-Term Prevention Strategy

**Work together with the other parent to help the child develop empathy.** Point out to the child: "Did you see how your friend was crying? Hitting hurts."

### Why Forced Apologies Can Backfire

Apologies, which feel like punishment to kids, can backfire. Children experience being made to apologize as a form of punishment, not as genuine relationship repair. This associates apologizing with feeling bad rather than with caring about others.

### What Works Better Than Apologies

It's most effective to help the child empathize and take reparative action. Encourage the child who hit to make the victim feel better by:
- Bringing the victim's blanket
- Bringing ice
- Bringing a toy

This teaches that when you hurt someone, you help them feel better. It channels the child's energy into caring action rather than hollow words.

### Building Empathy Throughout Daily Life

Be alert for every other opportunity to empathize with both children. **Receiving empathy from adults is what develops kids' ability to empathize with others.** Children learn empathy by being shown empathy. This is what will ultimately prevent the child from doing harm to their friend, because they will genuinely care about their friend's wellbeing.

## The Power of Positive Expectations

**Have confidence in the child to change.** The child isn't bad, just three years old. Praise the child when they handle themselves well.

**Warning: Negative expectations become self-fulfilling.** If you feel negatively toward the child, that will communicate itself, and the child is more likely to act badly. Children pick up on adult attitudes and often live up (or down) to expectations. A child who senses they are viewed as "the bad kid" has less motivation to try to be good.

## Framework for Evaluating When the Situation is Beneficial vs. Harmful

The question of whether to continue the friendship depends entirely on what the child is learning from the experience. There are two very different outcomes:

### Harmful Learning (Protect the Child)

If the child is learning that someone else has the right to bully her and no one will defend her, then protection from the situation is needed. This happens when:
- Adult intervention is absent or inadequate
- The child feels alone in dealing with aggression
- The child is developing a sense of helplessness or that she deserves poor treatment

### Beneficial Learning (Continue with Good Supervision)

If the child is learning the following, then she is learning something invaluable about human relationships:
- Sometimes friends are difficult, bossy, and possessive
- She can stand up for herself
- She can summon helpful adult intervention when necessary
- She can navigate such an encounter
- At other times she can enjoy the friendship

**The determining factor is the quality of the adult supervision and intervention.** Toddlers need an adult nearby to intervene and teach social skills, because every toddler is sometimes grabby and possessive with toys.

### The Key Questions to Ask

1. Is the child physically safe? Is intervention quick enough to prevent real harm? Is supervision adequate to prevent harm?
2. Can adults be available and attentive in the same room when the children play, at least for now?
3. Is there confidence that the other parent will provide this level of supervision when you're not there?

## Separating Parent Issues from Child Needs

Parents must examine their own motivations when deciding how to handle these situations:

**The overprotective pull:** A parent who was bullied as a child may be over-reacting because of their own past trauma. Their alarm level may not match the actual situation their child is experiencing.

**The minimizing pull:** A parent may be minimizing their child's distress because:
- They don't want to give up a convenient babysitting arrangement
- They have a relationship with the neighbors they want to preserve
- They are conflict-averse

**The child's actual experience matters most.** The child might experience the end of the friendship as a tremendous loss and might have learned a great deal from the experience. Or the child might be suffering and need protection.

**Parents can only make the right judgment if they set aside their own issues** and look clearly at what their child is actually experiencing. This requires honest self-examination about why each parent holds the position they hold.
