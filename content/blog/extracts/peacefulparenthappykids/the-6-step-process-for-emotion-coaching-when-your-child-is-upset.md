## Core Philosophy: Why Emotion Coaching Matters

**Emotions are not dangerous.** The only way to resolve emotions is to go through them, not around them or away from them. When a child experiences big emotions, this represents an important learning opportunity rather than a problem to eliminate.

Most parents instinctively want to make their child's emotions go away as quickly as possible. If the child is angry at the parent, the parent feels defensive and views the child's feelings as unwarranted. If the child is upset about something else, the parent wants to fix it and make them feel better. Both responses miss the point.

**Supporting a child through emotions means coaching them to be aware of their feelings and to accept them.** This awareness and acceptance is the first step toward learning to express emotions responsibly. The goal is not to suppress or rush through feelings but to help children develop a healthy relationship with their emotional experiences.

## Step 1: Calm Yourself First

The parent's emotional state sets the stage for everything that follows. An escalated parent cannot de-escalate a child.

### The Pause Button Technique

**Stop, drop your agenda (just for now), and take a deep breath before engaging with your child.** The phrase "just for now" is important because it acknowledges that your agenda still matters, but this moment requires presence.

### Reframing the Situation

Remind yourself that **your goal is to calm the storm for your child, not escalate it.** This reframe shifts from reactive mode to intentional support mode.

**Don't take your child's emotions personally.** Even if your child is screaming "I hate you!", this is not about you. This is about your child: their tangled-up feelings and still-developing brain. The developing brain piece is crucial because it explains why children express emotions in ways that seem disproportionate or irrational to adults.

### Calming Mantras

Use a mantra to regulate your own nervous system:
- "It's not an emergency"
- "This is an opportunity to be there for my child when he's upset"

These mantras work because they directly counter the fight-or-flight response that big emotions often trigger in parents.

### Body Awareness

**Notice the sensations in your own body so that you're aware of what you're feeling.** This awareness serves two purposes: it helps you regulate yourself, and it models the emotional awareness you're trying to teach your child.

**Notice if you feel annoyance or the urge to make your child's feelings go away.** Recognizing these impulses without acting on them is key. Then consciously decide that your goal is to use this opportunity to build a closer relationship with your child and teach them helpful lessons about accepting and responding to emotions.

## Step 2: Connect to Create Safety

### Why Safety Matters for Emotional Processing

**Your child needs to let themselves feel those big emotions instead of stuffing them. That's how emotions begin to heal.** Stuffed emotions don't disappear; they get stored and emerge later, often in destructive ways.

Your job is to help your child feel safe so they can let themselves feel deeply. This is counterintuitive for many parents who think their job is to stop the feelings or solve the problem.

### How to Create Safety

**Reach out to connect emotionally, and if you can, physically.** Physical touch activates the calming parasympathetic nervous system.

**Create safety with your touch, your warmth, your tone, your attitude.** These nonverbal elements often communicate more than words.

**Give your child the verbal and/or nonverbal message:** "I will help you... You're safe... You can handle this." The "you can handle this" piece is important because it communicates confidence in your child's capacity while also offering support.

### Co-Regulation Through Breathing

**If you breathe slowly and deeply, your child will usually begin to breathe more slowly.** This is co-regulation in action. Children's nervous systems attune to the adults around them, so a calm parent literally helps regulate a child's physiology.

## Step 3: Validate and Empathize

### Why Empathy Creates Safety

**Your empathy creates safety by helping your child feel understood.** When children feel that someone truly understands how upset they are, two things happen: they can let themselves feel the emotions (instead of suppressing them), and they don't need to escalate to be heard.

### Important Distinction: Validation vs. Agreement

**Validation doesn't necessarily mean you agree, only that you understand why your child would feel this way.** This distinction is critical because parents often resist validating feelings they think are "wrong" or disproportionate. You can validate the experience without endorsing the reaction.

### Technique: Match Your Child's Tone

When reflecting emotions, match your child's intensity. A mellow "you seem upset" in response to a raging child will feel dismissive. Mirroring shows you actually get it.

### Specific Approaches for Different Situations

**When a child seems worried or upset about something:**
- "You seem a little worried about this sleepover"
- "You look so mad!"

**When a child is describing a problem:**
Repeat back what you've heard: "I hear you loud and clear. You're fed up with your brother going into your room and taking your gum."

**When a child is expressing anger at you:**
Resist the urge to tell them to be appropriate. Instead, acknowledge the feelings and invite them to explain: "You must be so upset to talk to me that way, Amelia. We can make this better. Let's start over. I'm listening."

**When you don't know what your child is feeling or when naming emotions makes them angry:**
"Upset" is a good all-purpose word that doesn't feel like labeling: "I hear how upset you are about this."

**When words feel presumptuous:**
Describe what you observe physically: "I see you're biting your lip. You look worried." Or to avoid naming emotions entirely: "Your arms are crossed over your chest like this, and your brows are tight, like this. I wonder what's going on?"

**Acknowledging perspective without solving:**
- "You wish that..."
- "This isn't what you wanted..."

**When a child is crying:**
Words can be a distraction during tears. Use them sparingly to create safety and welcome the emotion: "Everybody needs to cry sometimes. It's good to feel those tears and let them go. I'm right here. You're safe."

## Step 4: Double-Check Understanding

### Why This Step Exists

You don't have to worry about whether you were able to accurately reflect your child's feelings. Just ask. This takes the pressure off getting it "right" and invites collaboration.

### How to Check

- "Did I get that right?"
- "Is that what you're telling me?"

### Responding to Their Response

**If they agree:** Your child may say "Of course I'm mad!" and elaborate further. The confirmation opens the door to deeper sharing.

**If they correct you gently:** "I'm not disappointed! I'm mad!" In this case, try again. If possible, use your child's exact words so they know you're listening: "I'm sorry, Caleb. I see now how mad you are. Tell me more about why."

**If they correct you defensively:** If your child says "I'm NOT MAD!" even though it's clear that you were accurate, this is a signal that your child is feeling judged or analyzed rather than understood. Acknowledge the correction and start over, connecting more as you describe the child's perspective: "I hear you, Lucas. You're not mad. Let me see if I understand. You wanted X. Is that right?"

### Critical Warning

**Don't fight about what your child is actually feeling.** What's important is that they feel that you're on their side, trying to understand. Their awareness of what they're feeling will shift as they move through the emotions. The feeling is a moving target, and the connection matters more than perfect accuracy.

## Step 5: Deepen the Conversation

### The Goal

**Your goal is for your child to feel less alone with these big feelings, which reduces the overwhelm, shame, and fear.** Loneliness amplifies difficult emotions. Connection reduces their power.

You do this by offering support, validating your child's emotion, and inviting your child to tell you more. This isn't just about the words you use but about the emotional tone or resonance. The how matters as much as the what.

### Phrases That Deepen Connection

- "Ouch, that must have hurt!"
- "Oh, Sofia, no wonder you're upset."
- "It could be really embarrassing, to have your teacher say that."
- "You're saying that I love your sister more... Ethan, that must feel so awful, to feel that..."
- "I didn't understand how important this was to you. Tell me more."
- "I hear how angry you are about this. What can I do to help make this better?"

### The "Anything Else?" Technique

**"So I hear you're upset because of X and also Y! Is there anything else?"**

Asking if there's anything else often opens the floodgates to get to the heart of why your child is upset. They may start with what a lousy mother you are for making oatmeal again, and end up telling you that they think you love their brother more, or that they're being bullied at school. The presenting problem is often not the real problem.

### When Your Child Is Angry at You

**"Thank you for telling me this. I'm sorry that what I did upset you so much. Please tell me more."**

When your child is angry at you, let them know you're listening. You may find out something that will transform your relationship for the better. Or you may find that their anger has nothing to do with you after all.

### The Story-Telling Technique

**Describe the incident without judging, so your child feels understood:** "Lena wanted to play with your doll and you were worried. You said 'No!' You hit Lena and you both cried. Right?"

Telling the story helps the child calm down, reflect, and integrate the emotions because the emotional experience that was processed by the right frontal lobe is articulated and understood by the verbal, more rational left frontal lobe. This is neural integration in action, where putting words to emotions helps regulate them.

### Feeling With Your Child

**Let yourself feel some of what your child is feeling, while you still stay centered.** If you really feel the emotion with your child, then you may get tears in your eyes at how heartbreaking this must be for them. This increases the connection between you and helps your child trust you.

The balance is crucial: feel with them while staying centered. If you lose your center, you can't support them.

## Step 6: Support Problem-Solving

### Timing Is Everything

**Don't initiate this last step until your child is calm and ready.** Jumping to problem-solving before emotions have been processed will backfire because the child isn't cognitively available for logical thinking.

Most of the time, when kids (and adults) feel their emotions are understood and accepted, the feelings lose their charge and begin to dissipate. This creates an opening for problem-solving. The emotional work must come first.

### How to Initiate

You might say something like: "This is a tough problem. I wonder what you could do now to make things better?"

### Why Not to Give Solutions

**Resist the urge to tell them what to do to solve the problem; that gives your child the message that you don't have confidence in their ability to handle it.** If your child feels stuck, help them brainstorm and explore options rather than providing answers.

### Guiding Without Directing

If they suggest a solution that you think would lead to more problems, use curiosity rather than correction: "Hmmm... So you think you might do X. I wonder what would happen then?" This lets them think through consequences themselves.

### When You're Part of the Problem

If you were part of the "problem" your child was upset about, feel free to suggest a solution: "I know it's disappointing that we can't practice your jump shot tonight because of my meeting. How about we make a deal to spend all morning on Saturday working on it?"

### Diagnostic Signal

**If your child still seems upset and negative and isn't open to problem-solving, that's a sign that they haven't worked through the emotions yet and you need to go back to the earlier steps.** Resistance to problem-solving means the emotional work isn't complete.

## What to Expect Over Time

### Short-Term Investment, Long-Term Gains

Time consuming? Yes. But as you get more comfortable, you'll move through the steps quickly.

### Benefits of Consistent Emotion Coaching

- Your child gets better at expressing emotions in a constructive way
- **Emotion coaching raises kids who are more emotionally intelligent and better at regulating their emotions**
- It helps the parent stay calm when the child is upset, creating a more peaceful household

**The result: Less drama, more solutions. And a lot more love.**

## Common Parental Patterns to Watch For

The opening quote identifies a common dynamic: "I was sent to my room as a child when I got emotional, so I always get upset myself when my son is upset, and then I make everything worse."

This illustrates how parents' own childhood experiences with emotions shape their responses to their children's emotions. A parent who was isolated or punished for emotions may feel triggered when their child has big feelings, leading them to react in unhelpful ways. Awareness of this pattern is the first step to changing it.
