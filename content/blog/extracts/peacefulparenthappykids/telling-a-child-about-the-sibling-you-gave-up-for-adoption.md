# Telling a Child About a Sibling Given Up for Adoption

## Core Principle: Early, Gradual Disclosure Over Sudden Revelation

The fundamental approach is to make the adoption part of the family narrative from the beginning rather than revealing it as a surprise later. The reasoning behind this is that children process information better when it is woven into their ongoing understanding of family rather than presented as a sudden disclosure that disrupts their worldview.

**Timing paradox**: The parent in this case wanted to wait until age 5, but Dr. Laura points out that waiting actually makes the disclosure MORE traumatic, not less, because it becomes a bigger surprise. The longer you wait, the more the child has built up a stable picture of their family that then gets disrupted.

## Age-Specific Concern: The Three-Year-Old's Fear of Abandonment

When dealing with a three-year-old specifically, there is a critical concern: **the child may worry that they too could be given away**. This is a developmental reality of how young children think. They are egocentric and will naturally wonder "could this happen to me?" when hearing that a sibling was placed for adoption.

This concern must be addressed directly in how the story is framed.

## The Storybook Method

Dr. Laura recommends creating a **personalized storybook** as the vehicle for this conversation. The storybook approach serves multiple purposes:

1. It creates a narrative structure that children can understand and return to repeatedly
2. It allows the parent to control the framing and emphasize key reassuring elements
3. It becomes a reference point for ongoing conversations rather than a one-time difficult talk
4. The physical book makes the topic approachable and normalized rather than taboo

### Story Structure Elements

The recommended narrative arc includes these specific components:

**Opening context**: Begin with the parent as a character ("Once upon a time, there was a girl named Susan"). This frames the parent as someone with a history and journey, not just "Mom" in her current role.

**Life circumstances**: Include age-appropriate examples of how life was "good in some ways but hard in some ways." This establishes that the decision happened in a specific context of difficulty, not randomly or because of anything about the baby.

**The decision point**: "When her baby girl was born, Susan did not feel ready to be a mommy." The key phrase here is "not ready" - this frames the adoption as about timing and circumstances, not about the baby being unwanted or unloved.

**The adoption itself**: "She found a family that wanted a child, and they adopted the baby." This emphasizes that there was a receiving family who wanted the child.

**Emotional acknowledgment**: "Susan was very sad and missed her baby." It is important not to skip the sadness. Children need to know that the parent had feelings about this, and that giving a child up for adoption was emotionally significant.

**Positive framing of outcome**: "She knew that the little girl was growing up with a family that loved her and could take care of her." This reassures that the child in the adoption was cared for and loved.

**Hope for the future**: "She hoped that some day when she was ready to be a mother and raise a child, she would have a baby who she could raise." This sets up the arc toward the current child.

**Changed circumstances**: "Finally, life was very different..." with specifics about job, house, partner, or whatever is true. This establishes that the situation that led to the adoption decision no longer exists.

**The current child's arrival**: Describe the joy and readiness when the current child was born.

**The critical reassurance for the listening child**: "I am your mother forever and ever and I will always be here for you. We are a forever family." The term **"forever family"** directly addresses the three-year-old's potential fear of abandonment. The repetition of "forever" emphasizes permanence.

### What to Be Specific About

The instruction to "be specific" appears twice in the recommended script:
- When describing what made life hard (age-appropriate examples)
- When describing changed circumstances (job, house, partner)

Specificity matters because vague statements can feel dismissive or incomplete to children. Concrete details make the story feel real and trustworthy.

## Handling Questions About the Biological Sibling

Once the book is being read regularly, the child will likely have questions about the girl in the story. Dr. Laura provides example responses:

- "She has new parents" - straightforward fact
- "She is grown up now" - age-appropriate update
- "If she wants to meet us, she will reach out" - this puts the ball in the adult sibling's court without closing the door
- "Maybe some day we will get to meet her" - maintains openness to future connection

## Background Context: The Adopted Child's Response

The parent mentioned that she reached out to her biological daughter at age 18, and the daughter said she did not want contact. Dr. Laura does not directly address this rejection, but the parent wisely notes that the daughter "was just 18 and...that decision may change." This acknowledges that initial rejection is not necessarily permanent.

The parent's approach of telling her son early also serves a practical purpose: "the less likely he is to have a large negative emotional reaction either of his own or as a reflection of close family and friends cluing in to some imagined scandal." By making this normal family knowledge rather than a secret, it reduces the risk of the child learning about it through others in a way that feels shameful or shocking.

## Unique Insight: Highly Sensitive Children

The parent notes that her son is "very sensitive to the emotions of people around him, at a remarkable level." This increases the importance of the parent processing their own emotions around this topic, because the child will pick up on parental discomfort or shame. The storybook method may help the parent practice telling the story until they can do so with calm acceptance rather than distress.

## What This Approach Avoids

- **Secrecy**: Secrets in families tend to create shame and anxiety
- **Sudden revelation**: The "sit down, I have something to tell you" approach creates a before/after divide in the child's understanding
- **Age-inappropriate detail**: The storybook format naturally constrains what is shared to what a young child can process
- **Abandonment fears**: The "forever family" framing directly counters the child's natural worry
