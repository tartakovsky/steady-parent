## The Core Phenomenon: Aggression Following Connection

When a child lashes out (hitting, crying) immediately after a warm, snuggly, or playful interaction with a parent, this is not a failure of the connection - it is a direct result of it. The closeness itself triggers the release of stored emotions.

**Why closeness brings up pain rather than just happiness**: Before the warm interaction, the child may have experienced difficult feelings (jealousy, anger, sadness, fear) that they didn't feel comfortable expressing at the time. These feelings got suppressed. When the parent initiates closeness, it's like finally receiving what the child has been longing for. This brings up all their pent-up need for connection - but those suppressed angry, sad, or scared feelings are blocking the way. The child needs to release those feelings before they can fully accept the love being offered.

## The Emotional Backpack Model

**What it is**: Every person has an "emotional backpack," which is essentially the unconscious (also described as "the body"). When we can't process a big feeling in the moment, we stuff it in the emotional backpack and carry it around until we find a safe opportunity to work through it.

**How emotions get resolved**: Once we allow ourselves to fully feel those stored-up emotions, their message is delivered, and they melt away. The key is that the emotions must be felt, not just acknowledged intellectually.

**The disconnect effect**: While a child is struggling with a full emotional backpack, these painful emotions disconnect them from their parent. They can't take in the love being offered. This causes them to become difficult and contrary, because they're actually miserable inside.

## Why This Matters: The Case Study

A 4-year-old boy who "often seems angry since his brother was born" was snuggled by his mother (Katie). Here's the sequence of what happened:

1. **Underlying emotional state**: Inside, he was feeling sad and alone, worried about whether his mom still loves him. This worry came from the new sibling situation.

2. **Initial response to connection**: He loved the snuggling and giggling. The positive interaction was genuinely enjoyable.

3. **The trigger point**: By restoring that loving connection, Katie helped her son feel safe enough to show her the upset feelings he's been struggling with since his brother was born. The safety of the connection gave him permission to let the feelings out.

4. **How the feelings emerged**: Unfortunately, he showed those feelings by hitting her. Hitting was the vehicle for the emotion, not the emotion itself.

5. **The parent's critical response**: Katie stayed calm. She didn't yell or punish. She stopped her son from hitting physically. She acknowledged his anger verbally.

6. **Going beneath the surface anger**: Katie's understanding helped her son feel safe enough to go under the anger to the sadness and fear that were causing the anger. Anger was the top layer; sadness and fear were underneath.

7. **The release**: He cried, showing his mom the depth of his pain. This crying was the actual emotional processing.

## What Love Actually Means in This Context

Love isn't just about those warm, snuggly moments. Love is also sitting with your child while they share their deep despair. Love accepts the child, difficult emotions and all. Love heals.

The healing comes not from the pleasant moments but from the acceptance during the difficult ones.

## Practical Response When Your Child Hits After Closeness

**The action is unacceptable, not the feeling.** This distinction is critical. You can and should stop the hitting while still accepting the emotion driving it.

### What Katie Did Right

- Did not push her son away
- Did not shut down his feelings
- Set a limit: "I won't let you hit me"
- Reconnected immediately by holding his hand
- Acknowledged his feelings: "I see you're mad"
- This empathy helped him feel safe enough to cry

### Suggested Script

Say with understanding: "Ouch! All of a sudden you seem very angry. I won't let you hurt me, but you can show me how mad you are by pushing my hands... and you can tell me in words. I'm listening."

**Why "pushing my hands" works**: This gives the child a physical outlet for the emotion that doesn't hurt anyone. Children often need a physical way to express big feelings.

### What to Do After Setting the Limit

Then just listen, whether your child is using words, tears, or pushing to express their feelings. The child may well want to struggle against you, which helps kids get past the anger to the fear beneath.

**On parental emotional resonance**: If you can stay compassionate and really feel it from your child's perspective, you'll probably tear up yourself. This is actually a good thing - your emotional resonance with what they're feeling makes it safer for your child to cry and feel those uncomfortable emotions. That shared emotional state is where the real healing comes.

## The Outcome: What Happens After the Emotional Release

After Katie's son cried:

- He felt much happier and more cooperative
- Their relationship became closer
- He didn't feel as much resentment toward the baby
- He was more cooperative with his mom
- He was ready for the loving snuggle that started the whole process

The emotional release removes the block that was preventing connection in the first place.

## Connection Time as a Diagnostic and Healing Tool

**One of the great benefits of connection time**: The child starts to reconnect with the parent at a deeper level. They show what's happening internally and ask for help to work it through.

**Three ways children might process during connection time**:

1. **Through play** - Working out the tension through playful interaction
2. **Through talking** - Beginning to talk about the upset, which gives the parent a chance to empathize and express sorrow that it's been so hard
3. **Through hitting or physical expression** - Showing feelings through action (unacceptable behavior that requires limits, but the feeling behind it should be accepted)

## Key Insight: The Layering of Emotions

Anger typically sits on top of sadness and fear. When a child is supported through their anger without being punished or rejected, they can access the deeper emotions underneath. The anger is often a protective layer or a more "acceptable" way to express the more vulnerable feelings of sadness and fear.

This is why acknowledging the anger ("I see you're mad") while staying connected helps the child eventually cry - the crying represents accessing the deeper layer of emotion.
