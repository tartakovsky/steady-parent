# Third Trimester Preparation Guide

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids - Third Trimester

## Overview and Priorities

The third trimester is characterized as the "home stretch" of pregnancy, requiring preparation across multiple domains simultaneously. During this period, parents should continue established healthy habits (eating well, sleeping adequately, moderate exercise, self-care, partner bonding) while adding specific preparation for birth and the postpartum period.

The core priorities during this trimester fall into seven categories: birth education, birth planning, partner alignment on parenting philosophy, postpartum support planning, hospital preparation, essential shopping, and breastfeeding preparation.

## Birth Education

### The Value of Childbirth Classes

**Knowledge is framed as power** in the birth context. The explicit goal of childbirth education is to prepare parents to confidently make the best informed decisions possible, regardless of how circumstances unfold. This framing emphasizes decision-making capacity over following a predetermined script.

### Choosing the Right Class

**Avoid hospital-based classes** - the reasoning given is that hospital classes generally emphasize institutional routines rather than parental options. This distinction matters because routine-focused education may not prepare parents for situations where they want to deviate from standard protocols.

**Use peer recommendations** - talk to other women who have taken specific classes. The key questions to ask are: Was it helpful? Why was it helpful? This helps identify classes that genuinely prepare parents versus those that are merely informational.

**The class should accomplish two things:**
1. Help clarify your desires for the birth process
2. Help you prepare yourself to achieve those desires

### Timing Consideration

Schedule classes to end a couple of weeks before your due date. The reasoning is that babies sometimes arrive early, and you want to complete your education before labor begins rather than missing the final sessions.

## Birth Planning

### The Philosophy Behind Birth Plans

The author acknowledges upfront that birth rarely unfolds according to plan because "life doesn't, and your baby has her own plan." Despite this unpredictability, birth plans remain valuable for two reasons:

1. **Directional clarity** - "If you don't know where you're headed you'll end up somewhere else." Without articulating what you want, you're more likely to end up with whatever happens by default.

2. **Intention has influence** - The author suggests that "your intention counts for at least something in the way things manifest." While not guaranteeing outcomes, having clear intentions shapes how you navigate decision points.

### What Birth Plans Provide

At minimum, creating a birth plan gives you clarity on your ideal situation, which increases the chances of welcoming your baby as you'd like to, even if the exact plan doesn't unfold.

## Partner Alignment on Parenting Philosophy

### Why This Conversation Matters

If you intend to make specific parenting choices like co-sleeping or breastfeeding on demand, your partner needs to understand why you're making those choices. The reason is practical: you will need their support to sustain these choices, especially during difficult moments. A partner who doesn't understand the reasoning behind a choice may inadvertently undermine it or fail to provide necessary support.

### When to Start

This conversation should begin during the third trimester "if you haven't already." The implication is that earlier is better, but third trimester is the deadline for having this alignment in place before the baby arrives.

## Postpartum Support Planning

### Reframing the First Week

**Plan to be in bed nursing or sleeping 24/7 for the first week.** This is the baseline assumption for planning. The purpose of this intensive period is threefold:
1. Bond with your baby
2. Learn how to feed your baby
3. Learn how to comfort your baby

### What Kind of Help You Actually Need

**A reassuring grandma** is fine to soothe a crying baby when you're at your wit's end. However, the author explicitly states **you don't need a baby nurse.**

**What you do need:** Someone who can nurture and feed you, do your dishes, and run to the store. The framework is that your job is to nurture and feed your baby; you need support that nurtures and feeds you so you can do that job.

### Managing Visitors

**Don't be deluged with visitors** in the first weeks. There will be plenty of time for visitors to come view and coo over the baby after the first month.

The reasoning for delaying visitors has three components:
1. You and baby need time to get breastfeeding well-launched
2. You need to become more secure in your ability to comfort your baby when he cries
3. You may be emotionally volatile from postpartum hormones (the author notes "you aren't crying yourself from wildly swinging postpartum hormones")

### Partner Discussion Points

Talk with your partner about how you both envision the first couple of weeks of your new family life. This should be an explicit conversation, not an assumption.

### Paternity Leave Data Point

**Fathers who take a couple of weeks off when their kids are born are closer to them at every stage of life, including adolescence.** This is presented as a consideration for the partner discussion about postpartum planning.

## Hospital Packing

### Two-Bag System

The recommendation is to pack two separate bags with different purposes:

**Labor bag** (for during labor):
- Insurance card
- Hospital paperwork
- Birth plan
- Camera/video camera
- Snacks
- Massage oil
- Relaxing music
- Tennis ball (specifically noted as useful for back labor)
- Any objects that will reassure and relax you (example given: "a tiny Buddha")

**Post-birth bag** (for after delivery):
- Diapers
- A few baby gowns
- Hats to keep the baby's tiny head warm
- Sanitary napkins
- Nursing bra
- Nursing nightgown

### Building Nurse Rapport

**Consider buying Starbucks gift cards to sweeten up the nurses.** The reasoning: if your partner makes friends with the nurses right away, they're more likely to accommodate requests that deviate from standard policies, such as walking up and down the halls during labor.

## Essential Baby Supplies

### Philosophy on Baby Shopping

The author notes that while long lists of baby items exist, "the truth is you don't need most of them." Additionally, many items won't be needed for a while (examples: stroller, CD with remote for rocking baby to sleep).

The practical constraint: you won't be shopping with a newborn, so essentials must be purchased in advance.

### The Essential Items List

**Sleep-related:**
- Bassinet or sidecar - described as a necessity if you feel uncomfortable having your newborn in bed with you
- Baby hammock - the author notes "I never used a crib for either child" and describes hammocks as "invaluable to help infants sleep"

**Nursing-related:**
- Glider or comfortable rocker - "not a necessity but oh so comfortable and smooth for nursing baby"
- Nursing pillow - "makes nursing much easier"
- Breast pump and bottles to express milk
- Salve to prevent cracked nipples
- Nursing bras and nursing clothes/nightgown "so that you can nurse easily"

**Baby carrying:**
- Sling - marked as "essential"
- Diaper bag

**Diapering:**
- A case or two of newborn diapers - the rule of thumb is ten diapers per day
- Changing pad
- Either washcloths or newborn wipes

**Clothing:**
- Undershirts or onesies
- Gowns
- Sleepers
- Socks
- Hats

**Blankets and outerwear:**
- Several receiving blankets
- A warmer blanket
- Baby bag (instead of snowsuit/coat)

**Safety and monitoring:**
- Infant car seat - note: "you might consider one that converts to a stroller"
- Baby monitor

**Baby containment:**
- Infant "bouncy" seat - described as "a place to put the baby down so she can watch safely while you cook or whatever"

## Breastfeeding Preparation

### The Case for Breastfeeding

The author states "no mincing words here" and presents the research as unequivocal: **breastfed babies are healthier and smarter, and the longer babies are nursed, the healthier and smarter they are.**

### Emotional and Bonding Effects

While few studies have been done specifically on the emotional effects of breastfeeding on mother or child, the following is noted:
- Nursing mothers experience hormonal changes that influence how they perceive their infant
- Many experts feel that the mother who nurses bonds more strongly with her infant
- This stronger bond results in a better relationship over time

### If You Cannot Breastfeed

The author addresses the failure question directly: "Are you a failure if for some reason you can't breastfeed, if for instance you end up on some medication that the baby can't have? Of course not."

However, the framing remains strong: "But you've missed a wonderful opportunity for infinite benefits to you and your child."

### The Path to Success

**If you plan to breastfeed, and give yourself the appropriate resources, you'll almost certainly be able to.**

### Common Challenges and Pitfalls

The author identifies why breastfeeding can be harder than expected: "We don't grow up watching moms and aunts nurse their babies, and it isn't second nature to us, so sometimes it isn't as easy to get started nursing as we expect."

**Specific pitfalls that can derail nursing intentions:**
- Unbearably sore nipples in the very beginning
- Baby having a hard time latching on
- Occasionally, babies are born with challenges such as being tongue-tied (which requires "a quick snip under their tongue by a doctor")

### Preparation Steps During Pregnancy

**Read breastfeeding books** - educate yourself through reading one or two good books on the subject.

**Buy a nursing pillow** - described as "invaluable."

**Arrange lactation support in advance** - call your local La Leche League chapter before birth to get breastfeeding consultant names handy. The reasoning: "Such an expert often makes all the difference in the world, and it is absolutely not worth the anxiety of muddling through when one session with an expert can put you and your baby on track."

The key insight is to set yourself up for breastfeeding success just as you set your birth up for success - this is positioned as equally important preparation.
