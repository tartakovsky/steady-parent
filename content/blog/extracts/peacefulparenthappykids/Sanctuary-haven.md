# Creating a Sanctuary: Making Your Home a Haven for Children

## Core Principle: Why Children Need a Sanctuary

**To flourish, every person needs a safe place, both physically and emotionally, to come home to.** This is especially true for children. If children are to turn their full attention to the many demands of growing up, they need a secure, peaceful home where they feel protected. They need to believe their parents can keep them safe from neighborhood bullies, from kidnappers, and from scary world events.

Modern homes have lost their function as sanctuaries for most families. Cell phone calls, texts, social media notifications, and emails constantly connect us to the outside world while simultaneously interrupting our contact with our families. In some homes, the TV runs constantly, broadcasting news of upsetting events and dramatic conflicts.

## The Deep Need for Connection

**No matter how independent children become as they pursue interests outside the home, they need to know they can count on the presence of their parents when they get home.** This need persists for a very long time. Your children would rather be with you than do anything else in the world for a surprisingly extended period. Even after they start having sleepovers and marathon baseball games, when they come home they want two things:

1. A safe place where they can be fully themselves
2. Connection with the rest of the family in a deep, comfortable, and fun way

**Warning sign:** If your child seems to live only for screen time, this signals a deeper hunger that needs filling. The screen fixation is a symptom, not the root problem.

## The Three Benefits of Providing Sanctuary

**Giving your child a sanctuary is an enormous gift.** It provides three distinct benefits:

1. **Recharging capacity** - It allows children to go out and do battle in the world, then return home to recharge
2. **Family culture strengthening** - It gives your family culture the cozy nest it needs to thrive
3. **Parent wellbeing** - Research shows that adults who consciously create homes where they find nurturance and beauty report better moods and less stressful lives

## Eight Strategies for Creating Sanctuary

### 1. Slow Down

We all love excitement, but stress kills. Literally. Stress erodes three critical things:
- Our patience
- Our ability to give our best to our kids
- Our health

**The honest self-assessment:** If we're honest with ourselves, we can usually see how we make our lives more stressful than they need to be, simply by being unwilling to make the choice to slow down.

**Direct connection to behavior:** If you want your kids to behave better, start by slowing down and not rushing so much. The rushing itself creates conditions for worse behavior.

### 2. Treat the Home as Sacred Space

Your children's home is their sanctuary. This means all household members treat each other respectfully. No violence, physical or verbal, is tolerated, including between children. This applies to sibling interactions as well as parent-child interactions.

### 3. Avoid Over-Structuring Home Time

Home needs to be **low-pressure time, not performance time.**

**The balance to strike:** All children need to be contributing members of the household. But they also need plenty of time to chill out.

**What to avoid:** Don't swamp children with too many obligations on top of:
- Homework
- Basic chores
- Music practice
- Religious studies
- Other regular commitments

**Special consideration for teenagers:** They are usually under tremendous stress already. Extra obligations at home compound this stress significantly.

### 4. Accept Your Children's "Baby Self"

**What the Baby Self is:** It's that part of your child that emerges in the form of regression when your child has been coping with lots of "grown-up" demands. All day they work hard to hold it together at school. When you show up, you evoke the Baby Self simply by being their parent. They fall apart. They whine, or at least act a bit childish.

**The wrong response:** Reprimanding them and demanding appropriate behavior. Consider how you would feel if you felt overwhelmed and whiny and your partner or friend demanded that you act more mature.

**The developmental reality:** All kids need a chance to be their Baby Self. The younger they are, the more time the Baby Self needs to be "out."

**The strategic benefit:** If you let your child be "little" when they need to be (during cozy times, at bedtime, when they are tired), you reduce the chance they'll disintegrate at inappropriate times (dinner with Grandma, in line at the supermarket).

**When to expect the Baby Self to emerge:**
- After a long day at preschool
- After that first sleepover
- After the school play she worked so hard on
- On Friday afternoon after a pressured week

**Why this is normal:** All children have to work hard to perform a high percentage of the time:
- Sitting still at school
- Negotiating with friends
- Performing in activities like sports

They all need a chance to let the "Baby Self" emerge without being ridiculed.

**The bittersweet reality:** While it sometimes seems as if they'll be babies forever, their Baby Selves will disappear sooner than you can imagine.

### 5. Provide Predictable Structure and Routines

**Kids need to know what to expect.**

**The empathy exercise:** Imagine yourself sitting working on a project when your spouse unexpectedly tells you it's time for a visit to the in-laws. You would resist this sudden change.

**Why structure matters:** Children often feel like they have little control over their lives. Springing schedule changes on them exacerbates this feeling and invariably creates resistance.

**Secondary benefit of structure:** It keeps things more organized, eliminating the stress of constant last-minute searches for things.

### 6. Limit Technology

**Model the behavior you want:** Set a good example by turning off your computer and cell phone to spend the evening with your family.

**Concrete suggestion:** Make it a family rule that Saturdays are technology-free.

**Diagnostic test:** Worried about how you'll cope with tech-free time? That's a sure sign that your household needs to schedule in a regular tech-free day.

**What to expect:** Try it as an experiment. You might all feel awkward as you start bumping up against each other ("Hey, you live here?"), but the connectedness will blow you away, and you won't go back.

### 7. Be Aware of the Impact of Sound

**The positive example:** One oncologist has peaceful music or waterfalls playing in every room of his house. He cites numerous studies proving that peaceful sounds offer protective nourishment to the immune system as well as the soul.

**What to minimize:**
- Loud TV
- Upsetting news
- Blaring traffic sounds

**Striking evidence about noise stress:** Seeing eye dogs who live in cities have shorter lives because of stressful noise levels. This illustrates how damaging constant noise exposure is to living beings.

**Practical implication:** Anything you can do to minimize traffic sounds will protect your family physically and emotionally.

### 8. Create a Supportive Family Culture

Deliberately building family identity and culture helps hold your family together through thick and thin. This requires conscious effort to establish rituals, traditions, and ways of being together that reinforce belonging and connection.

## Key Insight: The Relationship Between External Performance and Home Needs

Children spend enormous energy "performing" throughout their day:
- Sitting still at school
- Following rules
- Negotiating social dynamics with friends
- Competing in activities

This performance mode is exhausting. Home must serve as the counterbalance where performance is not required. When home becomes another place of performance demands, children lose their recharging station and behavioral problems increase.

## Warning About Screen Fixation

When children seem obsessed with screen time to the exclusion of family interaction, this is not primarily a screen problem. It signals that the child has an unmet need for something deeper, likely connection or a sense of safe haven. Addressing only the screen time without addressing the underlying need will not solve the problem.
