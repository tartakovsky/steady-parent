## Understanding Why Toddlers Hit Baby Siblings

### The Core Problem: Sibling Rivalry at Its Most Primal

When a baby sibling arrives, a toddler naturally panics and may try to "get rid of" the competitor. This is not monstrous behavior - it reflects perfectly normal feelings that the child is too young to verbalize. The toddler has had their parents all to themselves, and suddenly must share them. This creates devastation that manifests as sadness, fear, and anger. Because toddlers lack the words and self-awareness to express these feelings, they strike out physically instead.

**Key insight**: The behavior that looks like aggression is actually an expression of overwhelming emotions the child cannot process or articulate.

### Why Two-Year-Olds Are Particularly Vulnerable

Two-year-olds have very limited impulse control compared to older children. A four-year-old might have the same impulse to hurt a baby sibling but has developed better impulse control. Most two-year-olds will pinch a baby sibling if no adult is around - this is developmentally normal, not a sign of being a "terror."

Additionally, two-year-olds are in a developmental stage where they need a lot of control over their lives, which can intensify challenging behaviors.

### Closely Spaced Siblings Amplify the Challenge

When children are spaced close together, the older child is essentially still a baby themselves when the sibling arrives. A two-year-old with one or two younger siblings represents an enormous challenge for the family. Even with the best efforts, parents may struggle to have enough energy to be fully present for all children.

## The Three-Part Intervention Framework

### Intervention 1: Protect the Baby

This is the first priority. Two-year-olds need fairly constant monitoring, and infants need constant protection from toddlers. This is not punishment - it is recognition that toddler impulse control is limited and babies are vulnerable.

### Intervention 2: Connect with the Toddler

**Purpose**: Help the child not feel abandoned, and help them understand their tangled, angry feelings so they feel less "ugly inside."

**Why this works**: Just knowing that parents understand their hurt and fear relieves much of the child's frustration and reduces acting out.

**Why guilt doesn't work**: Humans defend against guilt by shutting down their feelings - both positive and negative. We need the toddler to stay in touch with positive feelings toward the parents, because they will only follow parental guidance to the degree they feel connected.

### Intervention 3: Set Very Firm Limits

This is where many parents struggle. The key message to communicate: "Feelings are given to us like arms and legs, but we are always responsible for what we do with them."

Name the behavior and reinforce repeatedly that it is off limits: "No pushing. Pushing hurts!"

**Critical nuance**: Limits must be enforced with empathy, not anger. The child will only obey limits to the degree they feel connected to the parent, and anger erodes that connection.

## The Relationship Component in Detail

### The Difference Between Talking About Feelings vs. Mandating Love

**Effective approach**: Empathizing with feelings to help the child understand their own anger and learn to manage it.

Example of effective language: "You seem very angry at your brother. Sometimes you feel so angry it makes you want to be mean, and hurt him. I wonder if you worry that mommy and daddy spend too much time with the baby and you want us to yourself. Lots of kids feel that way when they have a new baby in the house. Come and tell me whenever you feel that way. I love you and I always want to hear how you feel. Whenever you need me, you tell me, and I will find a way to take care of you."

**What to avoid**: Admonitions to love the sibling. Love cannot be mandated because love does not grow from guilt.

**Building empathy (different from mandating love)**: Observations designed to develop compassion naturally: "It really hurt the baby when you knocked him over this morning. Did you hear him cry? Poor baby. Remember when you fell on the playground, and cried, how much that hurt? The baby hurts, too, when he falls."

**Why this distinction matters**: The sweet lap-talk approach by itself is ineffective if not also accompanied by firm limits. The talk helps with emotional processing; the limits help with behavior.

### Pre-emptive Attention vs. Reactive Attention

**The wrong approach**: Waiting until the child does something wrong, then showering them with attention. This sends precisely the wrong message and doesn't fill the child's emotional need (similar to how asking a partner "do you love me?" doesn't fill that need).

**The right approach**: Give attention pre-emptively with generous amounts of "snuggle time" with both parents. When a child feels "full," they have less need to knock their sibling over. Spending one-on-one "special" time with each child invariably calms them down and makes them happier.

## The Limit-Setting Component in Detail

### The Sequence When an Older Sibling Hurts the Baby

**Step 1**: Pick up the baby and comfort them, for the moment ignoring the toddler.

**Step 2**: After the baby is calm and okay, put the baby in a safe place.

**Step 3**: Take a deep breath and turn attention to the toddler.

**Step 4**: Move in close to the toddler, look them in the eye, and say: "People are not for pushing. Pushing hurts. You must have been very upset to hurt the baby."

### Understanding the Child's Response

**Ideal outcome**: If the toddler is not too defended, they will burst into tears. This is good - they are letting out all the tears and fears that have been driving them to lash out.

**If the child doesn't cry**: You need to help them cry by setting a calm, kind limit. When the child feels safe and the adult stays compassionate, the child's worries usually come bubbling up to the surface so they can be expressed and healed.

**Defensive responses**: The child may push feelings down by:
- Lashing out at the parent
- Going glassy-eyed (running away inside)
- Simply running away

**Parent's role with defensive responses**: Stay as compassionate as possible and stay with the child, making eye contact and helping the child "show" their feelings. Use language like: "Sometimes you feel so upset about the baby... sometimes you wish the baby wasn't even here..."

Most toddlers will either agree angrily or move closer to tears at this point.

### The Healing Power of Expressed Feelings

**Key principle**: Once feelings are truly "felt," they evaporate. If the toddler feels free to show their tears and fears, they will no longer be driven by them, and the hitting will stop.

**If they still don't cry**: Kindly help them get in touch with feelings by reminding them: "Sometimes you wish you could have me all to yourself... I know... I miss our special snuggle times too."

## Redirection Strategies

### Physical Redirection

Since the toddler cannot yet control their impulse to hit, redirect that energy into acceptable expression.

Example language: "People are not for hitting. I know you feel angry right now. Can you show me how angry you are by stomping your foot?"

When the child stomps, respond: "Wow! You are showing me how mad you are! I see! You are very very very mad!"

**Why this works**: Having a witness who understands helps the child work through the emotions enough that they don't have to act them out through aggression.

### Fantasy Play

Playing games where the child can express their feelings through toys or symbolic play.

Example setup with trains: "How about this is the mommy engine, and the boy engine, and this is the new baby engine."

**Parent's role**: Simply observe, notice the storyline, and supply narration as the child initiates the action.

**Important clarification**: The point is not to create violent play, but to let the child express their feelings and acknowledge them with empathy.

### Art as Therapy

Ask the child to draw a family picture. When they leave out the baby, suggest: "Sometimes you wish the baby had never been born so you could keep mom and dad all to yourself."

### Books About Siblings

Reading books about toddlers with new siblings helps process feelings. The key is always respecting children's feelings while strongly enforcing limits on actions.

## Why Spanking Makes Hitting Worse

### The Logical Contradiction

Do you think hitting can teach a child not to hit? Children learn from what adults do, not what they say. When parents hit, they demonstrate that hitting must be acceptable since mommy and daddy do it too.

### Research Evidence

Hundreds of studies show that spanking always makes hitting worse. Spanking has negative effects on child development and continues to affect the person once grown.

### The Violence Perception

Spanking is always felt as violence to the child who is being hurt by the parent, regardless of how the parent frames it.

### Clarification on Non-Spanking Outcomes

Children who are not spanked will not automatically be angels. They will still have to learn to control angry feelings. However, there is more chance of success in learning emotional control if they are not spanked.

## The Importance of Both Components Working Together

**Relationship without limits**: Sweet talks on the lap about treating family with love are ineffective by themselves. Most two-year-olds are in a panic about their competitor and would like to eliminate them. They need to work hard for developing compassion to override their impulses.

**Limits without relationship**: Children will only obey limits to the degree they feel connected to the parent. Limits enforced with anger erode the connection that makes the limits effective.

**The integration**: Parents help children by:
1. Setting very firm limits ("No hitting!" - loud and clear, not a sweet taking onto the lap)
2. While maintaining connection and empathy in how those limits are delivered
3. And helping children process the underlying feelings that drive the behavior

## Supporting the Parents

When a family has multiple very young children (such as three under age three), the parents need substantial support. Having involved partners and extended family (like loving siblings/aunts/uncles) means other adults can be with the younger children while the toddler gets focused one-on-one attention.

What parents need: Empathy and more hands - not advice to spank.

## Summary of Core Reassurance to Provide Children

Children need reassurance that parents will:
- Always keep them safe
- Help them control their anger
- Help them not hurt others

This creates security rather than fear or guilt as the motivator for behavior change.
