# Feeding Your Toddler: Core Principles and Practical Guidance

## The Fundamental Division of Responsibility

The basic rule for feeding toddlers establishes a clear boundary between parent and child domains:

**Parent's responsibility**: Choose WHAT foods the child eats
**Child's responsibility**: Choose HOW MUCH they eat and HOW they eat it

This division exists because every person is born with **inner signals** that indicate how much they need to eat. When parents override these innate body cues by pressuring children to eat, they erode the child's natural self-regulation. This erosion causes later food issues ranging from pickiness to weight management problems.

The reasoning chain: Children know their bodies better than parents do -> Trusting their signals preserves self-regulation -> Preserved self-regulation prevents future eating problems

## Why You Cannot Win Food Battles

Toddlers don't need much food. Many eat a lot one day and very little the next. This pattern is normal because children don't starve themselves.

When parents obsess about how much a child eats or get into fights about food, they create power struggles. The core insight: **You cannot win a fight with someone about their own body.** And importantly, you wouldn't want to - forcing the issue damages the child's relationship with food and their own body signals.

If you want your child to regulate their own eating for the rest of their life, establish from the start that the child controls how much food enters their body. The parent's job is simply ensuring what's offered is healthy.

## Three Core Goals for Toddler Feeding

1. **Develop taste buds through variety** - Give your child opportunities to taste a wide range of foods, which develops their taste buds over time

2. **Delay sugar and salt cravings** - Keep exposed foods healthy to prevent early development of these cravings

3. **Diminish power struggles and eating disorder risk** - Give your child control over what they choose to put in their mouth

### Family Dinners: A Developmental Note

While lovely family dinners with conversation and connection are wonderful goals, toddlers are not yet developmentally ready for them. Don't expect a toddler to sit and eat for the time it takes an adult to consume a meal. For now, lay the foundation by keeping meals stress-free and enjoyable.

## Practical Strategies

**Delay sweets introduction**: Wait as long as possible before introducing sweets and don't keep them in the house

**Offer variety at each meal**: Present multiple healthy options

**Maintain regular timing**: Keep meal and snack times consistent

**Avoid pressure tactics**:
- Don't push your toddler to eat more than they want
- Don't reward eating a lot
- Don't follow your toddler around shoveling food into their mouth

**Let toddlers self-feed**: Yes, it's messy, but it's worth it. Use a splat mat to manage the mess.

## Snacks: Small Stomachs, Frequent Needs

Toddlers' little stomachs need numerous smallish meals throughout the day. This means snacks, but it never means unhealthy food.

**Best toddler snacks** are simply smaller portions of meal-appropriate foods:
- Healthy crackers with cheese or peanut butter
- Cut up fruit
- Soup
- Hard boiled eggs
- Yogurt
- Steamed broccoli

### The Bedtime Snack Pattern

Many toddlers are too busy during the day to eat enough and ask for food at bedtime. This drives parents around the bend unless you build a bedtime snack into the schedule. This often helps kids settle down and sleep better. You can combine it with the bedtime story if short on time, but bedtime snacks for toddlers are always a good idea.

## Understanding Picky Eating

Most toddlers go through a picky stage. There's an **evolutionary reason**: toddlers are genetically programmed to only eat familiar foods because unfamiliar foods could be poisonous. Those toddlers who were adventurous eaters probably didn't live long enough to pass their genes on. We most likely come from a long line of picky toddler eaters.

### What NOT To Do

**Don't make special food for your toddler at dinner** because:
1. You're bound to resent it
2. It sends the wrong message to the child

Instead, serve a variety of healthy foods and let them decide what to try.

### When Dinner Isn't Toddler-Friendly

If your dinner isn't toddler-friendly - for instance, if all the food is touching in a casserole - put some simple extras on the table:
- Cheese slices
- Hard-boiled egg
- Veggies with hummus for dipping

### Long-Term Outlook on Pickiness

Don't worry that your child will always be a picky eater. Permanent pickiness is rare, as long as children have an array of healthy foods to choose from and don't get addicted to junk food.

**Taste buds change** to enjoy a variety of tastes, including bitter tastes, as kids get older. Eventually virtually ALL kids come to enjoy the foods they've seen their parents enjoy.

## How to Talk About Food

**Focus on taste, not health benefits**

When you say "Delicious!" and clearly mean it as you take a taste, your child is much more likely to want to try it than when you say "This is so good for you!"

The mechanism: Children respond to genuine enjoyment and want to share in the experience, whereas health lectures don't motivate toddlers.

You can talk about healthy food choices, but taste should be the primary message.
