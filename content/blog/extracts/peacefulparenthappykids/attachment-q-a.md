# Attachment Parenting: Core Principles and Common Concerns

## The Foundation: Attunement Over Practices

**Secure attachment does not develop from imposing a set of practices on your baby.** It comes from staying attuned to your baby and responding to their needs. This is the fundamental principle that overrides any specific technique or method.

Every baby is different. Some babies love being in a sling, some hate it. Some don't sleep well with you, some don't sleep well without you. The key is that all babies will communicate what works for them if you listen. The practice itself matters less than the responsiveness behind it.

## The Nature of Infant Dependency

### Why Dependency Is Developmentally Appropriate

**Dependency is the natural state of small humans.** This is not a flaw to be corrected but a biological reality to be honored. When babies feel secure that "lions won't eat them," they are freed to concentrate on age-appropriate developmental tasks.

The progression works as follows: We fill children's dependency needs so that, once filled, they can move on to other things like exploring the world. Children who've been attachment-parented are age-appropriate in their relationship with their parents, moving from dependency to inter-dependence, and able to form fulfilling intimate relationships as adults.

### What Happens When Dependency Needs Go Unmet

When kids' attachment needs aren't filled, those needs eventually get focused on their peer group, often with disastrous results as they get older. The need doesn't disappear - it redirects toward less appropriate sources.

### The American Cultural Suspicion of Dependency

Americans are generally suspicious of dependency in any form. We constantly give parents the message that dependency in their kids is a character flaw attributable to bad parenting. However, **clinging is appropriate in small humans, just as in small chimpanzees.** This cultural bias works against understanding normal infant development.

## How Self-Soothing Actually Develops

### The Outdated "Self-Soothing" Argument

The claim that babies need to be put down to learn to self-soothe is an outdated rationalization. Research on brain development shows the opposite mechanism.

### The Real Neuroscience of Self-Soothing

**Babies learn to self-soothe by being comforted, which teaches them not to panic and that their emotions are manageable.** Being soothed when they cry actually changes brain chemistry and neural connections so babies learn to soothe themselves.

The alternative path: Being left to cry changes brain chemistry and neural connections so that babies become more easily upset and less able to soothe themselves as time goes on. **The amygdala actually becomes permanently enlarged** from chronic stress in infancy.

Babies don't learn to self-soothe by being put down. They learn not to depend on others because no one will come when they call. This is learned helplessness, not self-regulation.

### The Equivalence With Basic Care

Being soothed when upset is just as important to your baby's development as being fed and diapered. It is a core developmental need, not a preference or luxury.

## The Holding Question

### Why Babies Want to Be Held

Many babies expect to be held, especially in the beginning. Babies who are given the message that we won't pick them up when they cry eventually give up on having us meet their needs. This is not a win - it's "not a great start to their emotional development, and proven to lessen their ability to self-soothe as toddlers, preschoolers, and later."

### When Babies Don't Need to Be Held

All babies benefit from a certain amount of time to play independently and to watch you from a safe place as you chop onions or take a shower. Babies learn how to be alone and do their own "work" by being in your presence but not interacting. This is an important developmental task for all babies to master.

The key distinction: Babies can't focus on independent play during a moment when they need to be held. The skill develops in the context of security, not through forcing independence prematurely.

### The Paradox of Carried Babies

**Babies who are carried actually demand less attention than babies who are made to sit by themselves in strollers, seats, and playpens.** This happens because their needs for companionship and stimulation are met at the same time as they observe the world. When needs are met, babies don't have to work to get them met.

### When Babies Want to Be Put Down

Any self-respecting baby wants you to put them down well before they can crawl, so they can explore and start tearing up your house. The desire for independent exploration emerges naturally from a base of security.

## Managing Parental Overwhelm

### The Real Job Description

Your job is the baby, and your own health and well-being. Just because you're home with the baby doesn't mean it's your job to handle all the household chores by yourself.

### Practical Adjustments

It helps a lot to buy a sling or wrap so you have your hands free for food shopping or folding laundry. But it helps even more if you just let go of everything on your "to-do" list that isn't essential.

### The Long View on Priorities

Carrying your child as you go about your day will have positive resonance for the rest of their life, while messes are temporary. You will have a messier house and pasta again for supper. This is a valid trade.

### Mindset Shift

What we expect has a lot to do with how we feel about what we get. Instead of wondering why your baby won't let you put her down, understanding that it's better for her to be held a lot reframes the experience.

## Sleep and Night Parenting

### How Sleep Associations Form

Many babies don't learn to go to sleep by themselves because they have learned to fall asleep nursing or being rocked to sleep. These babies can be taught to go to sleep by themselves - what matters is the timing and method.

### Why Timing Matters

Babies need to be parented at night. It traumatizes them to be "taught" to sleep before they can understand what's happening. What's more, it traumatizes a child of any age to be left alone in the dark to cry without the comfort of a parent.

### The Gentle Alternative

When your child is old enough to learn new sleep associations (during their second year), you can stop rocking or nursing and just comfort your child back to sleep. They may cry, but they will have the comfort of your love, and they will learn the skill of putting themselves to sleep. The presence makes the difference.

### Why Babies Wake at Night

Babies form sleep associations with being nursed or rocked, so when they get to a very light stage of their sleep cycle, they wake up and need help to go back to sleep. Even toddlers have growth spurts that can make them hungry at night. Night waking isn't necessarily a problem to be solved.

### The Critical Importance of Parental Well-Being

The most important thing in being able to be a loving parent is that you not resent your baby. Nobody is a good parent when they're exhausted from being awakened all night long. If resentment is building, the problem needs to be addressed - but through gentle methods, not through traumatizing the baby.

## The Evidence Against Cry-It-Out Methods

### Biological Effects

Babies left to "cry it out" are flooded with **stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline, ACTH)** which destabilize their immune systems. We know it is bad for them biologically, at the very least.

### Memory Formation

When the brain is flooded with stress hormones, we are forming panic memories. Those memories don't vanish just because the child is preverbal. Researchers now suspect that such memories are instrumental in later anxiety and mood issues for some people.

### The Damage to the Parent-Child Relationship

Leaving your child to cry it out damages not only their trust in you, but your empathy for them. This undermines your ability to parent responsively, and that in itself is a risk factor for your child. The method damages both sides of the relationship.

### Individual Variation in Impact

The impact probably depends partly on the child: Does she learn to put herself to sleep in half an hour, or do you have to let her cry all night for a week in a row? Is this a one-time thing, or does it have to be repeated?

**It is rare for Ferbering to work quickly**, and parents report it needs to be repeated after every illness, trip, or other disruption.

### The Core Message Problem

Cry-it-out sleep training gives your child messages you really don't want to give her about your love being conditional and not dependable. Since little ones can be comforted and taught new sleep associations once they can understand, why take the risk?

## The Ferber Method Critique

### What Ferber Gets Right

Many babies don't learn to go to sleep by themselves, and these babies can be taught this skill.

### What Attachment Parents Take Issue With

1. **Timing**: How old should the baby be?
2. **Method**: There are gentle ways to teach babies this skill

### Professional Context

Ferber is a pediatrician, not a psychologist. Pediatricians are trained almost entirely in how to keep children's bodies healthy. They have very little training in psychological development. His book was written a long time ago, before we knew so much about infant brain development.

## Historical Context of Parenting Advice

### The Watson Legacy

Our child-raising tradition owes much to **John Watson**, who wrote in his famous parenting book published in 1928:

> "Treat them as though they were young adults... Never hug and kiss them, never let them sit on your lap. If you must, kiss them once on the forehead when they say goodnight. Shake hands with them in the morning. Give them a pat on the head if they have made an extraordinary good job of a difficult task."

### The Radical Dr. Spock

**Dr. Spock in 1946 was considered a radical** for suggesting that infants should be fed when they were hungry, rather than on a schedule. Ideas that seem obvious now were once controversial.

### The Sandra Scarr Example

Only 25 years ago, daycare advocate **Sandra Scarr** told the New York Times that before their second year, children's "brains are Jell-o and their memories are akin to those of decorticate rodents." Babies actually do an enormous amount of intellectual and emotional work in their first two years. Expert opinion can be spectacularly wrong.

## Cross-Cultural Perspective

### The Traditional Model

Human babies were never meant to be taken care of solely by their mothers. In most tribal communities, **babies are held by their dads 40% of the time**. In our closest primate relations, a lot of the holding is done by aunts, older siblings, and grandmothers. It really does take a village.

### How Western Practices Appear to Others

Most tribal people are shocked at what they see as the extreme negligence of Western parents, who put their babies in bouncy seats, swings, and strollers, and make them sleep alone all night in a crib.

They ask: "Don't the babies need to hear someone's heartbeat? Doesn't it damage their capacity to love others and feel safe in the world when they get older?"

### Cultural-Scale Consequences

To the degree that it damages the baby's ability to develop a secure attachment, recent research confirms their suspicions. One might even say that our whole culture, with its focus on violence and consumerism as opposed to human connection, is an unfortunate result of what happens when children's attachment needs are only minimally met.

## How Babies Communicate Their Needs

Infants can't use words to tell us what they need, but their crying certainly communicates if we listen.

**Historical comparison**: Only a century ago, it was thought that infants couldn't feel pain, and operations on them were done without anesthetic. They didn't verbally express their discomfort - they just screamed the whole time. The assumption that absence of verbal communication equals absence of experience has been proven catastrophically wrong before.

## The "Center of Attention" Concern

### The Validity of the Concern

It is true that it isn't good for babies to be the center of attention all the time.

### How Wearing Solves This

Babies love to watch you go about your work from the safe vantage point of a sling or backpack until they start creeping. That's how they learn. Being carried provides stimulation and companionship without the baby being the focus of interaction. The baby observes the world while feeling secure.
