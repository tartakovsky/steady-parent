## The Core Problem with Both Extremes

Most parents naturally gravitate toward one of two extremes, and neither works well:

**Permissive parents** hate causing their children upset. They don't want to incite tantrums, and they don't want their child to be angry at them. They also struggle to know whether their requests are developmentally reasonable. Combined with exhaustion, these factors lead them to avoid setting limits. The result: children who don't develop the ability to tolerate frustration or manage themselves. These children are often called "spoiled" by others. Research shows that without limits, kids have fewer opportunities to develop self-discipline.

**Strict (authoritarian) parents** boast about quick obedience - "I count to three and they jump." However, research consistently shows that strict parenting produces children with lower self-esteem who actually behave worse than other children (and therefore get punished more). These children often do well until high school, when it becomes apparent they haven't developed good judgment or the ability to think for themselves.

## Why Strict Parenting Fails

### 1. It Prevents Internalization of Self-Discipline

Harsh limits may temporarily control behavior, but they don't help children learn to self-regulate. Instead, harsh limits trigger resistance to taking responsibility. There is no internal tool more valuable than self-discipline, but it develops from the internalization of loving limits. No one likes to be controlled, so children reject limits that aren't empathic. They see the "locus of control" as outside themselves rather than wanting to behave well.

### 2. It Models Bullying

Limits without empathy are based on fear. If children do what you want because they fear you, that's functionally identical to bullying. Children learn what they live: if you yell, they'll yell; if you use force, they'll use force.

### 3. It Creates Anger and Depression

Authoritarian parenting makes it clear to children that parents aren't there to help them cope with difficult feelings that drive them to act out. Children are left lonely, trying to sort out for themselves how to overcome their "lesser" impulses. Learning this skill is a task all humans face, and we learn faster when we like ourselves. Harsh discipline teaches children that part of who they are is unacceptable, rather than teaching that they have choices about how to manage challenging emotions.

### 4. It Teaches That Power Is Always Right

Children learn to obey but don't learn to think for themselves. Later in life, they won't question authority when they should. They're less likely to take responsibility for their actions and more willing to follow the peer group or dodge responsibility by claiming they were "just following orders."

### 5. It Increases Rebellion

Studies show children raised with strict parenting tend to be more angry and rebellious as teenagers and young adults. Consider how this works for adults: virtually all of us were raised with some degree of harshness, and we chafe at control to that same degree - even when we're the ones imposing it. This manifests as problems regulating ourselves, anger at perceived limits or criticism, over-reacting when someone tries to tell us what to do, or rebelling against limits we impose on ourselves (like harshly starving with a diet then binging). Studies show kids raised strictly are more likely to develop eating disorders.

### 6. Children Only Behave When You're Watching

Because strictly raised children only "do right" when parents are present, they get into more trouble overall. They also become excellent liars.

### 7. It Undermines the Parent-Child Relationship

Parents who relate punitively must cut off their natural empathy for their children, making the relationship less satisfying for both. Parenting becomes much harder because children lose interest in pleasing their parents and become more difficult to manage. Children end up fighting with parents and carrying a chip on their shoulder. As they get older, they look for love in all the wrong places.

## Why Permissive Parenting Fails

### 1. Harmful Consequences from Unmet Limits

When parents grant desires that shouldn't be granted, it produces direct harm. For example, regularly allowing a child to stay up too late results in a cranky, exhausted child who can't handle age-appropriate developmental tasks. The child's self-esteem suffers because she can't manage things as well as other children.

### 2. Child's Needs Met at Others' Expense

When children's desires are consistently met at others' expense (siblings, parents, people at restaurants), children learn they always get their way in relationships. This makes it hard to form friendships or have satisfying romantic relationships. This is why permissively raised children are described as "self-centered" or "spoiled."

### 3. Children Learn Disappointment Is Intolerable

When children realize their parents will do almost anything to prevent disappointment, they learn that disappointment and sadness are intolerable. They spend the rest of their lives doing whatever is necessary to avoid these feelings. This avoidance manifests destructively: avoiding all risks, insisting on always getting their way, or cheating to win. Because they never learn comfort with challenging feelings, they develop low emotional intelligence (EQ).

### 4. No Self-Discipline Develops

Without learning to lovingly impose limits on themselves, children miss a crucial self-management skill needed for adulthood and even high school. Without self-discipline, they cannot work toward goals - a necessary component of creating a happy life. Permissive parenting sabotages the ability to achieve.

### 5. Children Misunderstand the Source of Happiness

Without experiencing limits, children never learn that happiness doesn't come from wish fulfillment and having one desire after another met. They don't discover that happiness can be maintained despite disappointment. They spend their lives pursuing one "thing" after another, but happiness eludes them.

### 6. Stable Internal Happiness Becomes Difficult

Permissive parenting makes it harder to develop stable internal happiness independent of circumstances. This happens because developing deep positive self-regard becomes more difficult.

**The mechanism**: Stable internal happiness comes from having one's full range of self accepted and understood, including the angry, sad, and disappointed parts. When parents act like those parts should be avoided, they communicate that part of the child's self is unacceptable. The child concludes they are not fully lovable.

### 7. Children Need Parents to Be in Charge

Children need to know their parents have a different role that includes keeping them safe. When people say "kids will keep pushing till they find the limits," this is what they mean. Children want limits because they want someone in charge. It's terrifying for children to think no one is in charge, protecting them from what can feel like a frightening world.

### 8. Parents Sacrifice What Matters

Permissive parents constantly compromise on things important to them: letting children treat them badly, allowing screen time addiction over schoolwork despite knowing it sabotages academic learning. These compromises make parenting less rewarding because parents sacrifice expectations that are important to them and beneficial to their children.

### 9. The Parent-Child Relationship Suffers

When children can't trust that parents will help them with the full range of emotions, they don't feel connected. When children don't trust that parents will enforce rules for health and safety ("OK, you don't have to wear your bike helmet" or "OK, you can stay at that party without parents"), they disrespect the parent and become more challenging, looking for limits as proof they're loved. When children mistreat parents, naturally parents become angry and resentful and less nurturing.

## The Sweet Spot: Empathic Limits

Research shows children develop optimally when we set limits as necessary but do so with empathy. The sweet spot is not simply a "happy medium" or compromise between permissive and strict approaches. That middle ground tends to compromise standards in ways that aren't good for children ("OK, you can stay up later") while still using punishments like timeouts - milder, but still punishments. This approach isn't great for either parents or children because parents feel forced to compromise their standards, and children still don't behave well (because punishment is still being used).

**What the sweet spot actually means**: The expectations and limits that keep children functioning at a high level, combined with the warmth and support associated with "permissive" parents. This combination of empathy and limits raises amazing children and makes for the best parenting experience.

Empathy makes limits more palatable to children, so they don't resist as much. This is what allows children to internalize the limits. **Children need appropriate limits, but how you deliver them is what counts.**

## The Foundational Framework: Why Limits Matter

Understanding the neuroscience: As children face the necessity to rein in impulses toward something they want (like grabbing a toy from a baby) in order to have something they want more (a warm, happy connection with you), they learn self-control. Parents' limits actually teach children to set limits for themselves - this is self-discipline.

**Infants versus toddlers**: Infants' wants are identical to their needs. But over time this changes. By the toddler stage, children's wants often directly oppose their long-term developmental needs and safety. Parents must make this developmental leap and learn to set limits accordingly.

## How to Practice Empathic Limit-Setting

Effective limit-setting is not just having the courage to say "No" and enforce it. That's not effective. Effective limit-setting requires empathy:

1. **Start with a strong, supportive connection** so your child knows you're on their side
2. **See it from their point of view** and offer genuine empathy they can feel while setting the limit
3. **Resist any temptation to be punitive** - setting the limit teaches the lesson; anything more backfires
4. **Only set limits you really need to set** - see life from their point of view so their life is more about connection and discovery than limits and frustration; saying "No" too often undermines your relationship

## Deciding Which Limits Are Necessary

You already know the answer to this:

**Non-negotiable**: Safety for themselves and others

**Important but always in progress**: Treating others with respect - teaching children they can advocate for their own needs without attacking anyone else

**Changing over time**: Other rules like cleaning up messes, not interrupting mid-sentence - if you see things from their perspective and keep in mind what's age-appropriate, you'll know what they're ready to handle. You'll also see what they need (like a good night's sleep) and be prepared to enforce those things.

Don't go out of your way to create unnecessary limits, but don't hesitate to set necessary ones. Make sure you have a strong emotional connection so you can offer genuine empathy that they can feel during limit-setting.

## Setting Limits Is NOT Punishment

**Critical distinction**: Loving guidance and empathic limits help children WANT to follow guidance, so good habits become part of who they are whether or not you're present. "Consequences" designed to punish produce the opposite effect because children rebel against them.

**Example of the difference**: If you have to remove a child from the park for throwing sand, doing it as punishment causes the child to get stuck in the injustice and anger at you - the lesson is lost. Instead, say: "It was too hard for you to stop throwing sand. But throwing sand hurts people, so we had to leave. Soon you will be able to stop yourself, so we can stay and play. We can try again tomorrow." The child is still upset about leaving, but sees you as on their side, and staying at the park next time is within their power.

## How to Handle Tantrums When Setting Limits

Children are allowed to have feelings. It's natural for them to feel anger and disappointment when limits are set. Your job is to accept those feelings and love them through it. The more you do this, the less overwhelming their feelings become, and the less they'll tantrum.

**The danger of not accepting feelings**: If you can't tolerate their anger and sadness - if their reaction to the limit isn't met with empathy - they learn that part of who they are is unacceptable, that they are shameful, and completely alone. Like any unacknowledged emotion, anger and sadness don't vanish; they go underground where they magnify and sow seeds of depression.

**The mechanism of acceptance**: If parents provide an emotional "holding environment" while reinforcing the limit, children have freedom to rail against the limit, cry and grieve about it, and finally accept it and move on.

Moving on means letting go of that path and finding another acceptable path. Example: "I can't play with Maggie right now; I'll see her tomorrow."

Firm limits with empathy allow children to experience their full reactions and come out the other side. The child learns the world is full of obstacles to desires, but isn't left fighting that reality (which happens when limits aren't clearly reinforced). They grieve and move on, looking for another way to feel better.

They're also not left hopeless and depressed (which happens with authoritarian limit-setting that makes them feel like a bad person).

**What children gain**: They learn they can't always get their way, but they get something better - someone who loves and accepts the full range of who they are. This unconditional positive regard becomes the core of unshakeable positive self-esteem and stable internal happiness. They also learn they can tolerate rage and misery and feel better afterward - the beginning of resilience as they consider other courses of action.

**Example of resilience developing**: "I can't have my birthday party at the circus because we can't afford it. I cried about it all day yesterday. But mom and dad seem to understand. Maybe they would help me design a soccer party in the park and let me have the girls stay for a sleepover."

## How Many Limits Is Optimal?

More frustrations is NOT better. Two reasons:

1. **You need a strong emotional bond for empathy to work**. If children experience you as sabotaging their happiness by creating arbitrary or unfair limits, they won't accept your empathy. After all, you have the power to grant their desire and you keep refusing.

2. **Children have plenty of frustrations daily without you creating more**. There's no need to manufacture additional ones.

## Special Considerations for Babies

Most principles about limits apply to babies too - sometimes you need to enforce limits (like not letting them stick a finger in a light socket), and you need to empathize with their disappointment. However, babies can tolerate much less frustration because they haven't learned to manage their feelings yet.

**Critical insight**: There's increasing evidence that moods in infancy lay groundwork for mood habits later in life. You want to minimize the amount of time your baby spends unhappy. If babies get used to being unhappy, they think unhappiness is a normal state and do their best to recreate it throughout life. With babies, always minimize frustration.

**Practical approach**: You can't give babies everything they want, but babies can generally be distracted. Babyproof and stay a step ahead. Gradually increase limit-setting as your child moves from babyhood to toddlerhood to preschool, because it becomes clear that appropriate behavior demands it and that they can handle it. Remember: They're not trying to drive you crazy, and they're not bad for wanting something, even something patently impossible. What babies need is your empathy when you have to say no.

## A Note on Attachment Parenting

"Attachment Parenting" is about meeting children's needs for connection - it does not preclude setting limits. No attachment expert discourages empathic limit-setting.

Giving children more say over their lives as they gain maturity is desirable, but you wouldn't let a toddler make all their own decisions, and most fourteen-year-olds aren't ready to either.

**The key**: Parents need to feel comfortable setting limits when necessary. Studies show children raised too permissively become "difficult" - unable to manage themselves, inconsiderate of others, and unable to form mutually satisfying relationships.

**A common fear**: Many permissive parents fear losing their child's love. While rejecting the authoritarian role is good, rejecting the role of parent is not. All parents have a critical responsibility to teach and guide their young. That necessarily includes setting limits.

## Research Support

The approach described here is sometimes called "authoritative" parenting (distinct from "authoritarian"), but a better term is **Empathic Limits** - limits set like authoritarian parents set them, but delivered with empathy like permissive parents offer.

Numerous peer-reviewed studies support this approach. A comprehensive resource is the index of Alfie Kohn's book "Unconditional Parenting," which lists hundreds of peer-reviewed studies supporting this view.

- Children need limits for healthy emotional development
- How you deliver limits matters as much as the limits themselves
- Limits should be set with empathy, in the context of a strong parent-child connection
- Setting limits is not the same as punishment - the limit itself teaches the lesson
- Children's negative reactions to limits should be met with empathy, not suppression
- Babies need minimal frustration; gradually increase limit-setting as children develop
- Children actually want someone in charge who will keep them safe
- Self-discipline develops from internalizing loving limits, not from fear of punishment
