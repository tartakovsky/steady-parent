# Managing Out-of-Control Toddler Behavior

## The Core Framework: Four Essential Steps

Dr. Laura Markham presents a four-part framework for managing challenging toddler behavior, with an emphasis on addressing root causes rather than surface behaviors.

### Step 1: Regulate Your Own Emotions First

The parent must manage their own emotional state before addressing the child's behavior. This is foundational because **if a parent has "tantrums," the child will be out of control too**. There is a direct modeling relationship between parent emotional regulation and child emotional regulation.

**Practical application:** When triggered (which will happen because parents are human), the correct response is to physically move away from the situation and calm down before re-engaging with the child. The goal is not to never feel triggered, but to avoid interacting while in a triggered state.

**Why this matters first:** A dysregulated parent cannot effectively help a dysregulated child. The parent's emotional state directly influences the child's capacity to regulate.

### Step 2: Connect With the Child

Maintaining connection is essential even during difficult behavioral episodes. The question asker was already practicing attachment parenting (breastfeeding, bedsharing, never using cry-it-out methods, attempting empathy), but **anger was getting in the way of connection**.

**Key insight:** Connection practices can be undermined when anger causes the parent to emotionally "turn off." This disconnect breaks the attachment relationship that the parent worked to build when the child was a baby.

### Step 3: Help the Child Process Underlying Emotions

**This is identified as the MOST IMPORTANT piece and the most commonly missing element.**

The behaviors (biting, hitting, throwing toys, throwing food) are driven by emotions that the child cannot process or express appropriately. The solution is not to punish the behavior but to address the emotional root cause.

**Critical reframe:** Sometimes children need to cry, and the parent's role is to love them through it. This means allowing emotional expression while providing supportive presence, not stopping the emotional expression or treating it as misbehavior.

### Step 4: Understand Age-Appropriate Behavior and Redirect

Recognition that some behavior is developmentally normal for toddlers (specifically age 2.5 in this case). The child is described as a "super active little guy," suggesting that high activity level is a temperament trait, not a behavior problem.

**Redirection** is the appropriate response for age-appropriate behavior, not punishment.

## What Does NOT Work (Anti-Patterns)

The parent had already tried several discipline approaches that failed:

- **Time out chair** - Did not work
- **Taking away toys** - Did not work; actually made behaviors worse (more biting and hitting)
- **Smacking** - Parent refused to use (aligned with attachment parenting values)
- **Biting back** - Parent refused to use

**Why punitive approaches backfire:** Taking toys away made the child bite and hit *more*. This demonstrates that punishment-based approaches do not address the underlying emotional dysregulation and may actually intensify it.

## The Emotional Dynamics at Play

### Parent's Experience
- Constant anger
- "Turning off" emotionally as a coping mechanism
- Desire to restore the closeness they had when the child was a baby
- Conflicting needs: wanting connection AND wanting the child to listen and stop hurting them

### Child's Behavior Pattern
- Not listening to anything
- Biting and hitting
- "Generally being crazy"
- Throwing toys (including at people)
- Throwing food and water

**Interpretation:** These behaviors are symptoms of emotional distress, not defiance. The child is communicating something through behavior that they cannot articulate verbally.

## Key Principles

**Attachment parenting becomes harder as children age** - The parent notes that while they practiced attachment parenting from infancy, it became more challenging as the child got older. This is normal and expected.

**Behavior is communication** - The hitting, biting, and throwing are attempts to express emotions that the toddler cannot verbalize. Treating behavior as the problem misses the underlying cause.

**Connection and boundaries are not mutually exclusive** - The parent expressed wanting both closeness AND for the child to stop hurting them. The framework suggests these are achieved together, not traded off against each other.

**Emotional co-regulation** - The parent's emotional state directly affects the child's capacity to regulate. This is why self-regulation comes first in the framework.
