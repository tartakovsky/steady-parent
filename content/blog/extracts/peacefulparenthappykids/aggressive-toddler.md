## Key Insights

### Why Toddlers Hit
- Most two-year-olds experiment with aggression because they are still learning to control themselves
- Children lash out when they are hurting inside - hitting is driven by underlying feelings
- Household tensions and marital conflict can cause children to act out aggressively

### Why Hitting Back and Timeouts Don't Work
- Studies show that hitting children, even to demonstrate that hitting hurts, only perpetuates more hitting
- When parents hit children, children learn to hit; when parents respond with compassion, children learn not to hit
- Timeouts create power struggles and cause children to be more rebellious, potentially increasing hitting behavior
- Timeouts do not encourage good behavior - they actually encourage bad behavior

### Effective Response to Hitting

#### When Child Hits Another Child
1. Set the limit clearly: hitting is never okay
2. First attend to the other child so your child sees the impact of their actions
3. Remove your child from the situation (kindly but firmly)
4. Say: "When you hit, we can't play with the other children"
5. Empathize with their feelings: "You wish you could play more. You don't want to leave"
6. Stay kind and compassionate - allow crying (tears heal the upset that drove the hitting)
7. Reassure them they're not bad, just little: "Soon you will be a little older and you will remember not to hit"

#### When Child Hits Parent
1. Tell them: "Hitting hurts. I know you're angry"
2. Offer alternatives: "Use your words and tell me. You can show me how angry you are by stomping"
3. Set the firm limit: "We never hit"
4. Overcome your own anger at being hit and extend empathy
5. Recognize that if a child hits their parent, the relationship needs attention

### Core Principles
- When we treat children with compassion and kindness, even when they hit others, they learn not to hit
- The way to stop hitting is to help children with the feelings that are driving the hitting
- Removing a child from a situation is never a punishment - it's helping them with their feelings
- Children need to hear they aren't bad, just little

## Practical Phrases to Use
- "When you hit, we can't play with the other children"
- "You wish you could play more. You don't want to leave. I am really sorry, but when you hit, we can't play with the other kids"
- "Hitting hurts. I know you're angry. Use your words and tell me"
- "You can show me how angry you are by stomping, like this. But we never hit"
- "Soon you will be a little older and you will remember not to hit. You will remember to ask me for help, or to use your words, instead"

## Additional Context
- If marital tension exists, consider counseling (even individual counseling helps)
- Divorce and marital tension are hard on kids and can manifest as aggression
- Parental physical aggression witnessed by children is harmful
