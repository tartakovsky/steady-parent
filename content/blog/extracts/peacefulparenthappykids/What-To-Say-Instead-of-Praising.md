## Core Problem with Conventional Praise

The issue with praise - and especially "Good job!" - is the **evaluation inherent in it**. No one likes to feel constantly judged. This constant evaluation has a dampening effect on:
- Confidence
- Initiative
- The ability to take pride in one's own accomplishments

Children need to feel seen, accepted, and encouraged no matter what, but praise is not the best way to accomplish this. The problem isn't positive feedback itself - it's the judgmental framing that makes children dependent on external validation rather than developing internal satisfaction.

Research on the relationship ratio: It takes at least **7 positive interactions to outweigh each negative interaction** if you want to maintain a good relationship. While hugs and smiles help, parents are in constant verbal interaction with children, making the choice of words significant.

## The Core Shift: From Evaluation to Observation

Instead of telling children what's "good" or "bad," the approach shifts to:
1. **Helping children see their power in the world** - showing them that their actions have real effects
2. **Letting children decide whether to repeat behaviors** based on the natural feelings those actions create, rather than chasing praise
3. **Mirroring their experience** rather than dictating what they should feel

This creates intrinsic motivation rather than approval-seeking behavior.

## Specific Alternatives and Their Reasoning

### Sharing Behaviors

**Instead of:** "Good sharing!"
**Try:** "Wow! Look how happy your brother is to have a turn with your toy."

**Why this works:** Rather than labeling the behavior as "good," you're showing the child the concrete result of their action. The child can then decide whether to repeat the behavior to get that good feeling inside - rather than just to get praise from outside. This helps children understand in ways they can easily grasp that their actions really do matter.

### Creative Work (Painting, Art)

**Instead of:** "What an incredible painting!"
**Try:** "I saw you working hard on that painting. Can you tell me about it?"

**Why this works:** The goal isn't to have a Van Gogh at age four - it's for the child to enjoy the exploration, the process, the work, and to go on to do more painting. **Research shows that when we evaluate children's creative work, they worry that their next attempt won't be as good, so they stop trying.** By noticing effort rather than outcome, you remove the performance pressure.

Note on value judgments: There are still value judgments inherent in this feedback (noticing "hard work" is a value). It's not problematic to focus positive attention on what we value - we're guiding our children all day according to our values. What matters is being intentional about which values you're actually promoting with your feedback.

### Sports and Performance

**Instead of:** "You played better today; you almost scored a goal."
**Try:** "I love to watch you play!"

**Why this works:** The first version sends the message that playing isn't worth anything unless they score a goal. You can't tell kids that sports are about fun and teamwork while simultaneously pushing them to be the one who scores.

**Important insight from children themselves:** Kids who play sports say the worst part is the ride home in the car when parents inevitably comment on how they can improve their playing. **Let the coach play that role.** Your role as the parent is to enjoy your child's playing, so that they can find joy in it.

### Intelligence and Ability

**Instead of:** "You're so smart!"
**Try:** "You just kept trying, and you figured it out!"

**Why this works:** Kids who are told they're smart develop a problematic belief: if they have to work at something, it means they aren't so smart after all. This creates avoidance of challenges.

The reframe: Help them understand that **the brain is like a muscle that they can grow**. Once children realize that if they keep working at something they can figure it out, they gain the confidence to learn and master anything. This is the foundation of a **growth mindset**.

### Pride and Accomplishment

**Instead of:** "I'm so proud of you!"
**Try:** "You must be so proud of yourself!"

**Why this works:** "I'm proud of you" puts the focus on the parent's approval, while "You must be so proud of yourself" helps the child connect with their own sense of accomplishment and self-worth. When children learn to look inward - to notice what it feels like to work hard, persist, and succeed - they build genuine confidence that doesn't depend on praise or outside validation.

**Important nuance:** It's not wrong to tell your child you're proud of them - every child needs to feel that love and delight reflected back from their parent. Use it thoughtfully, and balance it with messages that remind your child that they are the ultimate judge of their own effort and growth. That's what builds a sturdy, self-sustaining sense of pride.

### General Success

**Instead of:** "Good job!"
**Try:** "You did it!" or "Wow! Look at you up there!"

**Why this works:** The child needs to know you noticed that they did it, and maybe that you're impressed if you genuinely are. But you're mirroring their excitement, not telling them what to feel. Leave the evaluation of whether it's "good" to them.

### Helping and Cooperation

**Instead of:** "Big girls help Mommy."
**Try:** "When you help me like this, we get done so quickly - I love it! Thank you."

**Why this works:** You're teaching your child how to have a relationship with another person. The child needs to know - without guilt trips - that what they do has an effect on the other person, so they can choose their actions. It isn't about evaluating them as a human being; it's about helping them understand relationship dynamics.

### General Good Behavior

**Instead of:** "You're such an angel today."
**Try:** "I'm having such a good time singing with you today. I love it when we have so much fun together."

**Why non-specific praise backfires:** Your child knows they aren't a little angel - they're a fallible human being. If you forget that, they'll need to show you by acting out in the worst way they can think of. It's simply too much pressure to live up to. Instead, be specific about what you like, so they can see that yes, they really are doing this thing you admire, and if they want to, they can choose to do it again.

### Unconditional Love

**Instead of:** "You're a good boy."
**Try:** "I am so happy I get to be your mom. I love you so much, no matter what!"

**Why this matters:** Telling a child they're "good" evaluates conditionally. But worse, how does the child know what to do to try to "be a good boy" again in the future? It's so global and applied to all kinds of different behavior that it becomes meaningless as guidance.

**The one kind of general positive feedback that always works:** Feedback about you and your feelings. Your delight in your child, your unconditional attention and acknowledgment and approval, just for being who they are - that's not about something they're doing but about something you feel for them that they never have to perform to get. Every child needs to hear this often.

## Keeping the Focus on the Child's Internal Experience

These phrases acknowledge positive feelings without inserting your judgment:

- **"You must feel so good about that!"** - acknowledges their positive feelings without external evaluation
- **"How does it feel to have figured that out?"** - invites them to reflect on their own satisfaction and learning process
- **"You did that all by yourself!"** - emphasizes their independence and capability
- **"Look what you're capable of!"** - helps them recognize their own growing abilities
- **"You should feel really good about that choice"** - validates their decision-making while keeping the good feeling centered in them
- **"That must have felt amazing when you succeeded!"** - connects them to the natural high of achievement

**The outcome:** When children learn to recognize and trust their own feelings of pride and satisfaction, they become less dependent on external validation and more confident in their own judgment. This approach builds self-reliance rather than approval-seeking.

## Four Categories of Acknowledgment (Instead of Praise)

### 1. Focus on Effort and Process

Examples:
- "I noticed how hard you worked on that"
- "You didn't give up even when it got difficult"

**Why:** This helps children understand that persistence and effort matter more than just outcomes.

### 2. Acknowledge Specific Actions

Examples:
- "You were really kind when you helped your friend"
- "You explained that math problem so clearly"

**Why:** Shows you're paying attention to their particular strengths and choices, making the feedback meaningful and actionable.

### 3. Recognize Growth

Examples:
- "You're getting better at sharing your toys"
- "I can see how much your reading has improved"

**Why:** Highlights their progress and development, reinforcing that improvement happens over time with effort.

### 4. Emphasize Internal Satisfaction

Examples:
- "You look really happy with how that turned out"
- "How do you feel about what you accomplished?"

**Why:** Helps them develop intrinsic motivation rather than seeking external approval.

### Bonus: Celebrate Character

Examples:
- "That was a brave choice"
- "You showed real thoughtfulness"

**Why:** Reinforces positive character traits by naming them specifically.

## The Value Question: Can You Influence Your Child?

The approach doesn't mean you can't influence your child by telling them that you like what they're doing. Children need to know that their contributions are valued. The danger is when children get the message that they're only good enough if they do things your way. The distinction is between:

- **Helpful:** Sharing your genuine response to their actions
- **Harmful:** Creating conditional acceptance based on performance

## Key Quote (Alfie Kohn)

"What kids do need is unconditional support, love with no strings attached. That's not just different from praise - it's the opposite of praise. 'Good job!' is conditional. It means we're offering attention and acknowledgment and approval for jumping through our hoops, for doing things that please us."

This captures the fundamental distinction: unconditional love is the opposite of conditional praise. Children need to feel valued for who they are, not just for what they do that pleases adults.

## Practical Implementation

The article suggests a simple retraining method: Write down a few phrases you want to start using and try them out. The expected results of making this shift include children becoming:
- More thoughtful
- More self-motivated
- Happier

The positive encouragement parents give can become a "super-power" for children when it's framed correctly - building them up from the inside rather than making them dependent on external validation.
