## When to Seek Professional Help vs. Providing Time and Love

### The Core Rule of Thumb

A child needs professional help when something is getting in the way of them meeting **normal developmental challenges** and coping with daily life. The key assessment criteria are whether the child is still functioning well in three domains:

- At school
- With peers
- At home

If a child is functioning well across all three areas, their regression is likely a **temporary challenge** that they have the inner resources and external support to handle. This means parents can address it with time, love, and appropriate home-based strategies rather than immediately seeking professional intervention.

### Why Regression at Age Ten is Often Normal

Multiple factors converge at age ten that make anxiety and regressive behaviors common and expected:

**Pubertal Hormones**: Ten year olds are solidly in the grip of pubertal hormones. These hormones can make it hard for kids to fall asleep at night, which gives their minds too much opportunity for anxious rumination. The hormonal changes also create internal instability that naturally increases anxiety.

**Sleep Disruption from Screens**: Computer and TV screens in the hours before bedtime suppress melatonin and make it hard for kids to fall asleep. Research indicates that one reason kids' body clocks get thrown off at puberty is that their computer, cell phone, and TV use increases and suppresses normal melatonin production.

**The Tween Paradox**: Both tween boys and girls feel pressure to separate from their parents at the exact time when they desperately crave parental support and guidance. This creates an internal conflict that often manifests as regressive behavior when at home with parents, even while appearing independent outside the home.

**Academic Pressure**: Academic pressure increases around this age and the work gets harder, adding to overall stress load.

**Social Scene Changes**: The social scene changes dramatically for both boys and girls at age ten. All the social rules change as some kids become "cool" and ditch their previous friends. This social upheaval creates significant anxiety even for well-adjusted children.

**Gender-Specific Anxieties**: Girls in particular often see the burdens of being a teenage girl as scary, including menstrual periods and male attention. This future-oriented anxiety can drive present-day clingy behavior.

### Examples of Normal Range Behaviors

A boy who is having a hard time falling asleep at night is within the normal range for a ten year old experiencing puberty. This is especially true given how hormones affect sleep cycles and how screens suppress melatonin.

A girl who wants as much time with her mother as possible and needs coaxing to leave for activities she normally loves (like school and dance) is also within the normal range. The key indicator of normalcy is that she does eventually get there and engage, even if reluctantly.

## Important Caveat: Investigating Potential Triggers

Even when behavior seems within the normal range, parents should investigate whether a specific event triggered the regression. This is especially important when **multiple children regress simultaneously**, as this pattern suggests a shared triggering event.

### Range of Potential Triggers

Triggers can range from minor to major:

**Minor triggers**:
- A very upsetting movie
- Stumbling on a pornographic website

**Major triggers**:
- Death of someone they know
- Bullying
- Abuse

The fact that something is possible does not mean it is likely. The mention of abuse or bullying represents a "tiny chance" but one worth considering and gently exploring.

## How to Have the Investigation Conversation

### Setup and Timing

The optimal time for this conversation is at **bedtime while lying in the child's bed with them in the dark**. Children feel safer in this environment and are more likely to open up.

Talk to children **separately** rather than together. This allows each child to share without being influenced by the other's presence or concerns about what the other might hear.

### The Conversation Structure

**Step 1: Name the Observation**
Point out that you have noticed a difference in their behavior. This normalizes the conversation and shows you are paying attention.

**Step 2: Normalize Anxiety**
Say that all kids get anxious sometimes. This removes shame and makes it easier for them to share.

**Step 3: Ask About Specifics**
Wonder aloud whether there is something specific worrying them. Keep the question open-ended.

**Step 4: Listen and Reflect**
After asking, listen, reflect, empathize, breathe, and let them tell you everything worrisome on their minds. Do not rush to fix or dismiss. The goal is complete emotional unburdening.

### Post-Conversation Management

Turn the lights off earlier than usual to give the child time to wind down after discussing their worries. Anxious content is not a good prelude to sleep.

Have another topic ready to finish off the discussion that is a better prelude to sleep, such as what they are looking forward to over the weekend. This allows the conversation to end on a positive, forward-looking note rather than leaving the child stirred up from discussing worries.

## Practical Remedies for Tween Anxiety

### Melatonin Supplementation

**Melatonin** in small dosages relaxes kids and helps them fall asleep. The recommended starting dose is **1 milligram for a ten year old**, though parents should confirm with their doctor.

The rationale for melatonin is that puberty, combined with increased screen use, suppresses normal melatonin production. Supplementing replaces what is being artificially suppressed.

### Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)

**EFT** (Emotional Freedom Technique) is mentioned as a tool to assuage anxiety and a good skill to teach children. The value is that it gives children a self-administered technique they can use independently when anxiety arises.

## Parental Anxiety About Child Anxiety

An important dynamic is that parents can become anxious about their child's anxiety. When the parent receives reassurance that the behavior is normal, this relieves the parental anxiety, which often improves the situation.

In the follow-up from the parent who asked the original question: after receiving advice and having her own anxiety relieved, her daughter improved significantly and her son was getting better. The parent noted that perhaps the biggest help was relieving her own anxiety about their anxiety.

This suggests a feedback loop: parental anxiety about child anxiety can intensify the child's anxiety. When parents feel confident that the behavior is normal and manageable, they communicate that confidence to their children, who in turn feel safer.

## Key Distinctions

**Regression vs. Problem**: Needing parents more does not mean something is wrong with the child. Regression during times of developmental change is a normal coping mechanism, not a pathology.

**Temporary vs. Chronic**: The question is not whether a child is anxious, but whether that anxiety prevents them from functioning. Temporary challenges with adequate support are different from chronic conditions requiring intervention.

**Coaxing vs. Inability**: A child who needs coaxing to do something they love but ultimately does it is different from a child who cannot do it at all. The first indicates normal-range anxiety; the second might indicate need for professional evaluation.
