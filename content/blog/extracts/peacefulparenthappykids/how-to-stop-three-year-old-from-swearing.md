## Core Framework: Why Three-Year-Olds Swear

Three-year-olds are in a developmental stage of experimenting with **power**. When a child discovers a swear word, they've found something extremely powerful - a single word that can generate intense reactions from adults. The child functions like an "energy enthusiast": anything that produces emotional energy or "juice" from a parent will be repeated.

This explains why ignoring swear words, while commonly recommended by experts, often fails. Children are perceptive enough to sense the parent's suppressed reaction even when the parent doesn't verbally respond. The child knows the word has power. When the parent doesn't react and help them understand what the word means, the child naturally experiments further - trying the word on other people to test its effect.

**The fundamental principle**: telling a child that a word is "bad" increases their fascination with it rather than reducing it. Forbidden things become more enticing, not less.

## The Three-Strategy Approach

The solution combines three complementary strategies that work together:
1. Explanation and redirection to substitutes
2. Safe experimentation opportunities
3. Elimination of power struggles

Each strategy addresses a different aspect of why the child is drawn to the word.

## Strategy 1: Redirection

### How to Explain Swear Words to a Preschooler

Start by asking the child what they think the word means. This opens dialogue and helps you understand their mental model.

Then explain: swear words are rude words that people use when they are very angry and cannot figure out how to express their feelings respectfully. People say these words just to make someone else feel bad - like an attack, the same as calling someone a name.

**Concrete framing for the child**: Connect to their experience. Point out that saying that word made your friend feel bad and makes you feel bad. That's because it's a "rude" word, sort of like calling someone a name - it's an attack.

**Express confidence in the child**: "I know you're smarter than that, and I bet you can come up with lots of words to use when you are angry or frustrated, so you can express yourself without attacking."

**Connect to existing family rules**: "In our house, no one ever calls anyone else names; that's the rule." This frames the swear word prohibition as an extension of rules the child already understands and follows.

### Creating Alternative Words

Turn the conversation into a brainstorming game. Create a list together of things the child can say when frustrated or angry that are not rude. Examples:
- "I'm furious!"
- "Agamemnon!"
- "Buffalo Bung!"

Write down the list and post it on the fridge. Since preschoolers cannot read, posting the list alone is not sufficient. The parent must actively begin using these alternative words around the house in a fun way. This models the behavior and normalizes using silly substitute words for expressing frustration.

## Strategy 2: Let the Child Experiment Safely

### The Redirection Principle

It is much easier to redirect a child's impulse than to stop it completely. The child will not easily give up their new power word, but you can re-channel where and when they use it.

**The boundary**: Rude words are not to be used around other people because it is like an attack on someone else. If the child wants to say the word, they can do so:
- In private
- During Special Time

### Special Time as a Tool

**Special Time** is a recommended practice: every parent should spend at least ten minutes of Special Time with each child daily. This time is unstructured and serves to help the child process emotions and reconnect with the parent. It's particularly effective for supporting children through issues they're having.

For this swear word situation, tell the child: "I want to spend some special time with you for 15 minutes, and you can use any words you want to."

### Parent Preparation

Before the Special Time session, prepare yourself mentally so you don't get triggered. Use these reframing thoughts:
- Letting the child experiment this way will help them move past their fixation
- This is just a word
- It has no power beyond what you give it

You will likely still need to do conscious breathing to let yourself treat this shocking word as a game. That conscious effort is expected and necessary.

### How to Play the Swear Word Game

Remind the child that during Special Time, they can use any words they want. When they use their favorite word, make a game out of it that gives them an excuse to repeat the word over and over.

**Specific techniques**:
- Pretend you're hard of hearing and ask them to repeat themselves
- Keep your sense of humor and be playful
- The goal is to get the child laughing

When the child giggles about their powerful bad word, they are **discharging whatever tension and anxieties are driving them to keep using it**. These underlying anxieties might be:
- Anxieties about the person who taught them the word
- Issues about power struggles with the parent
- General preschooler anxieties

You don't need to know the specific cause to help the child work through it and move past the fixation.

**More techniques to keep the child laughing**:
- Play "the village idiot"
- Pretend to be "shocked, shocked, to find words like that being used here!"
- Have a mock shouting match, throwing your own nonsense words back at the child
- Be as silly as possible so the shouting match erupts into giggles

**Suggested nonsense words to shout back**: "Bumfuzzle!", "Supercalifragilistic!", "Snollygoster!"

**Practical tip**: If you think you might have trouble coming up with silly words in the moment, use Google beforehand and make a list. Post it near where you'll be playing with your child.

### What This Accomplishes

The swear word game achieves multiple goals simultaneously:
1. Lets the child play with the ability to shock the parent in a safe, controlled way
2. Supports the child to get it out of their system in a way that makes these kinds of words less enticing
3. Helps the child feel closer to the parent, making them more likely to respect requests about this and other things
4. Acknowledges that the child's interest in this powerful word, and power in general, is "normal" and doesn't make them a bad or unlovable person

The word will quickly seem tired and boring to the child when the parent repeatedly meets it with creative nonsense instead of shock or anger.

### Closing the Special Time Session

After 15 minutes of play, wind down with snuggles and kisses. Change the subject by:
- Reading a favorite book together
- Moving to a shared activity (making dinner, running the bath)

Once the child has regained equilibrium, explain: "That was a fun game, wasn't it? We can do this whenever you want, but except for special time, swear words are not allowed in our house. You can use them privately in your room if you need to say them, but you can't say them to other people because that will be perceived as an attack."

**Key condition for success**: As long as the child is allowed to feel powerful in their life and feels connected to the parent, they will want to follow the parent's guidance.

## Strategy 3: Eliminate the Power Struggle

### Why Preschoolers Use Swear Words and Potty Talk

Preschoolers typically use these words because they feel **anxious** about them. The laughter dispels the anxiety.

**Why the anxiety exists**:
- These words hold power in our culture
- Young children are anxious about many things - from whether they will make it to the bathroom on time to realizing that they and their parents will die someday

Additionally, preschoolers use swear words because they feel so **powerless** in life. These words are a way to get the upper hand with adults, even if only temporarily.

**This dynamic is especially strong in**:
- Strong-willed kids who more easily feel pushed around
- Kids whose parents are more controlling

### How to Respond Without Creating a Power Struggle

**Do not forbid the word's use** - you can't enforce such a prohibition anyway.

Instead, remind the child: "That word is rude and mean because it makes people uncomfortable. We don't use rude, mean words around others. You are in charge of choosing where to say such a word - you can go in the bathroom or into your bedroom. But it's not a word that can be used around other people."

**Offer the alternative**: "If you want to express frustrations, no problem - there's a whole list of great words on the fridge and I can help you read them to choose one."

### When the Child Tests the Boundary

If the child repeats the word to see what you'll do, **resist the bait**.

**Key principle**: "You don't have to attend every power struggle to which you're invited."

**Redirect to connection**: Say "What did you say? Did you say you need 100 kisses!?" Then grab the child and hug and kiss them.

This moves the interaction from a stand-off to a connecting, playful romp. It completely changes the tone, and the child will have little interest in the word at that point.

## Underlying Principles

### The Attention Economy of Parenting

Children repeat behaviors that get energy/attention from parents. This is why giving children positive energy and attention just for being themselves and cooperating is the most effective "disciplinary" strategy - they don't have to act up to get the parent's "juicy" attention.

### Forbidden Fruit Effect

Telling a child something is "bad" increases fascination rather than deterring the behavior. The prohibition itself creates allure.

### Power and Control

Preschoolers are in a developmental phase of exploring power. Finding a word that can shock adults gives them a sense of control in a life where they have very little. Rather than fighting this need for power, the effective approach is to channel it safely while maintaining connection.

### Connection as the Foundation of Cooperation

When children feel connected to their parents and feel powerful in their lives, they naturally want to follow parental guidance. The relationship, not the rule enforcement, is what produces cooperation.
