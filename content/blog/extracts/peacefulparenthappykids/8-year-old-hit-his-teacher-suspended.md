# Responding When a Child Hits a Teacher and Gets Suspended

## Core Framework: Understanding Before Correcting

When a child hits a teacher, the first and most important reframe is that the child is not a bad person. A child who resorts to hitting was clearly very upset - they must have felt scared, backed into a corner, like only violence would solve their problem. They didn't see any other way out. This understanding shapes the entire response: the goal is not punishment but helping the child develop better coping strategies while still maintaining clear limits.

## The Eight-Step Response Process

### Step 1: Start by Asking About What Happened

Begin by asking the child about what happened. Explore: What led up to it? What did the teacher do? What was he thinking and feeling at the time? The child probably doesn't even know how this happened - they just felt fear and rage, and lashed out. The purpose of this inquiry is not interrogation but understanding the child's internal experience.

### Step 2: Listen and Empathize

Empathize with the child's emotional state. Example language: "You must have been so upset." This validation creates safety for the child to reflect honestly rather than becoming defensive.

### Step 3: Set Clear Limits

After empathizing, establish clear limits: "Hitting is never okay, no matter what." The sequence matters - empathy first, then limits. This order ensures the child feels understood before hearing the boundary.

### Step 4: Ask About Consequences

Ask the child what they think resulted from this way of handling the problem. Guide them to recognize the costs: Teacher mad at them? Suspension? The child needs to see that there is a cost to their behavior. However, this is not shaming. Frame it as: "We all feel like hitting sometimes. But that solution costs us much more than we gain. It is never the best solution, no matter what." The distinction between natural consequences awareness and shame is critical.

### Step 5: Facilitate Repair

Ask the child how they can repair the situation. Concrete suggestions include: a letter of apology to the teacher and the principal. The broader question: What can they do to gain everyone's trust again? Repair is child-driven rather than imposed.

### Step 6: Productive Use of Suspension Time

The child should spend the time out of school working, not being entertained or punished:
- Writing a letter of apology to the teacher
- Studying for her class (and all classes) so they return to school caught up with work and poised to earn good grades
- No screen time or gaming

Importantly: use this time to connect with the child as much as possible. **Do not make it punishment. Make it a chance to earn back their good name.** This reframe transforms suspension from shame-inducing isolation into an opportunity for relationship building and restoration.

### Step 7: Problem Solve for Future Situations

Explore: If a similar situation ever happens again, how can they handle it? Would that approach have different results? Then **practice that solution so the child's subconscious has an alternative to violence.** Mental rehearsal creates new neural pathways that can be accessed in future moments of stress.

### Step 8: Empower and Inspire

This step happens not immediately but through ongoing conversations. The goal is ensuring the child's takeaway is positive.

**Warning: Many kids react to a suspension with shame, which just makes their behavior worse.** Shame creates a negative identity that becomes self-fulfilling.

**Reframe using the "universe's message" metaphor:** Tell the child that the universe taps you on the shoulder to tell you about changes you need to make in your life. If you don't make those changes, the universe often increases the volume of the warning, and slugs you. So this suspension was that slug - a wake-up call to change things. Ask: How can they use it positively to turn things around in their life? This transforms a punishment into a growth opportunity.

## Parent Responsibility and Systemic Considerations

Beyond the immediate response, parents must take responsibility that something is really wrong if an eight-year-old is resorting to hitting to solve problems. This is a signal requiring deeper intervention.

**Priority actions for parents:**
- Consider family counseling
- Heal any stresses in the child's life that are making them lash out
- Help the child develop anger management skills
- Address any ongoing issues making it hard for the child to manage impulses (such as anxiety)
- Ensure discipline consists of clear, firm limits but never hitting

The final point highlights a critical consistency requirement: parents cannot use hitting as discipline while expecting children not to hit. Modeling matters.

## Key Principles Underlying the Framework

**Empathy before correction:** The sequence of empathize first, set limits second appears throughout. This isn't permissiveness - clear limits still exist. But the child needs to feel understood before they can truly hear and integrate the limit.

**Natural consequences over imposed punishment:** Rather than adding punishments, help the child see the natural consequences of their actions (damaged relationships, loss of trust, suspension). This creates genuine motivation to change.

**Identity protection:** The framework consistently protects the child's identity as a good person who made a mistake, rather than a bad person. Shame worsens behavior; understanding enables change.

**Active skill-building:** Simply telling a child not to hit is insufficient. They need practiced alternatives - actual mental rehearsal of different responses - so their subconscious has something to access when flooded with emotion.

**Repair as restoration:** Apology letters and rebuilding trust aren't punishment but opportunities to restore the child's good name and relationships. The child is empowered to take action rather than passively receiving consequences.
