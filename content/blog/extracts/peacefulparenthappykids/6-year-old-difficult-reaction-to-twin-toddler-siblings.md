# Helping an Older Child Adjust When Younger Siblings Demand More Attention

## Understanding the Behavioral Pattern

When an older child suddenly becomes difficult after younger siblings arrive (or become more demanding), the behaviors often include:

- **Regression signals**: Wishing to be a baby again, using baby voice, seeking to return to an earlier developmental stage
- **Hyperactivity and attention-seeking**: Being loud, getting "in your face" during family interactions, constantly seeking the spotlight
- **Testing limits**: Pushing boundaries during one-on-one time, provoking parental anger especially at the end of otherwise positive experiences
- **Pervasive complaints**: Finding fault with meals, hair brushing, activities - nothing seems good enough
- **Uncooperativeness**: Resisting routine requests like picking up toys, brushing teeth, getting ready for bed
- **Emotional hunger masquerading as physical hunger**: Constant requests for snacks that may actually represent a need for emotional nourishment rather than calories
- **Different behavior at school vs. home**: Acting wonderfully at school while being difficult at home, because home feels safe enough to express true feelings

## The Root Cause: Feeling Unlovable

The core insight is that **children who act unlovable typically feel unlovable**. The difficult behavior is not defiance but a signal of internal distress.

When children have angry or jealous thoughts about their siblings (even while also loving them), they often feel guilty about those thoughts. This guilt leads to a cycle:
1. Child has "mean" thoughts about siblings
2. Child feels like a monster for having those thoughts
3. Child acts out and provokes punishment
4. Punishment confirms to the child that they are bad
5. The cycle reinforces itself

The emotional logic: If I'm already a bad person for my thoughts, I might as well act like one. And if my parents punish me, at least that confirms what I already believe about myself.

## Why the Testing Behavior at the End of Special Time

A critical pattern: When parents finally do spend one-on-one time with the child, the child often "ruins it" by pushing limits at the very end. This is not ingratitude or manipulation.

What's actually happening: The child finally feels safe enough to let their guard down. The approaching end of special time triggers all their fears about losing the parent again. The "testing" is actually an attempt to access the deeper feelings that have been locked inside.

The child is unconsciously seeking an opportunity to cry, rage, and release the emotions they've been suppressing. They create conflict because conflict leads to emotional release.

## The Danger of Suppressed Feelings

If children must hide their negative feelings about siblings:
- They will feel like a monster for having those feelings
- They will act like a monster as a result
- The feelings don't disappear, they just go underground
- Underground feelings drive more problematic behavior

**The feelings exist regardless of whether we acknowledge them.** The only question is whether they get expressed safely or acted out destructively.

## Framework for Healing the Relationship

### Step 1: Internal Work - Shifting Your Perspective

Before changing any behavior, parents need to reconnect emotionally with their child. This requires dedicated reflection time (approximately 30 minutes alone).

**The ritual process:**
1. Light a candle as a symbolic gesture
2. Ask for help (from whatever source feels meaningful - God, highest self, power of love) to heal the relationship
3. Deliberately see the child's life from their perspective

**Perspective-taking exercise:**
- Notice how much more time you spend with the younger children
- Remember the child is only 6 (or whatever age) and still desperately needs you
- Consider how hard they work to "keep it together" during school all day
- Recognize their secret wish to have you to themselves, even though they love their siblings
- See past the annoying behavior to the fear underneath: fear of being displaced, fear of being a terrible person for their angry feelings

**Visualization:**
- See your child growing up and blossoming with you cheering them on
- Visualize the close relationship you could have at each stage of life
- Feel gratitude for having this child

**Self-compassion component:**
- Acknowledge that parenting toddler twins (or multiple young children) is extremely hard work
- Recognize that giving an older child what they need at the same time is "almost superhuman"
- Don't judge yourself for struggling

### Step 2: Allow the Full Range of Feelings

**The principle:** Children are allowed to have ALL their feelings, even the ugly ones. They are NOT allowed to act on those feelings in harmful ways.

**What this looks like in practice:**
- The child can say "I wish the babies were never born"
- The parent responds with empathy: "Sometimes you wish you were my only baby, don't you?"
- The child learns they can have dark feelings and still be loved
- This makes the child feel less like a monster
- Feeling less like a monster, they act less like one

**Critical distinction:** Accepting feelings is not the same as accepting harmful behavior. The child can never treat siblings badly. But they can express their anger and jealousy verbally.

### Step 3: Daily Special Time with Built-in Buffer

**Structure:** Commit to special mommy/daughter (or daddy/daughter) time every single day.

**Critical rule:** Maintain ONLY positivity during this time, no matter what testing the child does. When children test, it is the parent's job to rise above it and maintain cheerfulness and empathy while still setting limits.

**What to do during special time:**
- Play games that affirm your adoration of the child
- Avoid practical tasks like homework or hair washing
- Focus entirely on connection

**The buffer strategy:** Build in extra time at the end to handle the expected meltdown.
- Tell the child you have 10 minutes for Special Time
- Be prepared to spend an extra 20 minutes on emotional release afterward
- Total actual commitment: 30 minutes

**Handling the end-of-special-time meltdown:**
1. Set the limit calmly and kindly: "We have to stop our Special Time now"
2. Stay with the child when they tantrum
3. Empathize: "It makes you so upset that I have to stop being with you now... it is so hard to have to share me all the time"
4. Don't be defensive
5. Let them offload their feelings
6. After the release, the child will feel better and more cooperative

### Step 4: Constant Unsolicited Love and Warmth

Don't wait for the child to ask for affection or seek attention. Proactively offer:
- Love
- Warmth
- Tenderness

**Specific practice:** Constantly find the child doing something right. Express ongoing gratitude for their patience in a situation where younger children inevitably take precedence.

This counteracts the child's internal narrative that they are bad and unworthy of love.

### Step 5: Don't Take Anger Personally

When the child finds fault with dinner, hair brushing, activities, etc., look past the surface complaint to the deeper meaning.

**The translation:** "I didn't like that dinner" often means "I wish you loved me better."

**Response approach:** Rather than defending yourself or getting irritated, address the underlying need:
- Hug the child
- Say: "I hear you didn't like [specific thing] and I wonder if maybe you wish I loved you better. But I want you to know that I love you completely, no matter what!"

### Step 6: Don't Shame the Child About Their Needs

**What to avoid:** "You're not the only person in this family who needs me" - this shames the child for having needs and increases their fear of being less important than siblings.

**Better approach:** Acknowledge their need, acknowledge the competing need, affirm their importance, and include them in the solution.

**Example script:** "I hear you need me right now. The twins need me right now too. It must be frustrating that I always have to tend to them first because they're babies, but I want you to know that you are just as important to me as they are, and I want to help you with what you need. Come with me to get the twins settled, and then we will take care of what you need."

This accomplishes several things:
- Validates the child's need
- Explains (without shaming) why siblings get attended to first
- Explicitly states equal importance
- Offers inclusion rather than exclusion
- Provides a concrete timeline for when their need will be met

### Step 7: Help Verbalize Emotions

**Purpose:** When children can name their feelings, they gain more control over them and feel less shame.

**Methods:**
- Draw the child out about feelings toward siblings
- Offer empathy when they share
- Read library books about new babies and little siblings as a conversation starter
- Explicitly normalize having negative feelings about siblings while also loving them

**The message to convey:** "You are loved no matter what, and it is normal to feel some negativity toward your siblings even though you also love them."

## Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Yelling in response to testing behavior** - This confirms the child's belief that they are bad and completes the punitive cycle they unconsciously sought

2. **Taking bait when the child provokes** - The child needs you to stay calm and loving precisely when they are being most difficult

3. **Defending yourself against complaints** - Misses the emotional message behind the surface complaint

4. **Shaming statements about needs** - "Other people need me too" increases fear and jealousy rather than reducing it

5. **Using special time for practical tasks** - Hair washing and homework don't build connection; save special time for pure play

6. **Ending special time abruptly without buffer** - Sets up failure; the meltdown will happen, so plan for it

7. **Requiring the child to suppress negative feelings about siblings** - Suppression leads to acting out; expression leads to healing

## The Deeper Frame

This situation is described as "the hardest part of motherhood - and, ultimately, the most rewarding."

The parent is being asked to find a deeper love for their child - a love that sees past difficult behavior to the frightened child underneath, and responds with patience and empathy rather than frustration and anger.

This growth in the parent's capacity to love is both what the child needs to flourish and what will heal the relationship.

## Timeline Considerations

The fact that twins are 18 months old when the older child's behavior changes is significant. At 18 months, toddlers become more demanding, mobile, and attention-consuming. The older child may have managed the adjustment initially but is now hitting a wall as the twins require even more parental bandwidth.

This is a normal reaction, even if the timing seems delayed. The adjustment period for becoming a big sibling can unfold over months or years, not just the initial weeks after birth.
