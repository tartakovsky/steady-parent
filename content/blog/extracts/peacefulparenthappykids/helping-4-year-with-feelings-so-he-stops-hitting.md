## Core Framework: The Five Steps to Help a Child Who Hits

The approach distinguishes sharply between **helping with feelings** and **teaching**. These are separate processes that must happen at different times. Conflating them undermines both. The five steps are:

1. **Prevent hitting** if possible
2. **Set clear, firm, kind limits** when hitting occurs
3. **Help with feelings** after hitting (or before, if you catch the buildup)
4. **Stay very connected daily** so the child trusts you with feelings
5. **Teach** that hitting is not okay - but only hours later, when everyone is calm

The critical insight is that a child who hits already knows hitting is wrong. The problem is not knowledge but emotional regulation. The child cannot stop himself because he is overwhelmed by feelings he cannot bear. Therefore, steps 1-4 are far more important than step 5. Teaching (step 5) is the least essential part of the process.

## Why Children Hit: The Underlying Mechanism

**Aggression in mammals always comes from fear.** A child who lashes out is experiencing unbearable upset feelings. He gets over-stimulated, disconnected from his parent, and feels alone and terrified. He cannot bear those feelings, so he lashes out.

The hitting is a symptom, not the core problem. The core problem is a backpack full of stored-up feelings the child has been carrying around. These feelings push him toward hitting. Once he feels those feelings fully and releases them, they will vanish, and he will be more able to manage his behavior.

Children may have accumulated these feelings from various sources: having a sibling, past discipline methods, a difficult birth, or simply being highly sensitive. The specific origin does not need to be identified for the healing process to work.

## Step 1: Prevent Hitting

Stay very close when the child is with other kids. Physical proximity allows you to intervene before hitting escalates.

---

## Step 2: Set Clear, Firm, Kind Limits

When the child hits, intervene immediately and definitively.

**How to set the limit:**
- Get down on the child's level
- Put your hand on his arm or back (gently but firmly to make contact)
- Make eye contact
- Say clearly: "I know you're upset but NO HITTING!"

**What NOT to say:** "I just want to talk to you for a moment" - this is too soft and unclear. The limit needs to be immediate and unambiguous.

**Firm versus Mean:** Firm is good. Mean is not. You will naturally feel angry when your child hits. This anger needs to be managed so you can stay kind.

## Managing Your Own Anger as a Parent

Behind your anger there is fear. Fear that something is wrong with your child, or that you are a bad parent, or that he will become a terrible person. None of these fears are true. But you need to let that fear come up and feel it so it is exposed to the light of day. Then it will shrivel up and blow away, and you will be better able to help your child.

**Two strategies for managing parental emotions:**

1. **Talk to others about your feelings.** Vent, or write in a journal. You need to process your own upsets and fears. Important caveat: Do not talk to people who will reinforce your fears by getting scared themselves and telling you to take action. You need a listener, not someone who amplifies your anxiety.

2. **See it from the child's perspective.** He is a very little person who is easily overwhelmed. He is afraid. He gets over-stimulated and disconnected and feels alone and terrified. If you can understand and accept this, you will feel more sympathy for him. Let him into your heart.

## Step 3: Help with Feelings - The Core Process

This is NOT a verbal process. It is NOT about teaching or talking. It is about safety.

**The goal:** Give the child a safe "holding environment" to feel his feelings. If he feels safe with you, when feelings come up, he will feel them and show them to you. Once emotions are felt, they evaporate.

**Why talking does not help:** When humans are upset, learning shuts down. Teaching moves the child out of his heart and into his mind. Telling him what he did wrong does not help him feel safe. It puts up a wall and makes him defensive.

### What to Do When the Child Is Upset

**Remove from the situation:** Take the child out of the playground or away from the conflict. This gives privacy. But do not think of it as taking him out "to talk with him." You are taking him out to help him with his feelings.

**Stay close:** Even if he runs away from you. He has upset feelings and when you connect with him, he has to acknowledge those feelings. The whole reason he lashed out is that his fear was unbearable. He does not want to feel all that, so he runs.

**Let the child regulate distance:** If he moves away, he is trying to regulate the space between you. Say: "I won't come any closer than this until you're ready, but I am right here." Do not restrain him physically. Stay as near as he will let you. He will not run too far.

**Do not walk away in frustration:** When you walk away, that communicates frustration and anger, which scares him. He needs you close to feel safe, even though being too close makes feelings come up more intensely.

**Minimal talking:** Say only enough to stay connected and help him feel safe. Use phrases like:
- "You are so upset..."
- "I am right here..."
- "You are safe..."
- "I won't leave you alone with these big scary feelings."

Say these in as soothing a tone as you can muster, every so often. Do not say too much.

**What NOT to say during feelings:** Do not teach. Do not correct. Do not tell him what he did wrong. He cannot listen right now. It will make things worse because he will stop feeling safe.

### When the Child Becomes Hysterical

Hysterical, out-of-control crying is a good thing. It means he feels safe enough to let all his fear out. He might also thrash around, which is also fear coming up.

This is the healing process. These feelings are what has been pushing him to hit. He has been carrying them around for a long time. Once he feels them, they will vanish. He will be more able to manage his feelings and therefore his behavior.

**Ten minutes of crying is great. Twenty minutes is even better.** Keep going for as long as you can stay kind and patient.

**During car rides:** In the car, the child is not feeling connected to you, which interrupts his healing. Try to sit with the feelings for as long as you can before leaving. Keep breathing. Say a mantra to yourself: "He's getting out all that fear... he's healing... we're on the right track."

**If possible, hold him. If not, touch him. If that is not possible, stay with him and keep connected using your voice.**

### After the Crying - Transitioning Out

After expressing big feelings, children worry about whether you still love them. One reason they held those feelings in is that they thought the feelings were not acceptable.

**Snuggling is very important.** Hold him and tell him you love him no matter what, forever and ever.

Say: "You were so upset. Thank you for showing me all those big feelings. I am right here, no matter what. I will always keep you safe."

**First words after the cuddle** should be a reflection of his feelings: "You were so upset... you were crying so hard."

**Then affirm safety and love:** "I love you and I will always keep you safe." Keep repeating versions of this.

**Brief acknowledgment of the hitting:** You can say "You hit that boy in the face. That hurt!" But then drop it. His brain is not fully in gear yet.

**If you lecture, you will get a blank stare.** That blank stare is a defense mechanism. The child thinks: "Mom says what I did was bad... but I couldn't help myself... I must be bad... what if she stops loving me because I am so bad?" That fear causes the defensive shutdown.

**Moving on:** When it seems clear he is done processing and ready to move on, ask if he wants a drink of water. Wash your own and his face and hands. This helps put the incident behind you.

## Step 4: Stay Connected Daily

Do this through warmth, touch, snuggling, and physical games.

### Special Time

Ten minutes every single day. Announce that you are all his for ten minutes with no interruptions.

**Alternate days:**
- One day: his choice - play whatever game he wants, do it his way
- Next day: your choice - play physical games that involve connection and power and help him work on his fear

**What to aim for:** Anything that gets him giggling. Giggling releases the same feelings as crying, so the more giggling, the fewer tears needed later.

**Why this works:** This daily special time builds trust so the child will be more able to let his feelings up and out rather than running away from you. It makes him more willing to rely on you to help him feel safe - for instance, to call you for help instead of hitting.

---

## Step 5: Teaching - Only Hours Later

Wait at least two hours after an incident, until everyone is calm again. You cannot teach when either of you is upset.

**The child already knows not to hit.** He just cannot stop himself. So the other four steps are much more important - they help him actually act the way he knows he should.

### How to Teach Effectively

**Do it with a light touch and a sense of humor.**

**Start by asking, not telling:** "Remember at the park when you hit that little boy? Remember how upset he was? That hurt him. Right? Do you know why you hit?"

**Listen and reflect:** "You were mad at him?... Tell me more..."

Be kind enough that he trusts you to answer truthfully. Really listen. You may get valuable information, and he might actually learn something. But this requires genuinely empathizing, not lecturing.

**Explore alternatives together:** "Next time, when you get mad, what could you do? Could you call me? Could you walk away? Could you hit the sand?"

**Practice with role-play to build muscle memory:** "Ok, let's practice. This stuffed animal tried to use your truck. You are so mad and want to hit him. But you remember there are other things you can do! So you call me, ok? I am right over here talking to another mom. Call me, ok, and I will come. Call me right now."

This creates muscle memory so the child has practiced responses available in the moment.

## Understanding Meltdowns

### What Meltdowns Indicate

All young children have big feelings. Every child sometimes engages in "off-track" behavior caused by feelings he cannot manage. That is how he shows us he needs help with his feelings.

A child who is having a hard time consistently is showing us he has a backpack full of stored-up feelings. A child who gets anxious and over-stimulated around peers and lashes out has pent-up feelings to release.

### Scheduled Meltdowns

We do scheduled meltdowns when we can handle it, but in response to off-track behavior. We set a kind, clear limit and offer a safe place to cry. The child may think he is crying about the limit, but he gets a chance to off-load those upset feelings that were driving his off-track behavior.

### How Many Meltdowns to Expect

If the child is getting regular opportunities to giggle, play, and connect with parents, plus empathy for his feelings, he might be doing fine. In that case, he will be sunny and cooperative most of the time and may only need one meltdown when something comes up. But he may need another one next week - kids have lots of big feelings to process.

A child with a lot of stored-up feelings may need many meltdowns. Expect a lot of meltdowns for the next month. Kids sometimes have daily meltdowns for many months, particularly if they have had past trauma or medical issues.

**The trajectory:** As the child feels more connected to you and shows you his big feelings more and more, he will be more able to stop himself from hitting. Not every time, but more and more often.

## Case Study: Intensive Meltdown Period

One parent reported their child (nearing age 4) was having 5 big meltdowns a day plus many small ones. Examples included:

1. Wanting a second treat after agreeing to just one - becoming violent (clawing, kicking, trying to bite)
2. Being told to pick up a chair, refusing, then melting down when parent picked it up because he wanted to do it
3. Father getting dressed in the morning - child screaming at father to take his trousers off, over and over like a "screaming mantra"
4. Agreeing to get out of shower when timer goes off, then melting down when timer actually goes off

### Interpretation

The child is almost looking for things to have meltdowns about. This indicates he is off-loading a full backpack of stored-up feelings. The empathizing has done such a good job that he now feels safe expressing his feelings.

This is temporary. It is actually a healing of old hurts. The more the parent can simply love him while he is having meltdowns, the faster he will get it all out and move on.

**Why the child is over-reacting:** He has reasons to be upset that we do not know about. And he is over-reacting precisely because he needs to cry.

**What to do:** Be as compassionate as possible to this little person who has such big hurts stored up inside. You do not even need words. Just occasionally tell him you see how upset he is, that you are right there, and he is safe. The more present you are, the harder he will cry. But then, the more you will see positive change in his behavior afterward.

### Developmental Context

Being almost four can be really hard. Children hate having so little control. Anything you can let him control is a good thing. Giving choices is helpful.

## Common Mistakes and Anti-Patterns

### Confusing Teaching with Helping Feelings

The most common error is trying to teach or talk when the child is upset. This causes:
- The child to stop feeling safe
- Defensive shutdown (the "blank stare")
- A wall between parent and child
- No actual learning (learning shuts down when upset)

### Talking Too Much During Feelings

When feelings come up, minimal words are needed. Talking moves the child out of his heart and into his mind, which interrupts the healing process.

### Walking Away in Frustration

This communicates anger to the child, which scares him. Even if he is running away, he needs you close. Let him regulate the distance, but do not leave.

### Lecturing After the Meltdown

Even after the crying stops, the brain is not fully in gear yet. Lecturing at this point creates the "I can sit here all day mum, you're not going to break me" standoff. It is pointless and harmful.

### Making the Child Feel Like a Bad Person

Telling the child that what he did was bad will backfire because it scares him. He thinks: "I couldn't help myself... I must be bad... what if mom stops loving me?" This fear increases, not decreases, the hitting.

### Physical Restraint

Restraining the child physically usually upsets him more. Let him regulate the distance between you. Stay as near as he will let you.

### Interrupting Crying to Go Home

In the car, the child is not feeling connected, which interrupts healing. Sit with the feelings as long as you can before leaving.

## Key Phrases to Use

**When setting limits:**
- "I know you're upset but NO HITTING!"
- "I won't let you hit, Sweetie."

**When staying close during feelings:**
- "You are so upset..."
- "I am right here..."
- "You are safe..."
- "I won't leave you alone with these big scary feelings."
- "I won't come any closer than this until you're ready, but I am right here."

**After the crying:**
- "You were so upset. Thank you for showing me all those big feelings."
- "I am right here, no matter what. I will always keep you safe."
- "I love you and I will always keep you safe."
- "You were so upset... you were crying so hard."

**During teaching (hours later):**
- "Remember at the park when you hit that little boy? Remember how upset he was? That hurt him. Right? Do you know why you hit?"
- "You were mad at him?... Tell me more..."
- "Next time, when you get mad, what could you do? Could you call me? Could you walk away? Could you hit the sand?"

## Signs of Progress

- Child becomes gentler with siblings, shows more love and affection
- Meltdowns become less frequent over time
- Child is more able to stop himself from hitting (not every time, but more and more often)
- Child feels safe expressing feelings directly rather than acting them out through hitting

---

## Parent Self-Care

This process is tough. Parents need to breathe through the child's big feelings. If the parent were comfortable with the feelings, the child would probably be more comfortable with them too.

**Strategies:**
- Journal writing to get out your own feelings
- Talk to supportive listeners (not advice-givers who will amplify fears)
- Keep breathing during meltdowns
- Use mantras: "He's getting out all that fear... he's healing... we're on the right track"
- Visualize yourself in a positive state - holding your child, being understanding, generous of spirit, loving. The more you see and practice it, the more you will feel it.

Unconditional love is just as essential to the child's learning as the limits you set on his hitting. The teaching is what is less essential.
