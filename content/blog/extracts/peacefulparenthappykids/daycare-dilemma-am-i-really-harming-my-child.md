# Daycare Stress and Young Children: When to Intervene

## Core Research on Daycare and Cortisol

**Children under 36 months old often find full-day daycare stressful**, as measured by elevated cortisol levels compared to children who stay home during the day. This finding comes from meta-analyses of daycare studies.

However, this research finding is not a blanket indictment of daycare. Several factors significantly moderate the stress response:

**Quality of care matters.** Warm and nurturing caregivers reduce stress for children. Children who have better relationships with their teachers do not show the same worrisome cortisol changes that many kids in full-time daycare exhibit (Badanes et al., 2012).

**Starting age matters.** There is encouraging evidence for children who start daycare at age two rather than earlier.

**Genetics matter.** Research shows that genetic differences influence which children are more stressed in daycare settings (Tucker-Drob et al., 2013). Some children do fine regardless of the setting, while others are more susceptible to stress in group care environments.

## The Key Indicator: Is the Child Thriving?

If a child is thriving in daycare, the general research findings about cortisol become less relevant for that individual child. The critical question is not "what does research say about daycare in general" but "how is my specific child doing?"

**Warning signs that a child is not adapting well:**

- Crying a lot throughout the day (not just at separation)
- Continuing to cry frequently after a month of attendance
- Unable to be quickly comforted by a caregiver after separation
- New anxious behaviors appearing outside of daycare (pulling sleeves, sucking on clothing)
- Regression in previously mastered skills (like being comfortable at grandparents' house)

**Normal adjustment vs. concerning patterns:**

- It makes sense that a child still cries at the moment of separation after a month
- However, if the child is bonded to a staff member, they should be able to go to that person and be comforted quickly, stopping crying fairly soon after the parent leaves
- Crying on and off all day, especially during transitions, suggests the child does not feel safe and bonded

## The Critical Factor: A Special Person

**All little ones need one special person looking out for them** at daycare. This is not optional - it is essential for the child to feel safe.

The problem in the case study was revealing: the child had bonded with someone in administration who was not always available. During nap time, the two regular educators would go on break and two new people would come in. This made it very hard for the child to be comforted or to feel secure.

**Practical implication:** When evaluating daycare, ask whether one specific staffer can be appointed to bond with your child. Consistent caregiver assignment is crucial for young children's sense of safety.

## When the Current Arrangement Is Not Working: Alternative Approaches

**A hybrid solution** can give children the benefits of daycare (time with other kids, routine, activities) while reducing stress:

- Child attends daycare in the morning only
- A trusted family member picks the child up after lunch
- Child naps at home
- After waking (around 3pm), the child has cozy down time with the family member

This approach provides:
- Socialization with other children
- Connection with a loved one during the potentially stressful afternoon hours
- Time to unwind after a stimulating morning
- Avoiding the nap transition, which is often when staff changes occur

## After a Difficult Daycare Experience: Helping the Child Recover

When a child develops anxiety from a daycare experience that did not feel safe, specific play-based interventions can help them work through the anxiety.

**Games that elicit laughter** are therapeutic because laughter helps children process and release anxiety. Recommended games:

- **Peek-a-boo** - classic game that plays with the concept of presence and absence
- **Hide and seek** - lets the child experience temporary separation with a happy reunion
- **Playing bye-bye without actually leaving** - the parent acts too scared to leave the child (in a silly way, not a pathetic way). This reversal of roles, where the parent is the "scared" one, gives the child a sense of power over the separation anxiety

**The key principle:** Any laughter helps. The specific game matters less than getting the child to laugh, which releases tension and helps process the anxiety about feeling alone.

## Summary of Decision Framework

1. Research shows daycare can be stressful for children under 36 months, but this is highly individual
2. Watch your specific child's behavior, not just research averages
3. If the child is thriving -> do not worry about the general research
4. If the child is crying frequently throughout the day after a month -> investigate further
5. Check whether the child has one consistent person to bond with
6. Consider hybrid solutions (mornings only) if full-day is too much
7. If you pull a child from an unsuccessful daycare, use laughter-inducing games to help them recover from the anxiety
