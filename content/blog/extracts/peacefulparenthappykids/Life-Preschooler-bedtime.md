## Core Understanding: Why Preschoolers Struggle with Bedtime

**The 99% reality**: While some assume preschoolers should be able to put themselves to bed, the vast majority of children five and under (roughly 99%) require substantial support to fall asleep. This includes a couple hours of calming downtime before bed, dinner at home, and a full bedtime routine with storytime and snuggling.

**Three factors determine whether a parent can leave the room** and let the child fall asleep independently:
1. Whether the child is naturally inclined to fall asleep easily on their own (some children are simply wired this way)
2. Whether the child has been taught to put themselves to sleep through a deliberate process
3. Whether the child is relaxed versus carrying a "full backpack" of pent-up stress and emotions from their day

The emotional backpack metaphor is important: children accumulate small fears and upsets throughout their day. When they close their eyes at night, feelings they have been fending off during the day can suddenly overwhelm them, making them too anxious to settle into sleep.

**Biological normalcy**: It is completely normal from a biological standpoint for three and four year olds to sleep cuddled up with a parent or sibling. Many preschoolers wake up at night, and many spend all or part of most nights in their parents' beds. There is no shame in this if it matches the family's preference.

## The 10 Strategies for Getting Preschoolers to Stay in Bed

### 1. Create Safety

**The underlying problem**: Young children having fears and worries is completely normal. While parents know the child is safe in bed, the child does not necessarily feel that way. They are little people in a big, scary world, and without a parent present to protect them, they can easily feel frightened alone in the dark.

**Why the bedtime routine creates safety**: The routine helps children feel safe because it is exactly the same each night, so they know what to expect. The routine also includes lots of soothing physical contact with the parent.

**The reassurance they need**: Even if you think your child should already know they are safe, they still need explicit reassurance. Tell them you are very close by and that you will see them in the morning. They may cognitively understand this, but they still need to hear it.

### 2. Regulate Your Own Emotions

**The natural reaction and why it backfires**: It is natural to feel frustrated when you just want your child to sleep. However, yelling at the child will make them feel less safe, which directly undermines your efforts to help them enjoy settling into bed.

**Prepare yourself in advance**: Parents should prepare themselves before bedtime so they can stay in a good mood rather than losing their temper. Expect that children will resist the "forced separation" of bedtime because that resistance is their job. The parent's job is to stay cheerful, patient, and clear about the limit that yes, it is still bedtime.

### 3. Use Play Earlier in the Evening to Diminish Anxiety

**Timing matters**: Do not wait until bedtime to address anxiety. Earlier in the evening (after dinner is fine), help your child work through anxieties through roughhousing that gets the child laughing for about ten minutes.

**Types of play that work**:
- Let the child be a scary monster while you act frightened in a goofy, exaggerated way
- Be a "bucking bronco" and get the child laughing out their fears indirectly

**Why laughter works**: The physical play and laughter help discharge the fears and anxieties that have built up during the day, so they do not resurface at bedtime.

**Critical warning**: Do not do roughhousing right before bed because it will wind the child up. After the physical play, follow with a bath and story to calm down before sleep.

### 4. Addressing Monster Fears

**Why fears persist despite rational arguments**: All kids build up an emotional backpack of small fears and upsets throughout their day. Fears are not rational, so offering rational arguments will not help and the child will stay frightened.

**What NOT to do**: Do not ridicule, shame, or offer logical explanations for why monsters are not real. These approaches fail because they do not address the fear on the emotional level where it exists.

**The correct response pattern**: Listen and acknowledge the fear first. Say something like: "I hear you're worried about monsters... That can be scary... Let's do something about that."

**Monster Spray technique**: Create a spray bottle with lavender and water. Some people add glitter, and glycerin will keep the glitter suspended in the bottle to make it more magical. Label the bottle with something powerful like: "Do not use around monsters. Will make monsters disappear."

**Alternative technique - sweeping out monsters**: Get a broom and sweep the monsters out of the closet together. Put them in the trash can and take it out of the child's room.

**Why these approaches work**: They respond on the level of the fear rather than just denying it. The child feels empowered to take action against what frightens them.

**The tone to strike**: Be light about the whole process, not grim. Communicate to your child that this is not an emergency but rather a small challenge you can support them to solve. Talk to the monsters in a powerful way that puts them in their place: "Monsters aren't allowed in Samantha's bedroom... You monsters know better than this... Time to go now!"

### 5. Teach Relaxation Techniques

**Individual differences**: Just as some adults have a harder time getting to sleep at night, so do some children. This is a matter of temperament and wiring.

**Techniques that help different children**:
- Music for some kids
- Guided meditation that teaches them to breathe deeply
- Teaching the child to inhale deeply and then exhale slowly and fully, which downshifts the body's alert systems

**Body-part relaxation technique**: Touch each part of your child's body in turn, saying good night to it. Have the child take a deep breath in, and as they breathe out, imagine that the part of their body you are touching melts into relaxation. This technique is described as very effective.

### 6. Make the Bed Feel Cozy and Safe

**The principle**: Kids will settle better in a bed where they feel safe and secure.

**What helps**: A toddler bed low to the ground, or a single mattress on the floor, with a partial rail. The rail and low position help them feel secure and contained.

**What can cause restlessness**: A bed high off the ground or a double bed. These can make kids feel less secure and therefore more restless.

### 7. Offer to Check On Her

**The technique**: Tell your child you will come look in on her in five minutes, and then again in five more minutes. Tell her you will not say anything, just come check. Then follow through - pause in the door briefly.

**Why it works**: The child will probably be waiting for you to come and will notice your presence. This helps her feel secure, and that security might be all she needs to settle into sleep.

**Long-term trajectory**: You can gradually ease out of this habit once the child feels secure enough to fall asleep without the check-ins.

### 8. Prevent the Getting-Up Habit from Forming

**The prevention approach**: If your child gets up, be matter of fact but boring as you return them to bed. Say: "It's time to sleep... I will be right here... you are safe in your bed."

**Why "boring" matters**: If getting up results in interesting interaction or emotional engagement, it reinforces the behavior. Keeping the response flat and uninteresting removes the reward.

**If the habit is already established**: Use a more structured process for helping your child learn to fall asleep (the article references a separate Toddlers and Sleep resource for step-by-step guidance).

### 9. Drawing Out Fears for Persistent Night-Time Anxiety

**When to use this**: If your child is afraid night after night, not just occasionally.

**The technique**: Encourage the child to draw what they are afraid of. This helps the child master the fear by externalizing it and giving them control over the representation.

**Taking it further**: Help the child talk to the monster or whatever they draw. Have them say something like: "No monsters allowed in my room. You have to sleep outside our house!"

### 10. The "Get Out of Bed Free" Card

**The technique**: Give your child one "Get Out of Bed Free" card every night. They can use it that night, or save it for when they really need it.

**Why it works**: It reassures the child that if they really need to go find you, they can. This reduces anxiety because the option exists. The paradox is that many kids prefer to save these cards rather than use them, which stops the habit of getting up. Having the permission seems to reduce the compulsion to use it.

## Key Insights and Principles

**Match the intervention to the level of the problem**: Fears are emotional, not rational. Interventions must respond on the emotional level (empowerment, physical comfort, play) rather than the cognitive level (explanations, arguments).

**Timing of interventions matters**: Address anxiety earlier in the day through play, not at bedtime. Physical activity close to bedtime winds children up rather than calming them down.

**The parent's emotional state directly affects the child's ability to settle**: If the parent becomes frustrated and yells, the child feels less safe, which makes falling asleep harder. Managing your own emotions is not just about being a "good parent" - it is strategically necessary for the bedtime goal.

**Security is the foundation**: Multiple strategies (consistent routine, reassurance, checking in, cozy bed environment, handling fears) all converge on the same goal of helping the child feel secure enough to let go and fall asleep.

**Preschoolers have an advantage over toddlers**: The article notes that preschoolers find it easier to learn to fall asleep without their parents than toddlers do. If you have been struggling and waiting, this is encouraging - the developmental trajectory is in your favor.

## What to Avoid

- **Yelling or showing frustration** at the child (makes them feel less safe)
- **Rational arguments against fears** (fears are not rational, so logic does not address them)
- **Ridiculing or shaming** the child for their fears
- **Roughhousing right before bed** (winds children up instead of calming them down)
- **Making the return-to-bed interaction interesting** (reinforces the getting-up behavior)
- **Expecting children to handle bedtime independently** before they are developmentally ready (the 99% reality)
- **Skipping the bedtime routine** (children need the predictability and physical contact to feel safe)
