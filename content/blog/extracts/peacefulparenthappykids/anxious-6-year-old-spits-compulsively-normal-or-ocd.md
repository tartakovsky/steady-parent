## The Case: Compulsive Spitting Triggered by "Grossness" and Nervousness

A nearly six-year-old girl developed a compulsive need to spit in response to two distinct triggers:

1. **Disgust reactions** - seeing toothpaste on toothbrushes, junk drawers full of stuff, messy dressers
2. **Nervousness** - such as after performing violin for grandparents (she had accumulated a mouthful of spit during the performance)

The behavior occurs several times daily. The child also displays another anxiety indicator: when getting wound up telling or drawing imaginary stories, she needs to hold a "stick" or magic marker and twitches it back and forth.

Despite these behaviors, the child is described as outgoing, loving, trusting, and confident, with normal developmental fluctuations in these traits.

## How Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Works: The Anxiety-Compulsion Cycle

### Normal Anxiety Processing

Everyone experiences anxiety many times daily. Anything that provokes a **disgust reaction** - anything we consider "gross" - creates anxiety. The normal response follows this pattern:

1. Experience anxiety trigger
2. Learn to tolerate the anxiety
3. Do something to feel better (self-reassurance or appropriate action)
4. Anxiety decreases
5. Move on with life

**Example of healthy processing**: When seeing someone's messy drawer, a person might reassure themselves that nothing gross is actually in it, or remind themselves it's not their drawer. If something is genuinely gross (unflushed toilet), they take appropriate action (flush and wash hands), which decreases anxiety, and they continue with their day.

### The OCD Pattern

Some children find anxiety intolerable and develop a **physical reaction to manage their anxiety**. The most common compulsive behaviors are:
- **Compulsive hand-washing**
- **Compulsive spitting**

### Why Compulsions Don't Work and Create a Vicious Cycle

The compulsive behavior fails because:
1. It doesn't address the root problem, which is the anxiety itself
2. Anxiety feeds on itself and makes the person more anxious
3. The number of things that disgust or trigger anxiety tends to increase over time
4. This creates an escalating vicious cycle where more triggers lead to more compulsions

## When to Seek Professional Evaluation

The combination of these factors suggests evaluation by a **psychologist who specializes in OCD**:

1. Great anxiety expressed in response to disgust reactions
2. Spitting occurring both with disgust triggers AND with general nervousness (like performance anxiety)
3. The behavior happening multiple times daily

### The Marker-Holding Behavior

The secondary "tic" of holding and twitching a marker during imaginative storytelling is described as not concerning by itself. It simply indicates that the child finds it challenging at times to manage her anxiety. This is a supporting indicator rather than a primary concern.

## Treatment Approaches

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

**CBT is considered the most effective treatment for OCD behaviors** like compulsive spitting.

**How CBT for OCD works**:
1. The child is slowly exposed to objects that cause anxiety
2. They are helped to tolerate the anxiety without resorting to the compulsive behavior
3. Tolerating the anxiety slowly empties the "emotional backpack" of whatever is making the child so anxious

**Why exposure works - the mechanism**:
This is not simply a "conditioned" response. When we are able to sit with whatever is making us anxious and breathe through it, the anxiety actually diminishes. This is genuine processing and working through the anxiety, not just behavior modification.

**Outcome of learning anxiety management**:
- Gives the child an essential tool for daily life
- Reduces the frequency of anxious/disgusted feelings
- Reduces the need to spit

### Prognosis

**The good news**: Most kids who receive cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD in childhood outgrow their symptoms, or at least learn to manage them, by the teen years.

### Medication

Medications are sometimes prescribed for kids with severe OCD symptoms who don't respond to CBT alone. However, the mild symptoms described in this case would most likely not require medication.

### PANDAS Evaluation

A specialist should evaluate the possibility of **PANDAS** (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections). This is an infection-induced tendency to OCD symptoms.

**Key diagnostic distinction**: PANDAS is characterized by **acute onset** of OCD symptoms (sudden appearance), as opposed to gradual development of symptoms.

## Six Parent Support Strategies

### 1. Help Your Child Become Aware of Her Anxiety

**Goal**: Move from being in the grip of anxiety and reacting automatically to being able to manage it consciously.

**Method**: Develop a consistent phrase that prompts her to:
- Check in with her body
- Take a deep breath
- Simply notice what is going on inside her

**What to expect**: This will likely feel uncomfortable initially but will ease anxiety the more she does it. It becomes a helpful "go-to" that she can use when she starts to get hijacked by anxiety.

### 2. Teach Specific Skills and Habits That Decrease Anxiety

The goal is for the child to learn how it feels to shift out of anxiety and into calm and ease, so she can reproduce that state at will.

**Practical suggestions**:
- Get a relaxation audio designed for kids and do it together with her
- Explore guided meditations
- Try breathing exercises
- Consider yoga

**Key implementation point**: Help her use the chosen practice regularly so it becomes a habit, not just an occasional intervention.

### 3. Support Emotional Intelligence Development

**The mechanism of how suppressed emotions create anxiety**:
1. When humans have emotions they don't feel comfortable expressing, they push them down inside
2. Those suppressed emotions are always trying to surface to be felt
3. Being felt is what heals and releases emotions
4. We experience that inner turbulence (emotions trying to surface) as anxiety

**Therefore**: Helping your daughter put her emotions into words or express them through art will help reduce her anxiety by allowing those suppressed emotions to be processed and released.

### 4. Get Your Child Laughing Every Day

**Why laughter reduces anxiety - two explanations**:

**Psychological mechanism**: Laughter siphons off the top layer of fear (which is mild anxiety) from the "emotional backpack"

**Physiological mechanism**: Laughter transforms body chemistry by reducing stress hormones and increasing feel-good hormones

### 5. Work on Your Own Worries About Your Child

**Why this matters**: Parents can inadvertently make their child more anxious through their own visible concern.

**Methods**:
- Writing in a journal (may be sufficient for simpler cases)
- Scheduling sessions with a parenting coach or counselor (for more significant concerns)

### 6. Read Books on Supporting Kids with Anxiety

The purpose is to learn more strategies to support her. (Two book recommendations were mentioned but titles were not included in the original text.)

## Parent Behavior Assessment

### What the Parent Did Right

The parent's approach of showing her daughter the dresser drawer and asking why she was spitting was "totally appropriate." While this may have temporarily increased the daughter's anxiety, it was necessary for the parent to help her.

### The Concern About Creating Anxiety Around Spitting

The parent noticed that the daughter now seems nervous about spitting in front of her. The parent had not reprimanded - only insisted a few times on understanding what was bothering the child. Even though this wasn't done in an angry way, the parent couldn't disguise deepening concern.

**This is acknowledged** - the parent's visible concern may be adding to the child's anxiety about the behavior itself.

## Key Concepts and Frameworks

### The "Emotional Backpack" Metaphor

This appears throughout as a way to understand anxiety:
- Emotions get stored in an "emotional backpack"
- The backpack creates pressure/turbulence experienced as anxiety
- Processing emotions through tolerance, expression, or laughter "empties" or "siphons off" from the backpack
- The fuller the backpack, the more easily triggered the anxiety response

### Anxiety Feeding on Itself

A core principle: anxiety tends to feed on itself. This explains:
- Why the number of triggers increases over time
- Why early intervention matters
- Why compulsions create a vicious cycle rather than providing relief

### The Difference Between Compulsive Responses and Effective Responses

**Compulsive response**: Physical action (spitting, hand-washing) that temporarily reduces anxiety without addressing the root cause

**Effective response**: Self-reassurance, appropriate action when warranted, or learning to tolerate and breathe through the anxiety until it diminishes naturally

## Prognosis Factors

**Positive indicators in this case**:
- Early parental attention to the issue
- Symptoms described as mild
- Child is otherwise well-adjusted (outgoing, loving, trusting, confident)

**Expected outcome with proper intervention**: The child will learn skills to manage anxiety that will serve her throughout her life, not just resolve the current symptoms.
