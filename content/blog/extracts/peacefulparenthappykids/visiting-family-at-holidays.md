## Core Challenge: Why Holiday Visits Are Stressful for Children

We all want our parents to see how wonderful our kids are. Unfortunately, taking them to visit over the holidays often doesn't give children a chance to shine. **Kids get off their routines, become over-stimulated, and feel disconnected from their parents.** At that point, they're likely to crash and burn.

The good news: with proper preparation and realistic expectations, a smooth visit becomes much more likely.

## Managing Your Own Expectations

### Accept Imperfection

Your parenting cannot be judged by your child's behavior, but only by **how you respond** to your child. And none of us should be judged by our worst days.

**Key reframes:**
- If your toddler is teething, he won't suddenly become less whiny at Grandma's
- Your very active six year old isn't going to be less active in a new environment
- You can expect your difficult relative to be difficult again this year
- Life doesn't have to be perfect to be good

**Your children can act terribly and it doesn't mean you're a terrible parent - it means they're kids.** Your parents probably remember you acting terribly once or twice, and you came out okay.

## Preparation Strategies Before You Go

### Create a Photo Book of Relatives

Print out photos of the folks you'll be seeing and make a little book for your child. When faces are somewhat familiar even though the situation isn't, **children feel safer and become less reactive.** Don't forget to read books about airplanes if you're flying.

### Explain and Role-Play Expected Behaviors

Always explain to kids in advance what will be happening and what kind of behavior is appropriate. Role play with them or make a game of it before you go.

**Practice scenarios:**
- "At Grandma's, we use inside voices and we don't run."
- "What if you don't like a present you're given?"
- "When you want to leave the table, how do you ask?"
- "What do you do when Uncle Arnold wants to hug you hello?"
- "What will you do if the cousins start arguing?"

If your parents say grace before the meal and you don't, demonstrate and explain why children will need to be quiet for a few minutes.

## Maintaining Routines and Schedules

### Sleep as Foundation

**Early to bed and early to rise** gives little ones time to explore the house early in the morning while other folks are still in bed. This exploration time helps them feel more comfortable even when the place starts hopping.

Invite Grandma to see how wonderful your child is when she's rested and not overwhelmed - this is strategic timing for showing off your child at their best.

### Keep Familiar Routines

Kids need the security of familiar routines. They're stressed by unfamiliar events and what feels to them like chaotic unpredictability. **Do what you can to keep them on schedule and be patient when they get hyped-up or irritable.** Be sure everyone (including you!) gets enough sleep.

### Have Age-Appropriate Expectations

An 18 month old and a 3 year old cannot be expected to sit quietly while you enjoy a long dinner. Talk with the other parents of young children and see if the kids can be excused to watch an acceptable video. Your parents can probably understand that if they're required to stay at the table, either the conversation or the children's behavior (or both) will degenerate.

## Managing Overstimulation

### Recognize Children's Need for Downtime

Kids need downtime, just to chill out, snuggle, and do whatever relaxes them. **If they don't get it, they can't really be blamed for melting down when the over-stimulation gets to them.**

**Practical strategies:**
- Identify what your child does at home to relax (take a bath, play with imaginary friend, play with figurines)
- Make sure every day includes a little downtime with your child's favorite activity to help them regroup
- Don't plan too many activities
- When they get fussy, take them outside to decompress

### The Power of Laughter

Laughter reduces the amount of stress hormones circulating in the body. **Your child needs some real belly laughing every day to keep the stress of all that newness from getting to them.**

### When Tears Come

If your child dissolves into tears, hold and soothe them. Take them into a private place where you won't feel pressured to shush the crying. **After they get a chance to express all that tension, they'll feel (and act!) much better.** The tears are releasing the stress, not making things worse.

## Nutrition and Physical Needs

### Watch Food Intake

Many tantrums originate from hunger. And all parents recognize the sugar high that sends kids bouncing off walls and then crashing into tears.

**Practical steps:**
- Speak with grandparents in advance about limiting treats if necessary
- Carry small protein-rich snacks with you so your child doesn't have a melt-down waiting for dinner to be served

## Staying Connected With Your Child

### Why Connection Matters

Your children may love running in a pack with the cousins, which is one of the delights of family. But be sure to re-connect with them frequently. **Feeling disconnected in a strange place can cause even the most resilient child to melt down over something small.**

### Connection Rituals

- **Morning snuggle:** Snuggle with your child every morning before getting out of bed
- **Preview the day:** It's very grounding for kids to hear from you how the day is expected to unfold, even if it will be a lot like yesterday
- **Bedtime books:** Bring some favorite books from home to help them reconnect and relax at night

## Responding to Difficult Behavior

### Why Force Backfires

Kids resist force and control. When we feel like our child is giving us a hard time while others are watching, our impulse is usually to use force or to threaten it. **But when we do that, we escalate the upset and ensure that our child will argue with us and keep pushing to get her way.**

### The Joining Approach

If instead we remember that **our child is giving us a hard time because she's having a hard time**, we can usually "join" with her and avert the crisis. When we take the time to acknowledge our child's feelings, she's much more able to face her disappointment and move on.

**Example script:** "You were really hoping to finish the movie, but Grandma says it's time to eat... I know you're disappointed... It was at the exciting part, huh?... Do you want to ask Grandma if we can borrow it so you can watch it later?"

At worst, she may need to cry a bit and then she'll be ready to come to dinner. For this reason, **always give your child plenty of advance warning before transitions.**

## Empathy as Your Primary Tool

### The Magic Wand Effect

Empathy won't always make challenging feelings disappear, but if you really see things from the other person's perspective - not necessarily agreeing or changing your own view, but understanding - **you'll find that the other person becomes more willing to understand your view.**

### Empathy Works on Everyone

This is true for children, but it is also true for your critical aunt or worried father. When your relatives criticize your child, listen and acknowledge their concern. When your child balks, always start with empathy and reconnection.

**You may find that your critical relatives are astonished at how your empathy helps your child calm down and re-group.** This becomes a demonstration of your parenting approach's effectiveness.

## Managing Grandparent Relationships

### Reassure the Grandparents

You're allowed to brag; these are grandparents! Reassure them that their grandchildren are coming out fine.

### Explain Your Approach (If Appropriate)

In quiet moments with your parents, you can explain anything about your parenting that you know they're having a hard time with, if you have that kind of relationship. **Emphasize that you've given it a lot of thought, and you're parenting this way because you're convinced it leads to kids growing up better adjusted.**

Thank your parents for supporting you, as they always have. If they give you a hard time, you can remind them lightly that they had their chance, and now it's time for you to make your own mistakes.

## Taking Care of Yourself

### Recognize Your Own Stress

Don't forget that family visits can be stressful for you too. **Parents have a way of pushing our buttons, even when we're grown.** Don't feel like you have to prove yourself to your parents. You're a grown-up now, you're your child's mother or father, and you're the one who has to take final responsibility about what's best for your child.

### Why Your Emotional State Matters

Your kids depend on you not only to regulate their environment but also to help them regulate their moods. **If you're anxious in advance, do some journaling or blow off steam to a friend about your anxieties, so you don't start the visit tense.**

### Self-Compassion Strategies

- Forgive yourself in advance for not being perfect
- Use EFT tapping if you find yourself upset during your visit
- Use mantras like "I'm a good enough mother!" to keep emotional balance
- **Keep your own cup full of self love, so you can handle whatever comes up**
