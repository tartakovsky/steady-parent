## Core Position: Spanking Risks Psychological and Relational Harm

The central thesis is that **spanking carries the risk of damaging a child's psyche and the parent-child relationship**. This position is grounded in research showing that:

1. Other discipline methods are more effective than spanking
2. Spanking is associated with increased bad behavior following the spanking (not decreased behavior as parents often hope)

The research contradicts popular beliefs and circulating claims that not spanking is harmful. The evidence points in the opposite direction: spanking itself correlates with worse outcomes.

## The Fundamental Contradiction in Using Spanking for Respect

A key logical argument against spanking centers on a contradiction: **You cannot teach respect through disrespect.** Hitting someone is fundamentally a disrespectful act. Attempting to teach a child to treat you respectfully by treating them disrespectfully (hitting them) creates a logical and moral inconsistency.

This contradiction becomes practically evident over time: What happens when the child is fourteen and bigger than the parent? The technique cannot scale because it relies on physical dominance. Parents who use spanking will eventually face a choice between escalating (using more force) or abandoning the approach entirely when the power dynamic shifts.

## Why Spanking Undermines Its Own Goal

**Teaching discipline includes teaching children to control their angry impulses.** Spanking directly sabotages this goal because it models violence. The parent demonstrates that when frustrated or when rules are broken, physical force is an acceptable response. The child then learns this same pattern.

This creates a cycle where:
- Parent uses physical force to address behavior
- Child learns that physical force is how you handle situations when someone does something you don't like
- Child applies this learning in other contexts (hitting siblings, hitting peers)

## The Mechanism: Fear and Pain Create Unintended Consequences

Spanking works through **fear and pain**, and this mechanism carries significant costs:

**What the child learns from spanking:**
- Hitting is acceptable in certain circumstances
- People who love you will cause you pain
- Parents cannot always be counted on to understand and help you

**The emotional aftermath:**
Spanking leaves children with a residue of guilt, pain, and fear layered on top of whatever emotions were causing them to act inappropriately in the first place. The child is then abandoned to sort out all these complicated emotions and to feel like a bad person.

**The behavioral consequence:**
Kids who feel bad about themselves are more likely to "act bad." This is the opposite of what parents intend. The emotion that was causing the inappropriate behavior gets repressed rather than addressed, and it will resurface later in other forms.

**A specific example:** A toddler who is spanked for hitting the baby doesn't learn not to hit. Instead, the anger at the baby gets repressed. That anger pops out later when Mom leaves the room and the toddler hits the baby anyway. This illustrates a universal pattern: a person who gets kicked looks for someone smaller to kick.

## The Alternative: Empathic Parenting and Emotional Intelligence

**The effective alternative involves empathizing with feelings while limiting actions.** This approach gives children tools they can actually use to manage their emotions, which leads to better behavior.

**How it works in practice:**
- The toddler who is angry at the baby learns that his anger is understandable (validation)
- He also learns that he can voice that feeling to mom rather than hitting the baby (giving an alternative action)
- The underlying emotion gets addressed rather than repressed

**The outcome:** Kids who feel good about themselves are more likely to "act good." This is the inverse of the spanking dynamic.

## The Parents' Frustration and Resentment

Many parents feel frustrated about discipline because if they cannot hit or threaten, they must elicit cooperation some other way. All methods of force ultimately rely on the threat of violence. For example, what do you do if your kid won't accept a timeout? Without force as a backup, parents feel their tools have been taken away. They don't know how to manage and control their kids, so they resent this and would rather spank.

This frustration is understandable but misguided. The solution is not to return to force-based methods but to learn cooperation-based approaches that don't require escalation.

## Discipline Is Still Necessary

**The argument against spanking is not an argument against discipline.** Kids definitely need limits. The claim is that spanking makes it harder for children to behave well, not that limits should be removed.

Properly administered discipline is mandatory to raising a happy, well-adjusted person. Parents who won't discipline their children are not doing them or society any favors. However, there are many ways to address discipline situations without ever hitting the child.

**Example of effective discipline without hitting:** When a child misbehaves in a store, the parent can chase him down, physically pick him up, explain the rules, and remove him from the situation if he won't behave. This must happen each and every time, even though the parent still has shopping and errands to do. This is harder than ignoring the behavior or using a quick swat, but it produces better outcomes.

Parents who sit there while their kids run amok appear lazy, unconcerned, and oblivious. Their failure is not that they refuse to hit their children - it's that they refuse to put in the effort to discipline without hitting.

## The Personal Growth Challenge

**It is easier to raise kids as we were raised than to become more loving and compassionate ourselves.** This framing redefines parenting as an opportunity for personal growth. The question becomes: Isn't becoming more loving and compassionate the work we are here to do?

This shifts the conversation from "what is the most effective technique" to "what kind of person do I want to become through parenting?"

## Biblical Interpretation: "Rod" and Discipline

For parents who reference biblical teachings, particularly Proverbs 13:24, there is an important interpretive point:

The New Living Translation reads: "If you refuse to discipline your children, it proves you don't love them; if you love your children, you will be prompt to discipline them."

The word "rod" in older translations could be interpreted to imply physical striking, but:
- The Hebrew word had multiple meanings
- There may not be a good translation
- We do not know which meaning was originally intended

**The historical context matters:** Child psychology was about 4500 years away when these texts were written. Striking was the state-of-the-art for discipline in that society. To them, striking probably was discipline. These were also people who stoned adulterous women in public, and the punishment for breaking the sabbath was death.

**The interpretive principle:** Humans evolve and society evolves and religious understanding has evolved also. Something can contain truth without being literal. The underlying truth of the proverb - that discipline is an act of love and neglecting it harms children - remains valid even if the specific manifestation (physical striking) has been superseded by better methods.

## Correcting Misinformation

The claim that Dr. Benjamin Spock's son committed suicide is factually incorrect:
- Dr. Spock had two children: Michael and John
- Both are still alive
- One of his grandchildren, who was not raised by Dr. Spock, had schizophrenia and did commit suicide

This matters because the false claim is used to argue that not spanking produces bad outcomes. The correction removes that evidence.

## Personal Testimony: Non-Spanking Outcomes

Dr. Laura's own children, who have never been spanked or even punished, are described as delightful, respectful, and responsible teenagers who would do anything to please their parents.

While this is acknowledged as not necessarily cause and effect, it serves as a counter-example to claims that not spanking produces disrespectful children. The stronger claim: she shudders to think how much less like this they would have turned out if she had "abused their trust by spanking them."

---

## The Trust Framework

Spanking is framed as an abuse of trust. Children trust their parents to understand and help them. When parents hit children, they violate that trust. This violation has lasting effects on the relationship.

## Key Questions for Parents Who Spank

1. Do you really think it is necessary to treat someone disrespectfully (hitting them) to teach them to treat you respectfully?

2. Do you think your technique will still work when he's fourteen and bigger than you are, or will you need to escalate at that point?

These questions are designed to surface the logical contradictions and practical limitations of spanking as a discipline strategy.
