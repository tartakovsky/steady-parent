# Do First Born Kids Have Higher IQs?

## Core Finding: The Birth Order and IQ Connection

**Research confirms a small IQ advantage for firstborns.** Multiple studies over the years have found a small but significant IQ gap between first-born children of either gender and their younger siblings.

**The Norwegian study quantifies the gap.** A large and well-designed Norwegian study found that oldest children as a group are three IQ points smarter than their next-eldest brothers, who are in turn slightly smarter than those younger.

**Important distinction about the data.** The study found that firstborns as a group have a 3-point IQ lead, not that individual firstborns are necessarily smarter than their specific siblings.

## Theories Explaining the IQ Gap

**Traditional explanation: Parental attention.** Parents are free to lavish more attention on their firstborn until more children arrive. Parents typically worry more over the first baby and impose higher standards.

**Novel theory: The tutoring hypothesis.** The Norwegian researchers propose that oldest children benefit from being in the position of teaching their siblings and showing them how to do things. The tutor may get more cognitive benefit from the teaching than the recipient does from learning.

## Why This Difference Is Not as Significant as It Seems

**IQ above a threshold matters less than personality.** A scientist with an IQ of 130 is just as likely to win a Nobel Prize as a scientist with an IQ of 180. Personality traits and EQ are what make the difference in achievement.

**EQ may matter more than IQ for life success.** Emotional Quotient (EQ) is arguably more important in life achievement than a few points of IQ, and definitely more important in happiness ratings.

**What high EQ means.** Being better able to manage one's emotions and anxiety, being more aware of one's own and others' feelings, and having better interpersonal skills.

## The Trade-Offs of Birth Order

**Younger siblings may have EQ advantages.** Because parents are less anxious with subsequent children, younger siblings are generally better able to manage anxiety. They are also generally recognized as having better interpersonal skills, suggesting higher EQs.

**Firstborn stress factors.** Oldest kids run a higher risk of becoming alcoholics and substance abusers according to the research. First-borns need parental encouragement to relax and be themselves, so they don't bear the full weight of the parents' neuroses.

## Practical Strategies for Parents

### 1. Maintain Perspective

**Relax about the IQ difference.** This is not that big a deal. How you listen to your child daily, how you set limits (with empathy), and how much you read to your child will have much more impact on success than three IQ points.

### 2. Encourage Peer Tutoring

**Create tutoring opportunities for all children.** Both older and younger kids can provide leadership in things they're better at. Every child is knowledgeable about something.

**Practical implementation ideas:**
- Encourage kids to "teach" at the dinner table
- Arrange for younger siblings to tutor kids at school
- Let each child lead in their area of strength

### 3. Focus on Proven IQ Boosters

**Breastfeeding provides a 5-point IQ boost.** According to comprehensive research, breastfeeding a baby will increase their IQ by 5 points.

**Reading and limiting TV are the best parental interventions.** Other than breastfeeding, the most effective ways for parents to raise a child's IQ are reading to them and limiting television. This will more than make up for any birth order impact.

### 4. Consider Family Structure Factors

**Family size matters more than birth order.** The more kids in a family, the lower the kids' IQs are likely to be.

**Child spacing is significant.** Spacing children closer than two years apart is a risk factor for not having a solid bond with either child, which lowers both EQ and IQ.

## Key Concepts Summary

**Birth Order IQ Gap:** A small but measurable difference (approximately 3 points) favoring firstborn children, found across multiple studies.

**Tutoring Hypothesis:** The theory that firstborns benefit cognitively from being in the position of teaching and explaining things to younger siblings.

**EQ (Emotional Quotient):** A measure of emotional intelligence including self-regulation, emotional awareness, and interpersonal skills that may be more predictive of life success than IQ.

**The EQ Compensation:** Younger siblings may develop higher emotional intelligence due to experiencing less anxious parenting and having more peer interaction, potentially offsetting any IQ disadvantage.

## Factors That Matter More Than Birth Order

**Daily parenting practices:**
- Listening to your child
- Setting limits with empathy
- Reading to your child regularly

**Family structure decisions:**
- Family size
- Spacing between children
- Quality of parent-child bond

**What determines achievement:** Personality traits and emotional intelligence differentiate high achievers above IQ thresholds, not additional IQ points.
