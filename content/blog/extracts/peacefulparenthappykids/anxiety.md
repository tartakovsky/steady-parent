# Helping Children Manage Anxiety

## The Core Goal of Anxiety Support

The goal is NOT to raise a child who doesn't get anxious, which would be impossible. The goal is to raise a child who:
- Has experienced the discomfort of feeling uncertain and somewhat worried
- Knows that those feelings are completely normal
- Believes that whatever happens, they can handle it

This means helping children develop both internal resources (self-regulation, confidence, coping strategies) and the ability to find external resources (support from others, problem-solving approaches) that will enable them to face and manage whatever life throws at them.

**The benchmark for healthy anxiety management**: If a child can notice fear, acknowledge it, and act without letting the fear stop them, they're handling it in a healthy way. If the fear disables them, they need support to manage it more effectively.

## Understanding What Anxiety Is

**Anxiety is a normal fear response** to something perceived as a threat. For children, threats can range widely:
- A sibling taking their toy
- Swimming lessons
- Starting a new school year with a new teacher
- Developmental milestones like potty training or sleeping in their own bed

These everyday developmental tasks are often perceived by children as threats, triggering anxiety responses.

### How Anxiety Manifests in Children

Anxiety shows up in different forms:
- Fear of particular things (separations from a parent, social interactions)
- Specific phobias (bees, dogs)
- General tendency toward worries of all kinds
- Fear reactions to anything new, indicating a chronic state of mild alarm

### The Fight-Flight-Freeze Response

When children feel fearful, their internal alarm system activates, leading to:
- **Flight**: Hiding behind a parent's leg, escaping to the bathroom at school
- **Fight**: Screaming "I hate you!", pushing a sibling down
- **Freeze**: Not responding to questions from unfamiliar adults, refusing to jump into the pool at swimming lessons

### Why Some Anxiety Is Beneficial

Children constantly face new things that naturally inspire some anxiety. A little worry when approaching something new is normal and even beneficial because it helps them "look before they leap" to ensure a situation is safe. The goal is not fearlessness, which would actually be evidence of poor judgment. The goal is to feel that fear AND face the situation anyway.

## Seven Strategies for Supporting Anxious Children

### 1. Listen and Empathize

Use phrases like:
- "I see how much that worries you. Tell me more."
- "Hmm... That does sound a little scary. What would be the worst thing about that?"

**Why this matters**: Some parents avoid giving credibility to "unreasonable" fears and try to talk children out of their fears or shut down their expression. This backfires because it leaves the child feeling alone and unsupported with their anxious feelings.

**Critical distinction**: Listening and acknowledging does NOT mean communicating that you think the situation is unsafe. You can empathize with how something felt hard to your child without agreeing that the fears are realistic or that the scary situation is catastrophic.

**How children learn to tolerate anxiety-inducing events**: They have backup, so they feel safer. Your child feels your support, which enables them to do the hard thing.

**The coaching effect**: Children learn to coach themselves through anxiety-producing situations by the way you coach them. Remain calm and reassuring while acknowledging their feelings. They gain confidence to handle new situations by having experiences of facing anxiety-inducing situations and coming through them successfully. Encourage them to face scary things over time and with support.

### 2. Teach How Anxiety Works (The Neurological Feedback Loop)

Children benefit from understanding the mechanism that can make anxiety escalate:

1. A thought makes us feel a bit anxious ("Everyone is looking at me")
2. That thought shifts us into emergency mode; we rev up for flight or freeze
3. Physical changes occur: sweating, nausea, strong urge to run and hide
4. As we notice these physical signs of anxiety, our brain recognizes them as signs of danger
5. This scares us even more
6. Brain and body keep sending escalating messages to each other
7. The feeling of danger begins to spiral ("What if people notice I'm sweating? What if I throw up?")
8. We begin to panic

Understanding this loop helps children recognize what's happening and interrupt it.

### 3. The NED Approach: Teaching Children That Worry Is Just Trying to Keep Them Safe

**Key insight**: Worry wants to keep your child safe at all costs, and happiness is not part of its job description. Worry would like to keep your child in a box so no danger could get in. But that would mean no fun, no growth, no real life.

**Worry's tactics**: It exaggerates and threatens with worst-case scenarios that are unlikely to happen.

The **NED** approach teaches children to stand up to worries:

**N - Notice and Normalize**
Notice the worry that is scaring you and normalize it. It's okay to feel worry. It's normal. Everyone feels worry sometimes. It is nothing to worry about.

**E - Externalize**
The worry is not part of you. You can choose whether to have it. If this is a problem you can solve right now, do it. If it cannot be solved, then it is just noise, like a watchdog barking. There is no immediate problem. If one arises, you will handle it.

**D - Dispute**
Since worry is about the future, it is never absolutely true. You can feel the fear and do it anyway. It's okay to feel uncomfortable; that's often how we learn. You can handle whatever happens.

**Personifying worry**: Children may find it easier to externalize the worry if they call it by a name (NED, Nervous Nellie). Some parents use "Worry Monster" from the popular book, but if that sounds scary to your child, find another name. Emphasize that your child is much bigger than their worry.

### 4. Strategies to Manage Physical Feelings of Anxiety

**The breathing mechanism**: Research shows that slow deep breathing that lengthens the out-breath sends a calming message to the nervous system and can stop the flood of stress hormones. The logic: if a tiger was chasing you, you wouldn't stop to calmly breathe. So calm breathing signals safety to the body.

**Physical comfort**: A big hug from a safe person has a similar calming effect.

**Building a personal toolkit**: Brainstorm with your child to create a list of calming strategies to try, so they can develop a short list of their favorites.

**The retraining effect**: Any calming strategy that your child uses consistently will become increasingly effective and will actually retrain the nervous system so that it recovers more quickly from stress.

### 5. Titrate: Break Challenges Into Manageable Steps

**The principle**: Start with smaller challenges so your child can be successful. Break bigger challenges down into smaller steps, take them one step at a time, and celebrate every victory.

**Why this works**: For a child to learn that they can handle something scary, they need to actually have handled scary things in the past. Learning that they can tolerate the discomfort of feeling a bit anxious, and that things do work out, helps children become less anxious. They begin to gain the confidence that they can handle whatever happens.

**The bike-riding example**: If your child is afraid of riding a bike:
- Don't get impatient or angry
- Don't belittle them
- Run alongside, holding up the bike
- Go very slowly at first
- Gradually make it possible for them to be brave enough to put their feet on the pedals
- Eventually they ask you to let go
- They learn one step at a time, little bit by little bit: "I did something scary and I feel brave now"

**What NOT to do**: Don't rescue your child when they're uncomfortable. Instead, support them through it. Be their backup. Reassure them. Help them brainstorm ways to handle discomfort and nervousness.

**The identity-building effect**: Every time you support them gradually to do something anxiety-producing, your child learns that they're a person who can be courageous in the face of fear, who can handle what life throws at them and manage somehow to get through it. Maybe even grow from it.

**The physical retraining**: This approach builds your child's tolerance for the uncomfortable physical sensations that come with fear. They learn to tolerate those sensations without getting more anxious. That retrains the nervous system.

**The balance**: Give your child all the support in the world, but also believe in their ability to handle it.

### 6. Decrease Anxiety with Emotional Preventive Maintenance

**The underlying mechanism**: When humans repress emotions, those emotions don't go away. They get locked in the body, increasing tension. They are always looking to bubble up to the surface to be felt and expressed and healed.

**Why this matters for anxiety**: Children need daily "emotional preventive maintenance" to give them a chance to feel safe enough to feel and express their emotions. This is especially important if a child has some emotions that they did not feel safe to express at some point in the past, that have been locked away in their "emotional backpack."

**Five components of emotional preventive maintenance**:

1. **Empathy 24/7**: Creates the safety that is essential for emotional expression

2. **Laughter and Roughhousing**: Changes the body chemistry to decrease the stress hormones that contribute to anxiety. Children who tend to be more anxious need lots of laughter daily.

3. **One-on-one time with you**: Strengthens safety and offers opportunity for emotional expression and working through whatever worries the child

4. **Welcoming emotions**: When you allow all emotions to be expressed, even while prohibiting certain behaviors like hitting or destroying property, your child empties their emotional backpack and becomes less anxious

5. **Routines that include regular opportunities for connection**: Strengthen your relationship and allow your child to count on a time to tell you upsetting things and be heard

### 7. Teach Strategies to Manage the Mind's Tendency Toward Worry and Negativity

**The chronic activation problem**: Children who are often anxious have a chronically activated alarm system. They need support to notice the thoughts that are triggering those feelings of alarm so they can learn to manage those thoughts.

**How the mind creates patterns**: The human mind is constantly drawing conclusions, and often it gets into negative patterns. We can break those patterns by:
- Becoming more aware of our thoughts
- Challenging the negative or fearful ones

**Key insight**: Just because your mind thinks something does not mean it is true. Any thought about the future is not true because it may or may not happen.

**Reframing safety**: We can perceive ourselves as being safe in the world even when life is unpredictable. We do that by realizing that we can handle whatever happens.

**The sequence for handling anxiety**:
1. Normalize it - it is predictable that we will feel some fear when we do hard things
2. Decide not to let the fear stop us

## The Reframe: Anxiety Is Not Dangerous

**Anxiety itself is not actually dangerous.** It's our responses to the anxiety that cripple us.

**The alternative approach**: Teach children simply to notice when they feel anxious. Tell them: "Being a bit anxious is normal. It's okay to feel uncomfortable. You are big enough inside to handle this. What strategies can you use to handle this?"

**The ultimate lesson**: Teach children that they can feel the fear and do it anyway.
