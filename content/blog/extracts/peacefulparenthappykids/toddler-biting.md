# Understanding and Responding to Toddler Biting

## Why Toddlers Bite: Three Core Reasons

Toddler biting is not random or malicious. It falls into distinct categories, each requiring a different response.

### 1. Exploratory Biting

Most babies experiment with biting in an **exploratory fashion** to see what happens. This commonly occurs during nursing or snuggling. When they learn that the parent's response is "OUCH!" they generally have no further need to explore that path. The natural consequence of seeing pain registers, and curiosity is satisfied.

### 2. Connection-Seeking Biting

Sometimes little ones bite in an attempt to **provoke a reaction**, which should be understood as a **plea for connection**. The example given: if you are on your phone and your child bites you, she's communicating a message: "Please connect with me!"

The response should acknowledge both the unacceptable behavior and the legitimate underlying need. Even if the child can't talk yet, say: "Ouch! No biting. Biting hurts. Do you want me to put away the phone? Call my name. Say 'Mommy!' and I will hear you."

This teaches an alternative way to get attention while validating that the need for connection is legitimate.

### 3. Frustration or Anger Expression

The most common reason toddlers bite is that they are **angry or frustrated and don't yet have the words to express it**. This is especially relevant for toddlers who are learning to manage frustration and anger. The solution is giving them alternative ways to express themselves, so they won't need to bite.

**Key insight about tension and biting**: When we feel tension, we feel it first in the mouth. This explains why little ones often bite as a first response to any feelings of upset. The mouth is where emotional tension physically manifests.

## Prevention: The Best Strategy

Prevention is always preferable to reaction. If you sense your little one might be about to bite, hold her away from you and say: "You are MAD but no biting! Biting hurts."

**Research finding**: Simply acknowledging the feelings of pre-verbal little ones can not only prevent biting, it can actually end tantrums. This works because **receptive language is many months ahead of expressive language**. Children understand far more than they can say, so verbal acknowledgment of their feelings registers even before they can speak.

## Responding When Biting Occurs

### The Honest Reaction Approach

When your child bites, let her know that it HURT. You will likely be startled, and she'll see your automatic startled, pained response and hear you say a loud "OUCH, that HURT!"

Focus on the place where you were bitten and give yourself a moment to recover. This pause serves a crucial purpose: it allows you to actually empathize rather than attacking. After recovering, acknowledge what she's trying to tell you: "You are mad! You can tell me MAD! But no biting. Biting hurts. OUCH!"

**Why honest reactions matter**: The common advice is to avoid strong reactions so you don't "reward misbehavior by attending to it." However, experience shows that ignoring biting doesn't stop the behavior for a long time, if at all.

More importantly, it is a bad idea to ignore your child's communication. You want to give her the message that she is hurting you and hurting your relationship. Children look to parents to show them how relationships work. Reacting honestly teaches authentic emotional communication. Usually, an honest reaction stops the behavior immediately.

### When Initial Response Doesn't Work

Most kids will stop biting after the honest reaction approach. If she doesn't stop, it indicates one of two deeper issues:

#### Pattern A: Biting for Reaction (Connection Need)

If the child is biting to provoke your reaction, this is a plea for connection. The response is to shower her with attention BEFORE she bites, or during the times when she usually bites.

**Specific example**: If she bites while nursing so that you will look at her, the biting is a communication strategy. Address the underlying need proactively.

#### Pattern B: Accumulated Tension Needing Release

The child may have a great deal of tension that she is trying to express. This requires a two-pronged approach:

**Proactive tension reduction through laughter**: Every toddler needs daily laughter to reduce stress hormones in their body. Find ways to get your child laughing, such as:
- Chasing her around to shower her with kisses
- Letting her push you over

**Facilitating emotional release through crying**: Sometimes kids bite because they are upset and can't express it. They really just need to cry, but don't want to feel those feelings so they bite instead.

**Testing if this is the underlying cause**: Set your limit with understanding, in a kind voice that helps her feel safe enough to get in touch with whatever feelings are beneath her biting. Say: "No biting... What's the matter, Sweetie?"

If you set a clear, kind limit while looking into her eyes, she will likely burst into tears. This confirms she needed emotional release. Tell her: "That's ok, Sweetie, cry as much as you want, I am right here" and hold her.

If despite your best efforts she does bite you, look her in the eye and say: "OUCH, you hurt me! You are mad! You can show me you're mad, but no biting." Usually at that point the child will begin crying. A good cry helps her let those feelings out, and she won't need to bite anymore.

### The Giggling Response

It is possible that instead of crying, the child will start giggling after biting. Most parents get angry when their child starts laughing after biting, but **this is just a way of letting off the tension and upset that caused the bite**. Let her laugh as much as she can. Crying may follow.

After all these feelings are out, cuddle your little one and say: "You needed to show me how you were feeling. You can show me by making faces." (Make an angry face here, then smile so she doesn't think you're serious.) "But biting hurts. No biting."

This teaches an alternative acceptable way to express anger (facial expressions) while reinforcing the boundary against biting.

## Additional Strategy: Redirection to Appropriate Objects

It often works to give little biters a teether and tell them: "Teethers are for biting, we never bite people."

This provides a legitimate outlet for the physical urge to bite while establishing a clear category distinction: objects can be bitten, people cannot.

## Why Ignoring Biting Is Counterproductive

The conventional advice is to not react strongly, under the theory that strong reactions "reward" misbehavior by giving attention. However, this approach has problems:

1. **It doesn't work well**: Parents report that ignoring biting doesn't stop the behavior for a long time, if at all.

2. **It ignores legitimate communication**: If the toddler is biting to express frustration or anger, that expression is legitimate. We don't want to ignore it. We need to redirect that expression and let them know we are there to listen to all their feelings.

3. **It misses the crying signal**: If the toddler is biting because she is signaling that she needs to cry, we can facilitate that best by noticing, not by ignoring.

4. **It fails to model authentic relationships**: Children look to parents to understand how relationships work. Honest reactions to being hurt teach important lessons about empathy and the impact of actions on others.
