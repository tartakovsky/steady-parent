# Understanding and Responding to Tantrums in 13-Month-Olds

## Core Principle: Why Ignoring Tantrums Is Outdated

**The traditional advice to ignore tantrums is now considered outdated** based on what we understand about child brain development and emotional regulation.

The fundamental insight is that tantrums indicate a child cannot regulate himself in that moment. Children develop self-regulation capacity through **co-regulation** with their parents, meaning the child's nervous system picks up cues from the parent's limbic system about whether a situation is truly an emergency. When parents stay calm and reassuring, they restore the child's sense of safety, which allows the child to calm down.

**Ignoring an upset child decreases the child's sense of safety, making it harder for them to calm down** rather than easier. This is the opposite of what the "ignoring trick" is meant to accomplish. Many parents report that when they respond to their child's unhappiness with comfort and understanding, tantrums decrease in frequency over time. This aligns with brain research on how children learn self-regulation.

The deeper consequence: researchers now believe that when parents don't respond to a distressed child, they are handicapping the child's developing nervous system, making self-regulation harder for them throughout their lives. The stakes are not just about managing the current tantrum but about long-term emotional development.

## The Critical Distinction: Comfort vs. Giving In

There is an important difference between "giving in" to a tantrum and helping a child restore equilibrium:

- **Giving in** means promptly handing a child what they are tantrumming for every time they tantrum. This teaches the child that tantrums are an effective strategy for getting what they want.
- **Offering comfort** means helping the child feel safe and understood while maintaining the limit. This helps the child regulate without reinforcing tantrumming as a manipulation tactic.

You can set a limit (no candy before dinner) while still acknowledging and empathizing with the child's feelings about not getting what they wanted. These are separate actions that can happen simultaneously.

## What Tantrums Actually Are at 13 Months

A 13-month-old is not "throwing fits to get attention." The child is expressing unhappiness because:
- They feel passionately about everything at this age
- They don't have the capacity to control themselves yet
- They cannot express themselves like an adult

**The "resistance" that begins around 13-15 months is actually a very positive developmental milestone** - it represents the beginning of the child asserting himself as a separate person. This self-assertion is healthy and developmentally appropriate, even though it is challenging for parents.

As babies become less distractible and more assertive, they try to exert some control over their environment, just as all humans do. The child cannot talk yet but can certainly communicate by physically resisting situations they don't like.

## Why the Second Year Is Particularly Challenging

The second year is the most difficult period of this self-assertion for parents because toddlers don't yet have the neurological development to:
- Reason through situations
- Control their emotions

These capacities begin developing around age three or four. For the rest of childhood, the child will continue developing their sense of **agency** - becoming a person in their own right. Parents need to guide and set appropriate limits while accepting that the child will have their own ideas and, if they have "big feelings," will express disagreement in no uncertain terms.

## The Importance of Agency and Feeling Heard

The child's tantrumming is their first expression of agency in the world - the ability to express what they want and try to get it. Parents want children to feel they can have an impact on the world because this is how optimism, competence, and confidence develop.

When children see that parents care about satisfying their wishes, that is how they know they are loved. The analogy offered: if your spouse told you they loved you but always said no to what you wanted, would you feel loved?

The framework for responding:
- When babies express wishes and you can meet them: great, do so
- When you cannot meet their wishes for safety or other important reasons: they at least need to feel you have heard them and have a good reason for not helping them get what they think they need

## The Myth of Ignoring Unhappiness About Limits

**There is a common myth that if parents set a limit and children are upset about not getting what they wanted, parents should ignore their unhappiness. In fact, children always do better when parents acknowledge their feelings.**

Acknowledging feelings does not mean:
- Not setting limits
- Agreeing with the child's feelings or position

What it does mean: providing empathy alongside the limit.

**Limits without empathy is authoritarian child-raising, and just makes for angry, rebellious children.** When parents can set limits and empathize with the child's unhappiness about those limits, children internalize the limits in a healthy way and become much more cooperative.

How parents navigate moments of disagreement determines:
- How close the parent-child relationship will ultimately be
- Whether the child becomes "contrary" - feeling a need to resist parental authority in a knee-jerk fashion because the relationship has become an ongoing power struggle, and defiance is the only way the child can assert their personhood

## Practical Strategy: Giving Control to Reduce Defiance

**The more control toddlers have over their own lives, the less they need to be defiant.** Tantrums may decrease when parents let children make as many choices and have as much say as possible in their life, including decisions about food, clothes, toys, and other daily matters.

This does not mean giving in to everything. Parents will still set many limits. But setting limits with empathy means the child feels understood and is therefore less likely to resist the limits.

## Technique: Parenting Aikido

The approach is described as **Parenting Aikido** - granting the child's need for independence while still meeting the parent's need to keep things safe.

Concrete example: Give the child power to choose between two options that are both acceptable to the parent.
- "We have to get in the car now. Do you want to climb in yourself? Or do you want me to put you in?"

This provides genuine choice and a sense of control while still accomplishing the necessary task (getting in the car).

## How to Respond During a Tantrum

When a tantrum happens despite preventive efforts:

1. **Do not sever the connection.** Stay nearby even if the child won't let you touch them. They need to know you're there and still love them.

2. **Be calm and reassuring.** This models regulation and helps restore the child's sense of safety.

3. **Don't try to reason with them.** The child is not in a state where reasoning is possible.

4. **Acknowledge feelings simply, using few words.** Research shows that simply acknowledging feelings can shorten tantrums dramatically.
   - Example: "You are so mad. You are showing me how much you wanted that candy."

5. **Don't explain the reason for the limit during the tantrum.** Save explanations for after they calm down.

6. **Don't give them what they're tantrumming for.** Acknowledge and empathize without giving in.

7. **Afterward, reconnect.** Take some "cozy time" together so the child is reassured that you still love them.

## The Difference Between Tantrums and Meltdowns

Sometimes kids just need to cry to show you all their upset feelings. This is called a **meltdown** - an expression of accumulated emotion.

But sometimes tantrums are specifically a response when children don't feel understood. Offering empathy and understanding when the child is upset helps them feel connected and cared about, which minimizes tantrums.

## Frame of Reference: What Adults Feel Like

To understand what children experience, consider what you feel like when you're swept with exhaustion, rage, and hopelessness. If you lose it, you want someone else there:
- Holding things together
- Reassuring you
- Acknowledging your feelings
- Helping you get yourself under control

Your child needs to know that:
- You love them no matter what feelings they have
- As soon as they're ready, you'll help them recollect themselves

## Trust Your Instincts

The parent's instinct that the child "just needs some comfort and he'll be okay" is correct. When parents feel torn between comforting the child and fearing they are reinforcing bad behavior, they should trust the instinct toward comfort.

Comforting a distressed child will not make tantrumming worse - it will help the child feel understood, so they tantrum less. If the child cries, that's okay too, as long as the parent stays with them and helps them feel safe.
