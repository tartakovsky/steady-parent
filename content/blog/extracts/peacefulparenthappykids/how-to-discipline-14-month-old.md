# Discipline for Young Toddlers (14 Months)

## The Fundamental Paradigm Shift

**14 months marks a major transition** that requires parents to completely change their approach. The child is no longer a baby but a toddler. This means the child will now advocate fiercely for their needs. They comprehend a great deal but cannot yet express themselves verbally, which leads to frustration. The core insight is that discipline at this age must align with the toddler's developmental "job description" rather than fighting against it.

## The Three Developmental Jobs of Toddlers

Dr. Markham frames toddler behavior through three essential developmental tasks. Understanding these jobs reframes "misbehavior" as developmentally appropriate work.

### Job #1: Explore to Learn

**Toddlers must touch everything.** They NEED to pull things out of cupboards. This exploration literally stretches their IQ and develops creative, outside-the-box thinking. This is not optional or a behavior problem - it is essential developmental work.

**This phase is temporary.** The intense need to pull everything apart and explore will only last a few months, then the child moves on to other developmental priorities.

**The parent's response should be babyproofing, not discipline.** The goal is to say "No" as little as possible. Make a game of seeing if you can avoid saying "No" all day. If you babyproof properly, there should be almost nothing the child can't explore with a parent present for safety.

**Substitutes for "No" are acceptable:** Instead of "No," say things like "That's not for babies...Let's look at this instead."

**Concrete babyproofing strategies:**

- Clear knob covers for stove knobs
- Find a high shelf for the laptop when not in use - and importantly, **don't use the laptop around the toddler.** Using screens around them signals disconnection and that they aren't safe, which prompts acting up or whining to get your attention
- Put babylocks on cupboards with cleaning supplies and move breakables up high
- Put pans, plastic containers, and dishtowels in low cupboards. Let the child tear them out every single day and just clean up a couple times a day
- In the bedroom and bathroom, have a drawer or basket just for the child to explore while you're getting washed or dressed. Rotate cool stuff into it
- Make at least one room of the house completely safe so the child can explore to their heart's content without constant spotting

**The diaper pile technique:** Let the child pull the pile of diapers down. Make a game out of restacking them and knocking them down again. If you do this repeatedly over one day, the child will probably leave the diapers alone most of the time from then on. The principle: **satisfying the exploration urge fully extinguishes the need to repeat it.**

**Key insight about baby vs. toddler engagement:** A toddler is no longer a baby who can happily watch while you do housework. They need to be involved. Let them "wash" the floor with a wet sponge. Give them a spray bottle and a rag and let them clean the cupboards.

**The boredom-destruction connection:** Toddlers get bored sitting around the house and start tearing things apart when understimulated. The solution is giving them LOTS of opportunity to explore.

**Exploration activity ideas:**
- Take walks and let them look for worms and dig in the dirt
- Go to the library
- Find a grand building with steps they like and go up and down the steps fifty times
- If you have a yard, get a sandbox and wading pool
- Make playdoh
- Let them fingerpaint in the bathtub

### Job #2: Experiment and Test

**Testing limits is the toddler's job.** Sure, you said No yesterday, but maybe you won't say No today! The toddler's developmental task is to test things to figure out what they can change versus what is immovable. The parent's job is to patiently, repeatedly help them learn the limits that matter.

**The ratio matters:** Make sure the child's life is not mostly about frustration and limits, but about fun, exciting exploration.

**Being on the same side:** Convince the child that you're on their side so they become more willing to accept your limits. How? When you have to stop them from doing something, stay loving and compassionate.

**Reframe discipline as guidance:** Discipline means to guide. Think of yourself as the patient, loving guide for someone who doesn't yet know the rules and customs and doesn't understand the danger.

**The wall analogy for firmness:** Of course you have to be firm, just like the wall is firm. The child doesn't try to walk through walls because they've learned that every time they try, the wall stays firmly in place. So be consistent and firm. But that doesn't mean you have to be mean.

**Why meanness backfires:** If you're mean, the child will get distracted by your reaction and will be too busy fighting with you to learn the limit you're trying to set. **The emotional conflict prevents the learning.**

**Physical backup for limits:** When you set a limit, move in close and be kind but firm, and back it up physically. For instance, pick the child up in the parking lot if they don't want to hold your hand.

**The empathy-acceptance connection:** When you have to set a limit, EMPATHIZE. That will help the child accept the limit. Example language: "You wish you could climb up there, but it isn't safe...you're sad and mad...yes, you're crying, I hear how disappointed you are."

**Plan for reactions:** Every time you set a limit, expect the child will have a reaction, and you will need to "hear" that reaction with loving compassion. That is the only way they will come to accept your limits. If you don't acknowledge their reaction, they will keep fighting with you to get you to understand.

**Critical principle: Rage never dissipates until it feels heard.**

**Crying is processing:** If the child cries, that's fine. That's how they process their disappointment, sadness and anger. Hold them and empathize while they get it off their chest. Once they feel understood, they'll be more cooperative.

**Persistence timeline:** Plan that it will take the child at least a month of trying the same thing over and over, while you say No, before they stop trying it. This is normal and healthy.

**Reframe persistence positively:** You WANT your child to be the kind of person who is persistent in going after what they want - that's the only way they'll be successful in life.

**Strengthen the bond to increase limit acceptance:** How to strengthen and sweeten your bond:
- Roughhouse with the child to get them laughing
- Snuggle, which creates oxytocin

**Match support to expectations:** Give your child whatever support they need so they can meet your expectations. You will need to repeat yourself and keep your sense of humor. And if no amount of support helps your child meet your expectation, then **that expectation is not appropriate for your child yet.**

**Impulse control development:** You can't expect a 14 month old not to touch something you have left within their reach. They just don't yet have the brain development for that kind of impulse control. So move the tempting object and baby-proof rather than expecting self-control.

### Job #3: Develop a Sense of Agency (Positive Empowerment)

**Every child needs to know they can have an impact on the world.** When the child does something and you react strongly, they are affirmed in their ability to make things happen. That is such a joyful discovery that they laugh.

**They aren't trying to provoke you.** The child isn't trying to offend you, or hurt you, or make your life difficult. They assume you will be cheering too at their newfound power.

**Agency is the foundation of responsibility:** This sense of personal power is actually the beginning of their ability to take responsibility.

**Strategies to give appropriate autonomy and power:**

**Choices - with caveats:** You can show them both the blue cup and the red cup. But this only works if they care. The example given: Why should they care about which outfit they're going to wear? No wonder they walk away. And don't worry if they aren't quite ready for choices - there are other ways to help them discover their impact on the world and exercise autonomy.

**Let them lead:** As much as possible, let the child take the lead and be their assistant - at the playground, for instance. Let them stretch the limits of their body without you telling them to be careful (and yes, of course you spot them to be sure there is no real danger).

**The Chase game technique:** Give them power through play by finding a safe place and playing Chase games. This gets it out of their system so they don't have to run away from you when there are cars around. Toddlers love to run away and have us chase them. Tell them they are just too fast for you while you chase them all around. Finally, scoop them up and cuddle and delight in them.

**Avoid power struggles:** If you can let them do it without damage to property or infringing on someone else's rights, and without compromising their own health and safety, let them do it. This is not the time to get overly worried about them "learning lessons" if you have to fight with them to do it.

**Stay calm when setting limits:** When you need to set a limit, do it calmly or the child will act up again to see if they can get you to react again (for that sense of having an impact!). **Your big reaction feeds the behavior.**

## Never Punish - And Why

**NEVER punish.** If you punish, the child will fight you at every turn to prove that you can't control them.

**Punishment is unnecessary:** Why would punishment ever be necessary? If the child isn't learning from your telling them not to touch something, move it out of the way.

**What punishment actually teaches:** Punishing won't teach them not to touch it; it will teach them that you are sometimes, unaccountably, mean and cruel.

## The "No" Game Problem

When you say No and the child thinks it's a game even though you're clearly upset, and when you get down to their level and say no calmly but they think it's fun - this is the agency dynamic at play. Your reaction (whether frustrated or calm) is confirming their power to make things happen. The solution isn't a different way of saying No - it's removing the opportunity by babyproofing, providing alternatives, and saving No for when it truly matters.

## The Comprehension Paradox

Parents often note: "I know comprehension isn't an issue because he understands so much - I say let's go wash your hands and he walks to the bathroom." This apparent contradiction - understanding commands but ignoring limits - is explained by the three jobs framework. Understanding language doesn't equal having impulse control or being developmentally ready to accept frustration without testing.

## Bilingual Development Note

Children learning two languages at once may take longer to start speaking. This was validated by the parent's own experience - it took her longer to start speaking but when she did, she was speaking both languages. Pointing at things is an appropriate communication milestone during this period.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Saying "No" too often (creates a life that's mostly about frustration and limits)
- Slapping hands (punishment that teaches you can be mean and cruel)
- Using the laptop around the toddler (signals disconnection)
- Expecting impulse control (developmentally impossible at 14 months)
- Getting frustrated and showing big reactions (feeds the behavior through agency-seeking)
- Fighting over "learning lessons" (creates power struggles that don't teach)
- Not acknowledging the child's emotional reaction to limits (rage never dissipates until it feels heard)
- Offering choices the child doesn't care about (outfit choices may not matter to them)
- Expecting the baby-stage ability to watch while you do housework (toddlers need involvement)

## The Overall Frame

This is a wonderful age. The child's brain is expanding with learning every day. The parent's job is to support them differently than when they were a baby, so they can do their developmental work. Enjoy them.
