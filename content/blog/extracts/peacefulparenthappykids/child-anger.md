# Teaching Emotional Intelligence When Emotions Run High

Source: Dr. Laura Markham, Peaceful Parent Happy Kids

## Core Conceptual Framework

**Emotional intelligence** encompasses the abilities to soothe oneself, regulate emotions, and get along with others. When children wrestle with difficult human emotions, they require parental help to develop these capabilities. The moments when storm clouds brew represent the most important teaching opportunities for emotional intelligence.

### The Behavior-Needs Connection

Children want to have happy, warm interactions with their parents. They want to be "good" people. The foundational principle: **Misbehavior comes from overwhelming feelings or unmet needs**. If adults do not address the underlying feelings and needs, those emotions will burst out later, manifesting as other problem behavior.

### The Emotion Regulation Sequence

The path from emotion to behavior regulation follows a specific developmental sequence:

1. When we allow ourselves to feel an emotion, it begins to dissipate
2. When we try to push an emotion out of our awareness, it does not go away; we simply lose the ability to control it
3. The first step in learning to regulate emotions is to allow them and become aware of them
4. When children can regulate their emotions, they can regulate their behavior

## Strategy 1: Respond to the Needs and Feelings Behind Problem Behavior

### The Principle

Children usually cannot articulate their needs. When adults help children tune into their inner experience and provide language to express their needs, children develop self-understanding and learn how to advocate for themselves appropriately.

### Script for Clinginess (Connection Need)

**Situation**: Child has difficulty letting go of parent

"It's hard to let go of me this morning. Starting school again has been fun, but you miss time with Mommy now. I will be right here to pick you up after school, and we'll snuggle and play together and have special time, ok?"

This script names the underlying feeling (missing connection), validates it, and provides reassurance about future connection.

### Script for Crankiness (Nurture Need)

**Situation**: Child is cranky due to lack of sleep

"You're having a hard time this morning. I think everything is a bit too much for you because we all got to bed late last night and didn't get quite enough sleep. Maybe we need to spend some cozy time this morning on the couch reading books together."

This script identifies the physical cause (insufficient sleep), validates the resulting difficulty, and offers nurturing as the solution.

### Script for Defiance (Agency Need)

**Situation**: Child exhibits defiant behavior

"It looks like you want to do this yourself! I'm right here if you need some help."

This script reframes defiance as a healthy desire for autonomy and offers appropriate support without taking over.

## Strategy 2: Accept All Emotions, Even While Limiting Behavior

### The Dual Principle

Parents must limit children's actions (running in the street, throwing dinner, hitting siblings, excessive screen time). However, children are allowed to have and express all their emotions, including feelings of disappointment or anger in response to those limits.

### The Meltdown Function

Meltdowns serve as nature's release valve for children's emotions. Children need to show adults how they feel and have those feelings heard.

### Anti-Pattern: Isolation During Emotional Storms

Banishing a child to their room to "get under control" sends the message that they are alone with big, scary feelings. This approach undermines rather than builds emotional regulation.

### Script for Meltdown Support

**Situation**: Child is having a meltdown

"You seem so mad and sad right now. I am right here, you are safe."

The parent should either hold the child or stay near and connected with a soothing voice.

### Post-Storm Principle

Once the emotional storm passes, the child will be cooperative and affectionate, feeling more connected because the parent tethered them through their inner tornado. Ignore rage or rudeness during a meltdown; the child is showing the depth of their upset.

### Teaching Timing

The time to teach is AFTER the storm passes, not during. Minimal teaching is actually necessary once the child processes feelings, because the child already knows expected behavior; they simply could not control big emotions. Parental soothing support is the first step of learning self-regulation.

### The Regulation Path

When adults give children the message that all emotions are okay, children befriend their emotions instead of stuffing them. This acceptance allows children to begin self-regulating.

## Strategy 3: Regulate Your Own Emotions

### The Modeling Principle

Children will not always do what you say, but they will always, eventually, do what you do. **Kids learn emotional regulation from parents**. When parents stay calm, it teaches children that there is no emergency, even if it feels that way in the moment.

### Prerequisite for Parental Calm

You cannot stay calm when running on empty. Maintaining your own sense of well-being is one of the most important parenting responsibilities.

### Common Trigger Points

Most parents keep composure until the child gets upset, or when parents become upset at the child and begin disciplining. These moments require special attention.

### Reframe for Child's Upset

Parents do not have to "fix" or stop a child's upset. Instead, accept what the child is feeling while maintaining your own equilibrium.

### Anti-Pattern: Blame and Punishment

There is no reason for blame or punishment when setting limits. These approaches shame children and make them misbehave more. The goal: **firm limits set with empathy**.

### Script for Empathic Limit-Setting

**Situation**: Ending screen time for bed

"I'm sorry, Luis, I know it's hard to stop when you're having so much fun with your game. It's bedtime now, and you can play more tomorrow. Now it's time to say Goodbye, Game. Ok, I'm turning it off. I see that makes you very unhappy. You wish you could play all night, every night, don't you? I know it's hard. And I know you can handle it. Come on, let's make sure we have time for a story. What should we read tonight?"

**Script elements**: acknowledges difficulty, states limit, validates wish, expresses confidence in child's capacity, redirects to something positive.

### Why This Works

The child's brain actually learns to calm and soothe itself in response to the parent modeling self-regulation. When parents set limits with understanding of the child's perspective, the child is less likely to resist. When children give up what they want to follow limits, they build neural pathways for self-regulation.

## Strategy 4: Remember That Anger is a Defense Against Deeper Emotions

### The Core Insight

When a child expresses anger, they are not being rude. They are defending against feeling more vulnerable emotions of hurt or fear. The intervention: acknowledge the anger, then empathize with the deeper emotions spurring it. Feeling those deeper emotions makes the defensive anger unnecessary.

### Handling "I Hate You"

Hate is not a feeling but a "position" or stance assumed for self-protection. Do not get distracted by the nuclear option language. The child is showing the depth of their upset. Empathize as if the child were simply expressing anger.

### Script for "Hate" Directed at New Sibling

**Situation**: Child says they hate the new baby

"You say you hate the new baby? I hear you. Sometimes you get really mad at her just for being here. And I see how mad you are at me, too, for spending time with the baby. You liked it better when it was just you and me. You feel so sad that things are different now and I am so busy with the baby. Come snuggle with me and I will hold you and you can tell me your sad and mad feelings. When you're ready I will kiss your nose and toes and we can play baby games, just you and me, like we did when you were a baby."

**Script elements**: reflects the child's words without judgment, names the underlying feelings (sadness about change), offers physical connection, provides reassurance of continued special relationship.

### Why This Matters

Many parents had scary experiences with anger as young children, creating fear of their children's anger. Letting children know they are not bad for feeling rage helps them accept anger as normal and move through it rather than getting stuck. Understanding that anger is a defense gives children tools to dissolve it so they are not driven to lash out.

## Strategy 5: Grant Wishes Through Imagination When Desires Cannot Be Met

### The Mechanism

Research shows that the power of the mind is so great that imagining a wish being fulfilled actually satisfies the brain for the moment. Brain scans show the satisfaction center appearing satisfied even with imagined fulfillment. Giving a child their wish in imagination releases some of the urgency, making them more open to alternatives.

### Additional Function

This approach shows that you truly care about what the child wants and wish you could make them happy.

### Script for Cookie Request Before Dinner

**Situation**: Child wants a cookie before dinner

"You wish you could have a cookie. I bet you could gobble ten cookies right now! Wouldn't that be so yummy?!"

**Follow-up**: Find a way to meet the deeper need: "I think you're hungry. It's almost time for dinner but you can't wait. Let's find a snack that makes your body feel better."

### The Skill Being Built

All humans have desires that cannot be granted. Learning a repertoire of ways to manage those desires constructively, along with managing other needs and feelings, is an important coping tool for any child's emotional intelligence toolkit.

## Strategy 6: Don't Take It Personally, and Resist the Urge to Escalate or Retaliate

### The Reframe

Your child has big feelings. They are not about you, even when the child yells "I hate you!" It is about the child: their tangled feelings, their difficulty controlling themselves, their immature ability to understand and express emotions.

### Hearing "You NEVER Understand!"

Interpret this as information about the child: at this moment, they feel like they are never understood. It is not information about you.

### Response Protocol

Model emotional self-management by taking a deep breath and trying to see the situation from the child's perspective. Remember: it is hard to be a kid. The child does not yet have internal resources to manage emotions, but the adult does.

### The Adult's Job

The adult's job is always to calm the emotional storm rather than escalate it. This is how children learn to do this for themselves.

### Unconditional Love Message

When you are emotionally generous to your child, you demonstrate that they are not perfect, but you love them anyway, even when they are at their worst. This unconditional love is what every child needs to thrive.

## Overarching Principles

### The Personal Growth Opportunity

These skills are challenging because most adults find it difficult to manage their own feelings sufficiently to tolerate children's unruly emotions. However, this provides an opportunity for adults to grow in emotional intelligence themselves, becoming happier, healthier people.

### The Healing Possibility

If you received swatting instead of understanding as a child, it is never too late to have a happy childhood through this personal growth work.
