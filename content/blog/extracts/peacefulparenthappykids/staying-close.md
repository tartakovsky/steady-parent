# Staying Close to Your Tween Daughter

## The Tween Developmental Reality

**Eleven-year-old girls** can display a mix of challenging behaviors: moodiness, over-dramatizing, self-centeredness, intense focus on friends, being close-mouthed, surly, back-talking, and condescending to parents. They can also be mature, affectionate, and delightful. At their worst, they combine the most challenging aspects of toddlers and teens.

The underlying causes of these behaviors:
- **Hormonal flooding** in the developing body
- **Brain rewiring** during this developmental stage
- A powerful **need to discover themselves** and their place in the world, which temporarily takes precedence over family and schoolwork
- An inability to acknowledge how much they still love and need their parents, because they're working hard to feel "grown up" and independent

The strategic opportunity: If parents accept this new situation and adjust their parenting accordingly, the tween years are the perfect time to strengthen the relationship before the teen years arrive.

## Core Principle: You Must Change Your Parenting Approach

You cannot parent the way you did when she was little because it is neither appropriate nor effective. **Testiness from your daughter is a signal** that you need to adjust your parenting style to connect and listen more. This adjustment is needed precisely at moments when you want her to listen to you, which creates an inherent challenge.

## Building and Maintaining Connection

### Why Connection is the Foundation

You will get no respect if she doesn't feel connected to you. The relationship must be the priority. **Fight like the dickens to stay close to your daughter. Do not let her push you away.** She still needs you; she just cannot acknowledge it.

### Specific Connection Tactics

**Physical touch rituals:**
- Hug her hello every morning
- Hug her goodbye when she leaves for school (do this with a sense of humor and she will humor you)
- Greet her with delight and a hug when you see her again later in the day

**Bedtime connection:** She may not "need" tucking in at night, but that should not stop you from lying down next to her to discuss her day and having a few minutes of quiet connection. Many parents find that time just before bed is when their daughter is least distracted by other things and most willing to open her heart.

### Scheduled Quality Time

Create regular times, at least once a week, for dedicated connection activities such as brunch, a walk, a manicure, or kicking a soccer ball around. Make the most of these opportunities.

**What to do during quality time:**
- You do not have to always have deep conversations
- Simply appreciate and enjoy her
- Listen, listen, listen

**Critical warning about advice-giving:** The more you give her advice, the more she feels like you do not have confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself. Instead, ask good questions and empathize with the tough dilemmas she faces with friends, academics, and other choices.

## The Independence Balance

### Why Independence Matters

If you insist on controlling all her choices, you are inviting rebellion or worse. If you can find appropriate ways to give your daughter independence, she will not have to rebel against you to start standing on her own two feet.

### The Reality of Mistakes

She will make mistakes. That is how humans learn. She is not ready to make all her decisions, and you are still the parent. **Deciding how much to weigh in is the hardest part of this parenting dance.**

---

## Empathy and Perspective-Taking

### Why Her Reactions Seem Disproportionate

The upset of the moment may not seem like a big deal to you, but to her it feels like the end of the world. Her body is changing dramatically, which is worrisome at best and painful at worst (growing pains, menstrual cramps).

### How to Respond to Over-Dramatizing

When she over-dramatizes, offer empathy. Her stubbed toe may not have warranted all that fuss, but something does hurt and she wants you to kiss it and make it better, even if she is not exactly sure what is bothering her and how to put it into words.

## Anxiety About Adolescence

### Gender Differences in Anticipating Adolescence

Research finding: Tween boys look forward to adolescence, anticipating the strength, power, independence, and prestige they will develop. **Tween girls, on the other hand, dread adolescence**, fearing:
- Menstruation
- Their new vulnerability to men
- The pressure to be sexy and attractive

### The Internal Conflict

Most girls do not know how to put these anxieties into words, but they feel them, even as they beg to wear skimpy outfits so they will be "cool." Your daughter may want to be a "hottie" so other kids will be impressed with her, but inside she knows full well that she is not ready for the attention that will bring.

---

## Sleep Requirements

### The Sleep Minimum

Tweens and teens need a minimum of **nine hours of sleep each night**. A big contributor to the infamous moodiness of tweens and teens is that they do not get enough sleep.

**How to know if they are getting enough sleep:** If your child is not waking up naturally (without an alarm or a wake-up call from you), then they are not going to bed early enough to get enough rest.

### The Late Bedtime Cascade

When kids stay up late, their stress hormones like **cortisol** kick in, which makes it harder to fall asleep. The problem is that cortisol stays in the system and makes them edgy the next day. Cortisol also contributes to:
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Immune suppression
- Weight gain

The famous moodiness of teenagers is partly attributable to late bedtimes, which have become standard practice in our culture.

### The Analogy for Parental Control

Just because your toddler gains the ability to keep himself awake does not mean you would let him stay up half the night. Just because your tween and teen gain the ability to keep themselves up does not mean it is not bad for them.

### Addressing Sleep Difficulties

Introduce your tween to relaxation exercises if she is having a hard time falling asleep; they will come in handy for the rest of her life. But insist on a reasonable bedtime.

### Challenging the "Teen Body Clock" Research

What about research that the body clock of teens is set to stay up late? The researchers did not control for screen usage. When humans use blue light (phones, iPads, computers, TV) within an hour or two of bedtime, it suppresses melatonin and keeps us awake. Naturally, we then sleep later the next morning because young people do need more sleep than adults.

**The hypothesis:** As soon as researchers stop kids from using screens in those experiments, the kids will be on the same body clock as other humans. Why would they have evolved differently from the rest of us?

**Critical action:** Keep all screens out of bedrooms. This is true for adults also.

## Screen and Technology Management

### The Tween Transition to Screens

As tween girls begin to lose interest in pretend play and the other games that occupied their earlier years, many begin to spend more time on the computer. It is not unusual for them to fall into the grip of a computer addiction.

### Cell Phone Management

**First step:** Sign an agreement for responsible cell phone usage when you first give your child a phone. Be sure you are sitting down with your child daily to review the texts and other phone usage and talk about the choices your child is making.

### Social Media Limitations

Limit screen usage, especially social media. This will take constant awareness on your part and a great deal of discussion, but there is a lot at stake. **Social media use by teens has been linked to poor sleep patterns, depression, and anxiety.**

**The age rule:** Facebook and Instagram have a rule that users must be 13. Getting social media accounts when you are under 13 requires lying, which is enough reason for parents to nix it. This is one of the few times the culture will support you in your parenting, so take advantage of it.

### The Science of Game Addiction

Computer game manufacturers spare no expense and use very sophisticated testing to ensure that their games are physically addictive. This means that your child's body is bathed in adrenalin and other neurotransmitters as soon as she even thinks about playing her games. **Computer games actually change our brain chemistry while we are playing them, and we do not know how long the effects last afterwards.**

**The parental responsibility framing:** We do not expose our children to other addictions and leave them to fend for themselves. Kids need our help to manage this addiction too.

## Nurturing Passions

### Why Passions Matter

Anything she really cares about and can throw herself into is:
- **Protective**
- A place to feel competent
- A place to push herself and learn to manage frustration
- A way to build resilience
- A place to lose herself when the arrows of outrageous fortune pierce too deeply

Examples: dance, writing, drawing, and other creative or athletic pursuits. Do whatever it takes to encourage her.

### Critical Warnings About Passions

**It must be her passion:** It is critical that this be something she is drawn to, not something her parents are pushing.

**Avoid performance pressure:** Do not make her perform or submit to competitions. Let this be about engagement with her own passion, not performance.

---

## Physical Activity

### Benefits of Regular Exercise

Regular exercise has tremendous benefits:
- Getting the metabolism moving
- Balancing raging hormones
- Helping her fall asleep easily at night

Make a habit of physical activity every day, whether a bike ride, soccer game, family hike, or time on the treadmill.

### The Participation Reality

You will probably have to join in. Instead of resenting that, see it as a way to stay connected and get some exercise yourself.

## Talking About Relationships and Sex

### Why Conversations Are Protective

Your daughter is hungry for information about love and sex. Talking about it will not make her rush out and do it. **Research shows that the opposite is true:** Kids who do not have strong connections with their parents are the ones looking for love in all the wrong places.

### Building Openness

She needs to feel comfortable asking you about anything she wonders about or hears about from her friends.

### The Preemptive Strategy

Think preemptively. You want your daughter to feel great about her body so she is not looking to prove herself with choices that will shame her later. The best way to prevent that is for her to understand that challenging scenarios can happen, so she can walk out of any drama that is too much for her to handle.

---

## Discipline Approach for Tweens

### Why Punishment Stops Working

Parents who rely on punishment to control their kids (including timeouts and consequences) realize in the preteen years that it no longer works. In fact, it becomes clear that it is actually impossible to control them when they are out of your sight, which they often are.

### The Alternative: Repair Instead of Consequences

If you have been using punishment (such as consequences) and your child is now ten and acting disrespectful, introduce the idea of **"Repair" instead of "Consequences"** and focus on helping your child reflect on her choices so she can learn to make better ones.

## Managing Emotional Outbursts

### The "Don't Take It Personally" Principle

Tween and teen girls are famous for feeling like their parents "Just don't understand!" Try not to feel hurt by that. In fact, try not to feel hurt by anything she does or says. Most of it is not about you at all, but about:
- Her tumultuous hormones and emotions
- Her huge fears and insecurities
- Her urgent need to shape an identity as a separate, independent person

**Action:** Breathe through any "tantrums" and bite your tongue. The minute you get triggered, you are pushing her away.

### The Civility Balance

**What to do:** Insist on civility, but do it from as calm a place as you can muster. Do not overreact when your child raises her voice to you in the middle of hysterics over something. She will be deeply grateful, even if she cannot acknowledge it at the moment.

**What this is NOT:** This is not suggesting that you let your child treat you disrespectfully. It is suggesting you act out of love and connect with empathy, rather than anger, as you set limits.

### The Timing Principle

If you are too angry to get in touch with your love, always wait until you can do so before you set limits. Keep your own voice calm and warm, even when she does not.

### The Complete Response to Back-Talk

When she back-talks, politely remind her: "We don't talk to each other that way in this house." But then be sure to add: "You must be so upset to talk to me that way. What's going on, Sweetie?"

**The reasoning:** If you do not model self-control, you cannot expect it from her, and what is worse, you will lose her respect. If you can stay calm and "seek first to understand" (as Stephen Covey would say), she will finish her upset feeling closer to you, and she will be less likely to go on the attack next time.

### Understanding the Purpose of Outbursts

Kids this age have strong feelings that they need help to handle. If you can stay calm and listen for what is going on underneath her upset, you can use it as an opportunity to get closer.

**The safety paradox:** Not knowing what to do with their tumultuous feelings, tweens and teens often act out towards the people they feel safest with: their parents.

**The danger of reacting to disrespect:** If we get distracted by their disrespect, or react angrily, we miss the real message. If we can instead empathize, look for the upset under the disrespect, and remind them of who they really are ("You don't usually act unkindly"), we create an opening to help them manage their feelings.

## Maintaining Physical Closeness

### The Continued Need for Touch

Your preteen daughter's body is growing into womanhood, but she is still your little girl, and she still needs your physical closeness.

### If Parents Feel Uncomfortable

If you find yourself uncomfortable about holding her, observe your own anxiety and find a safe place to talk about it and work it out. Do not withhold from your daughter the touch all humans need, especially young humans.

**Warning:** You do not want her looking for love in all the wrong places.

---

## Course Correction and Repair

### Accepting Imperfection

No one parents perfectly. **Personal example:** "I found that about once a week I said exactly the wrong thing to my 12-year-old, and whatever upset she was already in would then erupt at me."

### Using Mistakes as Opportunities

Because of a commitment to calming rather than escalating the situation, these mistakes and misunderstandings can become opportunities to get closer. **Outcome example:** "By 14, she was calmer than I was, and a delight to parent."

### The Oxygen Mask Principle

We have to remember that it is like putting on our own oxygen mask first. We have to regulate our own emotions because they do not have the maturity to do it. They rely on us to act like grownups and model emotional self-management.

### Consequences of Walking Away Angry

If we walk away angry, our daughters feel:
- Wounded
- Misunderstood
- Alienated

They attack us, or build up resentment and distrust. A rift appears in the relationship, and if we do not respond quickly, it widens.

### The Repair Process

If we can back up, breathe, apologize, pay attention, and reconnect, we build bridges. The inevitable ruptures of daily life become opportunities to teach them many lessons:
- How to process their emotions
- How to repair an emotional rift
- How to problem solve
- That they can trust us

Most importantly, we end even the hard interactions with a stronger relationship. And they learn relationship skills they will use for the rest of their lives.

## The Parenting Responsibility Framework

Parenting is a lot of work, and the emotional work may be hardest with tweens and teens. It might seem unfair that you have to do most of the work in your relationship with your child, but that is the way parenting is. Our daughters may look like young women, but they have got a lot of growing up to do emotionally. **It is our job and our privilege to support them in that process.**
