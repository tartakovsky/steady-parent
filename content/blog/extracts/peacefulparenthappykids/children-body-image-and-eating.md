## What Body Image Is and Why It Matters

**Body image** is the way a child feels about their body. This encompasses feelings about physical challenges, skin color, size and shape, gender, and sexuality. Body image has a huge impact on a child's emotional well-being, which is why cultivating a healthy one matters so much.

## The Cultural Problem

Modern culture links a person's value to their appearance and normalizes images that don't represent most people - typically overly thin, young, Caucasian women. This creates a context where adult dissatisfaction with bodies is widespread and dieting is a major industry.

Children are affected by adult culture in two ways:

1. They absorb adult attitudes about bodies and appearance
2. They are subject to constant evaluative commentary about their own bodies - remarks about being "cute" or being big or small for their age - that would be considered rude if directed at adults

Research indicates that even preschoolers have increasingly negative body images. According to Dr. Jacqueline Harding, an advisor to a research group cited by The Telegraph: "By the age of three or four some children have already pretty much begun to make up their minds (and even hold strong views) about how bodies should look."

The likely culprits are:
- Images on TV
- Images in story books and animations
- General adult conversation about bodies, dieting, and cosmetic surgery

## The Parental Opportunity

Parents can have a major influence on children's development of a healthy body image. A truly healthy body image encompasses four interconnected elements:
- A healthy body
- A healthy emotional life
- A healthy attitude toward food and exercise
- A healthy self-perception of one's body

## Six Core Strategies

### 1. Don't Comment on Anyone's Body

When adults speak judgmentally about other people's bodies, children internalize those negative judgments. But the problem extends beyond negative comments. Even complimentary remarks about body shape or weight can be damaging over time. Frequent commentary on bodies - positive or negative - sends children the message that their bodies will be evaluated by others, making them overly concerned about their own appearance.

The principle: Avoid making bodies a topic of evaluation at all, because the very act of evaluation (regardless of whether the verdict is positive or negative) teaches children that bodies are meant to be judged.

### 2. Model Body Positivity

Children watch everything parents say and do. When speaking about your own body, speak lovingly about nurturing your health, strength, and well-being. The framing matters: your language should center on care and appreciation rather than criticism or appearance.

### 3. Confront Cultural Messages Directly

When a child says something negative about their body, the response should be:

1. **Ask what prompted it**: "What made you think of this?" You may be surprised at what is influencing them - discovering the source helps you understand what cultural messages they're absorbing.

2. **State your family values explicitly**: "In our home, we support our bodies with love and appreciation."

3. **Actively counter the negative with a positive exercise**: Challenge them to play a game where you each find ten things you love about your body. This shifts the child from criticism to appreciation through action.

### 4. Keep Your Family Physically Active

Children come to accept family habits as normal life, so establishing physical activity as routine makes it a default rather than something special or punitive.

**Critical framing**: Get outside and move for fun and health, not to look thin. Instead of communicating that exercise exists to tame body fat, explain that exercise keeps us healthier and happier in every way by changing our body chemistry.

**Implementation**: Insist on family physical activity every weekend, and actively participate with your child. The emphasis should be on shared movement and enjoyment, not on weight or appearance outcomes.

### 5. Nurture Healthy Eating Habits

Food choices become habits, which means what you serve matters long-term. Serve healthy snacks and meals from when your child is young. Reserve junk food for special occasions.

**Modeling requirement**: Your child watches everything you do, so improving your child's eating requires cleaning up your own eating habits and learning to genuinely enjoy healthy choices.

**What to avoid**: Experts suggest parents avoid dieting. This recommendation rests on two reasons:
1. Dieting doesn't work anyway (as a practical matter)
2. It sets a terrible example for children (as a modeling matter)

### 6. Restrict Media Images

Research shows that children with more media exposure have more negative body images. Complete media restriction isn't realistic, but you should actively discuss what children are seeing.

**Social media presents amplified risks**. These platforms expose children to:
- Filtered and edited images that create unrealistic beauty standards
- Algorithmic content that specifically serves increasingly extreme content about dieting, body modification, and appearance-focused messaging

The mechanism of harm: The constant stream of "perfect" bodies combined with algorithmic amplification of destructive content negatively impacts body image and can push children toward unhealthy behaviors as they try to match impossible ideals.

## Additional Considerations for Comprehensive Body Image

A healthy body image isn't only about weight and shape. It also includes:

- **Healthy racial identity**: How you talk with your child about race affects their relationship with their body and appearance
- **Healthy sexual and gender identity**: Though parents may not want to consider the word "sexuality" in relation to their child, a healthy body image includes a healthy sexual and gender identity

Both of these dimensions deserve intentional conversation and support.
