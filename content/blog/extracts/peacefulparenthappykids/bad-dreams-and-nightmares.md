# Understanding and Addressing Children's Nightmares

## The Nature of Childhood Nightmares

**Nightmares are common and usually not cause for concern.** Up to 10% of 7 and 8 year olds have nightmares once a week. A child experiencing nightmares is feeling afraid of something they are coping with in life. The basic response should be warm reassurance: empathize with the bad dream, help the child feel safe enough to return to sleep, and during waking hours ensure their life is not emotionally overwhelming.

**Recurring nightmares signal something different.** When the same theme appears repeatedly, it indicates the child is stuck trying to resolve something difficult. Nightmares function as a child's way of working through emotional content they cannot process consciously. Recurring nightmares are essentially the child's unconscious sending a message that they need help with something they cannot resolve on their own.

## Interpreting Dream Content

### Direct Interpretation

Often you can figure out what troubles your child by listening to their bad dreams. When you identify the fear, directly interpret it and provide reassurance.

**Example interpretations:**
- Dream about parent disappearing -> "It must have been very scary to dream that Mommy disappeared. But you know that Mommy ALWAYS comes back, right?"
- Dream about a neighbor's dog chasing -> "You've dreamed twice now that Mr. Jones' dog got loose and chased you. I know he always barks in that terrifying way when we pass their house. But he's just guarding his house, he wouldn't actually get out and hurt us, and you never walk over there without a grownup. We will always keep you safe."

### Looking for Real-Life Triggers

If the dream content does not reveal the source, consider whether anything traumatic happened in the past month:
- Separation or death
- Birth of a new baby
- New school or neighborhood
- Big changes, even happy ones (like a long-absent parent making contact)
- Witnessing parents arguing
- A parent who travels frequently

**Important finding from research:** Children who are punished with physical discipline or frequently yelled at are more likely to have frequent nightmares.

### The Projection Mechanism

**Sometimes nightmares express the child's own anger projected outward.** When children cannot handle feelings that scare them, those feelings get pushed away and return at night. Dreams where something scary is hurting the child may actually express the child's own anger at others. The child may be frightened of their own anger and projecting it onto dream monsters.

**Concrete example from the source:** A child who adores her cat dreams of mean cats, magical cats, and a witch with cat eyes. This was traced to the child being angry at her grandmother (who made her feel guilty about not wanting to pray) but feeling guilty about that anger. Because the child loves her cat, the anger got projected onto cats in the dream - expressing the fear that someone she loves could act like a monster.

**How to address this:** Make sure the child knows that everyone gets angry sometimes, even so angry they feel they could hurt someone, and that you will always help them manage their anger so everyone stays safe.

## Environmental and Media Factors

### Media Exposure

**Research shows kids who watch TV have more nightmares than kids who do not.** All children are different, and some are extra sensitive to scary images. Even Disney movies are too scary for some seven year olds. The recommendation is to limit media intake.

### Home Environment

**Anxious children are more likely to have bad dreams.** If your child is generally anxious, provide a secure home base and family, teach relaxation skills and positive thinking skills, and do not push them toward independence or challenges beyond their developmental level until they show readiness.

## Active Intervention Strategies

### Empowerment Through Dream Control

**Teach the child they can influence their dreams.** After empathizing ("No wonder you were scared!"), introduce these concepts:
- You can change what happens in a dream by telling the scary thing to go away
- You can call for help in a dream and help will always come
- Parents will always come if called in a dream
- You can wake yourself up if the dream is scary

### Rewriting the Dream Script

**Help the child come up with alternate endings to their nightmares.** If they struggle to start, brainstorm together. The goal is to give them a sense that they are the architect of their dreams.

**Example alternate endings:**
- "You call me and I appear and fight off the scary thing and then you and I go exploring and find a treasure"
- "You tell that scary thing not to be rude, or you will tell its mommy, and then send it home to dinner!"
- "When you feel yourself falling, you start floating, and then flying, and swooping about having a lovely time"
- "When the dragon roars at you, you roar right back and tame it, and then you have a pet dragon to be your friend"

**Keep the tone light-hearted.** Encourage creative solutions that transform the situation or even transform the scary dream monster.

**Critical warning: Do not encourage violence in dream solutions.** Once kids see violence as a viable option, they may begin using it in their waking life.

### Creative Processing Activities

**Have the child draw the dream with the new, rewritten ending.** This helps reprogram the unconscious to see the situation differently.

**Alternative: Act out the dream physically.** Let the child take the lead in changing the ending so they triumph. Cast other family members in various roles if needed. Acting out dreams has enormous power even though it may seem artificial.

### In-the-Moment Response

**When the child awakens upset:**
1. Hold them and tell them you will protect them from anything scaring them
2. Find out what it was (they may not be ready to share the whole dream)
3. Address the scary thing directly and loudly: "GO AWAY DREAM CATS! This is [child's name]'s bedroom, and you are not allowed here. GET OUT!"
4. Encourage the child to bellow this with you

This creates a sense of empowerment and makes it easier to return to sleep.

## Daily Practices for Prevention

### Connection and Communication

- Ensure plenty of snuggle time with parents
- Give the child a chance to chat about the best thing that happened that day
- Also discuss the worst things that happened
- Listen deeply and empathize
- Help them figure out how to solve their problems rather than solving problems for them

### Calm Environment

Keep the home calm, especially at bedtime.

## When to Seek Professional Help

**If all the above suggestions do not reduce or eliminate nightmares, the child's unconscious is signaling they need more help.** At this point, consult with a professional. The underlying principle is that nightmares reflect what the child is struggling with, and until those issues are resolved in real life, they will continue appearing in dreams.
