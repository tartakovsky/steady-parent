# Understanding and Responding to a Child's Acting Out Behavior

## The Core Insight: Misbehavior Is Communication

**All misbehavior is a communication about something the child needs.** When a child "acts out," it is because they cannot articulate their feelings. The behavior itself is their only available means of expressing what's happening inside. It functions as an SOS signal to parents.

Children don't understand the big feelings that overwhelm them and drive their bad behavior. They feel terrible when they can't be the child their parents want them to be, even if they appear not to care. The apparent indifference is part of the defense, not the reality.

When a child says "I hate you! You're the worst Mom/Dad in the world!" - they are actually communicating something like: "I'm overwhelmed with some big feelings here. I don't know what to do with them. They're bubbling up inside me and I feel so scared and sad and mad. I'll do anything to make these feelings go away, including hit someone. Don't come close offering hugs because that would send me right into tears. I feel safe when I'm with you, and that makes all these feelings even more intense. It must be your fault I'm feeling all these bad feelings! I'll drive you away by any means necessary."

This internal monologue reveals several important dynamics:
- The child feels overwhelmed and confused by their emotions
- They are experiencing multiple emotions simultaneously (fear, sadness, anger)
- Physical aggression is an attempt to discharge feelings they can't process
- Offers of comfort feel threatening because they would trigger vulnerability
- The child's sense of safety with the parent actually intensifies the emotional experience
- Pushing the parent away is a defensive mechanism, not a genuine desire for distance

## The Healing Mechanism: How Emotional Release Works

**The body knows how to heal itself once emotions are allowed to surface.** When a child feels safe, the stored emotions - hurt, powerlessness, worry about not being good enough to merit love - that have been stuffed all day, all week, all year, will bubble up.

The process works like this:
1. Child feels safe with parent
2. Previously suppressed emotions rise to the surface
3. Tears and fears are expressed and released
4. Anger, which was serving as a defense against these vulnerable feelings, is no longer needed
5. The anger melts away along with the tears and fears
6. The child feels much better, as anyone does when they work through a troubling emotion
7. Better feelings lead directly to better behavior

This explains why the goal is not to stop the difficult emotions but to help the child move through them completely.

## Creating Safety: The Foundation of Emotional Healing

### The Empathy and Emotion Coaching Approach

The first step in creating safety is to empathize and emotion coach. Use language like: "This day really isn't going the way you wanted! You didn't want ________. You wish that________. Do I have that right?"

**This acknowledgment alone might be enough to get cooperation.** Children don't need to get everything they want, but like everyone, they need to be acknowledged. The validation of their experience is the critical element, not agreement with their demands.

### Handling the Escalated Response

Sometimes the child will respond to empathy by launching into an anguished account of how unfair life is and what a terrible parent you are. This is not disrespect - this is the child communicating their pain in the only way they know how.

The parent's role at this point:
- Just listen
- Nod
- Acknowledge: "So you feel like I'm being unfair when... No wonder you're upset... You wish I would..."
- Do not change your decision (and most of the time, you shouldn't)
- Simply acknowledge the child's perspective

Then give a hug and say something like: "Sweetie, thanks for explaining that to me. I see how important this is to you and why you're upset. I'm sorry we can't do it your way. This is the way it is this time, because it's important to me that ________. But I do hear you. Let me think about it, and we'll talk about it again."

### What the Child Learns Over Time

Through this process, the child learns they don't get everything they want, but they get something better: **a parent who listens and understands, and loves them, even with all their upset feelings.**

Over time, as the child learns that the parent really will think about it and look for win/win solutions, they become more likely to go along with parental requests. Trust builds through demonstrated follow-through.

## Two Primary Strategies: Laugh or Cry

When empathy is met with more upset, it means the feelings are big and the child needs help moving through them. There are two main approaches: **Play when you can; Cry when you have to.**

The timing distinction is important: play works on a daily basis for emotional maintenance, or when conflict begins but before it becomes too big to laugh about. Once the child is past the point where play can help, it's time for crying.

## Strategy 1: Laughter and Play

### Daily Emotional Maintenance Through Roughhousing

**Every child needs a roughhousing session of giggling every day, just for emotional maintenance.** Giggling releases the same anxieties (fears and stresses) that crying does, but is much more enjoyable.

### The Bonding Effect of Physical Play

Physical play releases oxytocin and other bonding hormones, which reconnects parent and child and repairs the erosion in the relationship caused by daily life. The reconnection happens at a hormonal level, not just a behavioral one.

### Processing Fears Through Play

If the giggling comes from games that help the child process fears (like chase games or bucking bronco), it also works through any backlog of emotion. These games create mild fear in a safe context, allowing stored anxiety to discharge through laughter.

### Playful Limit-Setting

When a child is acting up, keeping your sense of humor and setting the limit playfully can help her feel reconnected, which makes her want to cooperate.

**Example:** If a child puts shoes on the couch, instead of a stern correction, try: "Whoa, Girlfriend! Shoes don't go on the couch! What do you think this is, a barn? Moooo...Mooo...!" Take her shoes off and get her to make animal noises with you. Crisis averted, connection repaired.

The playfulness transforms a power struggle into a moment of connection, changing the child's motivation from resistance to cooperation.

### Important Warning About Tickling

**Tickling doesn't seem to provide this emotional release.** The laughter from tickling is automatic physiology, as opposed to the psychological process that happens when mild fear releases through giggling.

Tickling, even when children giggle, often makes kids feel powerless. The child may seem to be having fun, but they can't HELP laughing - the response is involuntary.

**Alternative approach:** If a child begs for tickling, try "threatening" to tickle by moving your hand close but not making contact. This still elicits giggles, but they're psychological rather than physical. The child retains agency and the fear-release mechanism can work properly.

## Strategy 2: Crying and Emotional Release

### When Crying Is Needed

If the child is so wound-up that a playful overture would make him mad, then he's past the point where play can help. It's time to cry.

Behind that anger, tears are already welling up. If the parent can help the child feel safe enough, he'll go past the anger to the healing tears that will wash away all his upset.

### Creating Safety for Tears Through Compassion

How to help the child feel safe enough to cry:
- Don't take anything he says personally
- Don't let your buttons get pushed
- Don't feel you have to "correct" his rudeness right now - there will be time for that later
- Get in touch with your deep love for him
- Summon up as much kindness as you can
- Then empathize: "This is hard, I know... You wish... I'm sorry, Honey. I see how unhappy this makes you."

### Handling Yelling and Resistance

If the child yells back at you, that's okay. Stay compassionate: "You must be so upset to use that tone of voice with me. What's wrong, Honey?"

If the parent can stay compassionate rather than attacking back, the child will probably burst into tears.

### The Role of the Parent During Crying

Once tears come:
- Welcome them
- Hold him if he'll let you, or just stay nearby
- Don't try to talk
- Breathe
- Remind yourself that your role is to help him cry by providing an emotional safe space
- Talking would shut off the tears, and he needs to show them to you

**The goal during crying is to tap into as much upset as possible, to help the child empty that full backpack of feelings that have been making him so demanding or rigid.** The parent is facilitating complete emotional release, not just partial venting.

### Addressing Disrespect Later, Not During the Episode

Should you reprimand him for disrespect? Not during the emotional episode. Just create safety.

Later, he'll probably apologize without prompting. If he doesn't, have a conversation about:
- How upset he was
- How hard it is to be respectful when you're angry
- How you nonetheless expect him to try to express his needs and wants without attacking, just like you do
- How he never has to be rude to get you to listen to him

The correction is separated from the emotional moment, allowing the child to receive it when they're regulated rather than defensive.

## Why This Is Hard for Parents

**Many parents were told to stop crying when they were little - maybe not so sweetly.** This childhood training means the child's crying may make the parent anxious, ready to shut it down at any cost.

But emotions only go away once we feel them. Until we do, they're stuck in the body, bubbling up and driving behavior.

The child really needs the parent to accept their emotions and help them breathe their way through them. This is the path back to their natural sense of well-being and connection - **the only foundation from which they can choose to "act right."**

Behavior change comes from emotional regulation, which comes from emotional release, which comes from feeling safe enough to be vulnerable. The sequence cannot be reversed or shortcut.
