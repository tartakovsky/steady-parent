# Eye Contact During Nursing: Individual Baby Preferences

## Core Principle: Babies Communicate Their Needs

**Not all babies want eye contact while nursing, and this is completely normal.** The absence of eye contact during nursing is not a cause for concern when the baby makes eye contact easily and happily at other times.

The key insight is that babies are individuals with different preferences. What works for bonding with one baby may not be what another baby prefers or needs.

## Why Some Babies Avoid Eye Contact While Nursing

**Nursing may be a time when babies prefer less stimulation.** Some babies close their eyes or look away during nursing because they want to focus entirely on the physical pleasure of feeding. This is a form of self-regulation - the baby is managing their sensory input.

**The analogy offered:** "Don't force your baby to look at you while he's nursing. Would you want to be tapped on the shoulder while you're making love?" This comparison illustrates that nursing is an intimate, pleasurable experience where the baby may not want additional stimulation or interruption.

## Developmental Changes to Expect

**Eye contact preferences during nursing can change over time.** A baby who shows no interest in eye contact while nursing at 5 months may INSIST on eye contact by 8 months. This demonstrates that:
- Baby behaviors are phase-dependent
- Current patterns do not predict permanent traits
- Parents should not try to "fix" a behavior that may naturally evolve

**Long-term outcome evidence:** The author shares that her own son, who went through a similar phase in babyhood, grew up to be "a very communicative, easy to connect with person who makes great eye contact" (now in college). This serves as reassurance that avoiding eye contact during nursing does not indicate future social or attachment problems.

## What NOT to Do

**Do not try to force or encourage eye contact during nursing** when the baby is not seeking it. The baby is already communicating their preference, and parents should trust that communication.

## Indicators That Everything Is Fine

A baby who:
- Makes eye contact easily and happily at other times
- Is happy, healthy, and social in general
- Shows contentment during nursing (even without eye contact)

...is demonstrating secure attachment and appropriate social development. The nursing-specific behavior is simply a preference, not a warning sign.

## Trust the Baby's Communication

**The underlying philosophy:** "As always, you can trust her to let you know what she needs." This reflects a broader parenting approach that positions babies as competent communicators of their own needs. When the baby looks away during nursing, they are communicating that they are content and want to focus on the experience without additional interaction.
