## Benefits of Reading with Preschoolers

**Shared bonding activity**: Reading with your preschooler creates a meaningful shared experience that both parent and child enjoy. The activity serves dual purposes - it strengthens the parent-child connection while simultaneously building foundational literacy skills.

**Foundation for independent reading**: Regular reading sessions with preschoolers prepare them for future independent reading success. This early exposure to books, language patterns, and the mechanics of reading (holding books, turning pages, following text) creates familiarity that translates into reading confidence later.
