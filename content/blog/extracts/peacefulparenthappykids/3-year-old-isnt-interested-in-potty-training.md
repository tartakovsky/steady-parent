## Summary

Guidance for parents whose 3-year-old shows no interest in potty training despite having the ability to use the toilet. The advice focuses on avoiding power struggles and using peer influence as motivation.

## Key Concepts

### Late Trainers
- Children who aren't bothered by wet or dirty diapers tend to be late trainers because they lack internal incentive
- External rewards like stickers and candy tend to be short-lived if the child doesn't have internal motivation
- Average potty training age for boys is 38 months, but this includes both early and late trainers

### Bodily Autonomy
- Potty training is fundamentally a "my body, my way" situation
- Parents cannot win a power struggle over the child's body
- Forcing the issue creates battles that benefit no one

## Actionable Strategies

### Use Peer Influence
- Regularly expose the child to older children who use the toilet
- Children are naturally motivated by wanting to be like bigger kids
- Arrange playdates or activities where the child can observe peers using the bathroom

### Frame It as a Developmental Milestone
- Talk about using the toilet as something that happens "when you're ready"
- Compare it to other future skills like riding a bike or reading
- Keep tone relaxed and non-judgmental

### Use Natural Incentives
- Connect desired activities to potty training readiness (swimming classes, impressing teachers)
- Make underwear seem like a privilege of growing up rather than a requirement

### Timing Considerations
- Summer is ideal for potty training because children can go bottomless
- This makes the process easier and more natural

## Example Language

- "That boy doesn't wear diapers anymore. I bet he's three and a half or four."
- "When you're ready to use the toilet instead of diapers, then if you want we can take a swimming class."
- "When you're ready to wear underwear every day, your teacher will be so impressed."

## Core Principle

Sidestep the battle entirely. By removing pressure and allowing the child to come to readiness on their own timeline (while providing motivation through peer exposure), parents avoid conflict and the child typically trains easily and effortlessly.
