## Core Concept: Why Parents React Differently to the Same Situations

The central question is why some parents can maintain humor and composure when facing challenging child behavior, while others immediately start yelling. Why some parents torment themselves with criticism, worry, and doubt while others can relax and enjoy their children.

Two main factors determine parental reactions:

1. **Stress level** - When under stress, everyone becomes less patient. This is straightforward and situational.

2. **Thoughts and attitudes (interpretation of situations)** - This is the deeper factor. The way we interpret what's happening determines our response. One parent might respond to a child's rudeness with quiet dignity and curiosity about why the child is so upset. Another parent might get triggered, assuming that defiance is dangerous and needs to be quashed.

The key insight: We don't even notice these beliefs because they are usually unconscious and were often shaped in early childhood.

## How Childhood Experiences Create Adult Triggers

### Pattern 1: Harsh Reactions to Getting Upset -> Treating Child's Emotions as Emergencies

If your parents reacted harshly when you got upset as a child, you may have concluded that getting upset is an emergency. As a result, you now go into fight or flight when your own child gets upset.

**The dangerous catch**: When you're in "fight" mode, your child looks like the enemy. This causes you to escalate the drama and make everything worse - the opposite of what you intend.

### Pattern 2: Not Being Respected -> Perceiving Disrespect Everywhere

If you weren't treated with respect when you were young, you often grow into an adult who perceives others as disrespecting you. This triggers angry reactions to even the slightest perceived disrespect - even from a three year old.

### Pattern 3: Not Being Good Enough -> Perfectionism and Self-Criticism

If you concluded as a child that you simply weren't good enough the way you were, you'll probably set impossibly high standards and torment yourself with self-criticism.

**The deeper harm**: Perfectionism always sabotages the unconditional love children need. Children always sense when we don't accept them as they are. This creates a cycle where your childhood wound gets passed on.

### Pattern 4: Social Trauma -> Difficulty Helping Child with Social Problems

If you were bullied or socially ostracized as a child, you may get triggered when your own child has social difficulties. Being triggered makes it more difficult to help your child constructively, because you're dealing with your own emotional reaction rather than thinking clearly about what your child needs.

## The Universality of Triggers

**Virtually all of us have triggers**, unless we've done a lot of work on ourselves. Even if your parents were loving and responsive, most people drew some conclusions from childhood experiences that don't serve them as adults.

This is not about having bad parents. It's about the nature of how memories and emotions are processed.

## The Brain Science of Unprocessed Memories

### Normal Memory Processing

Usually when we process memories (which happens during sleep), the emotions associated with the memory are stripped away. This explains why once we sleep on something for a few nights, it typically isn't so upsetting anymore. The memory becomes integrated into a neural network that stores related memories.

### What Happens with Overwhelming Experiences

There were bound to be times when you experienced something that was overwhelming for you. Because it was so overwhelming, your brain wasn't able to process that experience in the usual way.

When the memory was so upsetting that your brain couldn't process it normally, the memory was stored unprocessed - with all the emotions you felt at the time attached to it.

### How Triggers Work

When you experience something similar to that original event - maybe not in actual content, but in the way it makes you feel - you are suddenly swamped with body sensations that are an over-reaction.

**Critical insight**: Those feelings aren't actually from the present experience. They are stored with that earlier unprocessed memory, which is getting triggered by the current experience.

## The Evolutionary Purpose of This Mechanism

Your psyche stores overwhelming memories this way for a survival reason. If you had a bad experience with a snake in childhood, you're more likely to stay alive later in life if you remember that experience with all the fear you felt initially. There may have been a time when some mild form of PTSD was beneficial to survival.

### Why It Doesn't Work for Modern Parenting Challenges

This mechanism fails us in situations like:

- **Social/professional situations**: Being humiliated by a teacher in childhood might make you quake when you have to speak up at a staff meeting as an adult.

- **Parent-child interactions**: If the original experience was being frightened of, yelled at, or hit by a parent, and those memories were stored unprocessed, then when your own child yells at you or hits you, it triggers all those feelings of fear and feeling victimized that you felt as a child.

**The result**: You can't think clearly. You freeze, or you lash out - either verbally or physically. Neither response is what you would choose if you were fully conscious and aware.

## The Emotional Backpack Metaphor

Most of us have unprocessed emotions from childhood. Another way of saying this is that we're lugging these unprocessed feelings and memories around in our **emotional backpacks**.

This unconscious "baggage" will inevitably get triggered as we go through life. When triggered, it sends us right into our unconscious, meaning we do and say things that we would never do if we were fully conscious and aware.

### Why Children Are Especially Triggering

Because these are childhood experiences, our children have an uncanny ability to trigger us. The parent-child dynamic recreates the emotional dynamics of our own childhood, making children uniquely positioned to activate our unprocessed memories.

## The Path Forward

**Healing triggers is possible.** The article establishes that these patterns can be changed, though the specific methods are covered in a follow-up piece.

The implication is that awareness of your triggers is the first step - understanding where your reactions come from allows you to begin the work of processing those stored emotions rather than continuing to react from them.
