## Core Principle: Address the Underlying Need, Not Just the Behavior

The fundamental approach to stopping toddler aggression toward older siblings is to get curious about what feelings and needs are driving the behavior, then address those root causes. Simply stopping the hitting in the moment is not enough - you need to understand why it's happening to change the pattern.

**Why toddlers hit:** Toddlers lack a fully developed prefrontal cortex, which means their emotions routinely overcome their knowledge that "hitting hurts." Additionally, they often cannot express themselves well verbally, leading to easy frustration and physical lashing out.

**Why you cannot "let them work it out":** The older child deserves to feel safe in their own home. Parents cannot be passive observers when a toddler is aggressive.

**Immediate response formula:** When aggression occurs, immediately get between your children to stop the hitting. Say "Ouch! No hitting! Hitting hurts!" Then move to addressing the underlying cause.

## Six Root Causes and Their Specific Solutions

### 1. The Toddler Wants to Connect With the Older Sibling

**What this looks like:** The toddler crashes into the older sibling or disrupts a project they're concentrating on. This is clumsy but represents an attempt to get the older sibling's attention.

**Why this happens:** The toddler wants their big sibling's attention and doesn't know appropriate ways to get it. Crashing into someone or their project guarantees a response.

**Solution - Teach positive interaction initiation:**
- Say: "Ouch! No hurting your sister! Are you trying to get your sister's attention? Use your words! Say 'Tara, here I am! Play with me!'"
- The goal is to give the toddler an alternative script for getting attention.

**Supporting the older child:**
- It is not the older child's responsibility to play with the younger child. Sometimes they will not want to.
- Give the older child a safe place to work on projects without toddler "help."
- Coach the older child on graceful deflection: "Yes, I see you! Do you want to play with this spaceship? It goes Vroom!"
- Do not leave the older child to fend off the toddler alone. Be available to run interference when needed.
- Offer the toddler connection with you as an alternative when the older sibling is unavailable.

### 2. The Toddler Wants What the Older Sibling Has

**Solution - Teach basic social skills:**
- Say to the toddler: "Ouch! No hitting! It looks like you want the giraffe your brother is playing with? You can ask him for a turn. Say 'Turn, please!'"
- You will probably need to "help" the toddler wait quite often - siblings will not always want to give a turn right away.

**Getting buy-in from older siblings:**
- Explain to your other children: If they can give the toddler a turn when she asks, she's more likely to use words instead of fists.
- When they don't need the item at that moment, it's helpful to let the toddler use it briefly.
- This creates a reinforcement loop: the toddler learns that asking works, which makes asking more likely in the future.

### 3. The Toddler is Retaliating for Provocation

**What this looks like:** The toddler responds to the older sibling's teasing, subtle aggression, toy-grabbing, or mean faces with physical aggression.

**Solution - Set limits on both sides:**

**Step 1: Connect with both children**
- Put an arm around each child
- Say: "I see two upset people here... you are having a hard time, aren't you? I'm so sorry I wasn't here to help you both... Can you tell me about it?... I see."
- The phrase "I'm so sorry I wasn't here to help you both" models taking responsibility.

**Step 2: Acknowledge the older child's pain**
- To the older child: "Your brother scratched you. Ouch... That hurts... I'm so sorry."

**Step 3: Set the limit with the toddler and teach alternatives**
- To the toddler: "Scratching hurts! Ouch! No scratching... Were you mad at your brother? Use your words... Say 'I'm MAD!' Can you say that right now? Yes, you're mad! Tell us in words, or stomp your foot, like this! And no scratching, right? No scratching!"
- Offer physical but non-harmful alternatives like stomping feet.

**Step 4: Address the older child's provocations**
- To the older child: "Making faces like that can really hurt someone's feelings and make them feel so mad they want to hurt. If you're upset at your sibling, tell them what you need, instead of provoking them."
- The key insight: Teasing and subtle provocations are real causes of retaliation. Both children need guidance.

### 4. The Toddler is Generally Unhappy and Taking It Out on Siblings

**What this looks like:** The toddler often seems unhappy and angry, and this spills over into aggression toward siblings.

**Why this matters:** Toddlers have strong feelings, but they generally have sunny personalities. Persistent unhappiness signals something is wrong.

**Solution - Investigate and provide preventive maintenance:**

**Physical causes:** Do detective work to identify if there's something physically wrong.

**Emotional causes:** The toddler may be super-sensitive and have tears and fears stored up that need to come out.

**Preventive maintenance approach:** Use empathy, connection, laughter, and emotion coaching to help your toddler with big feelings. This prevents the irritability that leads to sibling aggression. The goal is proactive emotional support, not just reactive intervention.

### 5. The Toddler is Jealous of Parent-Sibling Interactions

**What this looks like:** Aggression spikes when the parent is engaging with the older sibling.

**Solution - Increase connection with the toddler:**

**Daily one-on-one time:** Every child needs daily one-on-one time with each parent, without siblings around. Find time every day for just the two of you to be close.

**Physical roughhousing:** Initiate lots of playful physical roughhousing that gets your toddler laughing. This triggers oxytocin (the bonding hormone), strengthening the parent-child bond.

**Preemptive filling of the love tank:** Before engaging with your older child (for instance, to help with homework), focus on the toddler for five minutes. Fill their "love tank" and get them busy with a toy or activity. This reduces the sense of competition and loss when attention shifts to the sibling.

### 6. The Toddler Just Wants to Be Heard

**Why this happens:** Sometimes toddlers lash out physically because they don't know how else to get their point across. Hitting becomes a communication tool when words fail.

**Solution - Teach self-advocacy words:**
- Practice words like "Stop!" and "Move please!" with your toddler.
- Make it a fun game to ensure the words become automatic.
- The goal: The toddler doesn't have to hit to be heard because they have verbal tools.

## Playful Solutions for Specific Scenarios

**For the toddler who climbs on the older sibling's back and won't get off:**
- Teach the older child "bucking bronco" moves.
- Safety constraint: Wild horses only buck their riders onto the couch.
- This transforms a frustrating situation into play while keeping everyone safe.

## Key Underlying Concepts

**The connection-aggression link:** Many forms of toddler aggression stem from unmet connection needs, whether with the older sibling or with the parent. Increasing connection often reduces aggression.

**Teaching alternative behaviors:** Every correction should include a replacement behavior. Don't just say "no hitting" - give the toddler something specific to do instead (words, stomping, asking for turns).

**The older child's needs matter too:** The older child deserves protection and should not be left to manage toddler aggression alone. However, they also need coaching on how to interact constructively.

**Both-and approach to conflict:** When there's been provocation, address both children. The toddler's aggression is not okay, AND the older child's teasing or subtle aggression is also not okay.

**Preventive vs. reactive parenting:** Much aggression can be prevented through daily connection, one-on-one time, and emotional support. Waiting until aggression happens to intervene is less effective than building the foundation that prevents it.
