## Core Insight: The Child Is Not a Monster

When a child hits a younger sibling without visible anger, appearing to do it "for the fun of it" with a blank expression, parents often fear their child is becoming a cold-blooded bully or a monster. This interpretation is wrong and counterproductive.

**The blank expression is a sign of emotional numbing, not enjoyment.** The child is trying NOT to feel at those moments. What the child actually feels, such as fear of not being good enough compared to the baby, grief over losing their special place in the family and in the parent's heart, is so overwhelming that the child cannot bear it. When these feelings start to swamp the child, they lash out to avoid feeling them. The blank face is the face of someone trying to numb themselves.

A child showing this pattern is demonstrating that they feel like a monster inside and knows they cannot trust their parents to understand their "monstrous" feelings. So they push all those terrible feelings down, but in doing so, they also push away their good feelings and disconnect from parents and empathy alike.

**Key reframe:** Although the child is acting monstrously, they are not a monster. This is a beloved child showing in the only way they know that they desperately need help.

## Why Traditional Approaches Fail

### The "Make Better Choices" Fallacy

Most parents see "bad" behavior and think the child should be able to "make better choices." But **emotions always drive behavior**, and young children need help with their big emotions, or they genuinely cannot control their behavior. This is not a discipline or willpower issue; it is an emotional regulation issue.

### Why Punishment Makes Things Worse

When parents are triggered by their child's aggression (because unbearable feelings swamp them too), they lash out to avoid their own feelings, just like the child does. They punish the child or sternly say "No hitting! Hitting hurts!" and hope that ends it.

**Except it does not end it.** The child still has all those monstrous feelings warring within against their affection for the sibling. They will pat the baby gently and coo over her, then to their own shock find themselves gripped with desire to clobber her. This internal war between love and overwhelming negative emotions is the real problem, and punishment does nothing to address it.

Every time the child lashes out instead of patting gently, they deaden their empathy. Every time a parent responds with anger, the child's heart hardens more. The mask of numbness thickens into a fortress.

### Why "Attention" Alone Is Not Enough

Many experts suggest spending more time with the child, and this is essential. However, "attention" alone is insufficient to heal what is happening. The child's emotional "cup" is empty, but filling it is difficult because **the child cannot take in love**. First, trust, safety, and connection must be built, and then the tangled feelings must be addressed directly.

## The Eight-Step Framework for Helping a Child Who Hits

### 1. Connect with Your Child in Healing Ways

**Daily dedicated time:** Spend half an hour every day being 100% present with the child. Let the child decide what to do with the time. Pour love into them and ignore all distractions.

**Why this works:** The child experiences being the center of attention and knows that making them happy matters that much to the parent. Most importantly, the child sees how much the parent delights in them, which is the foundation of their feeling of self-worth.

**Research backing:** A strong parent-child relationship with each child is one of the most important factors in children getting along with each other.

### 2. Build Safety Through Play and Laughter

**The principle:** Every child needs to giggle every day. A child who hits especially needs to giggle about aggression and fear. Mock aggression games that get the child giggling are very healing and strengthen the connection to the parent.

**How to implement:** Most kids will come up with the games they need naturally. A child might say "Let's play I'm the monster and I'm scaring you!" The parent should ham it up and act mock-terrified.

**If the child does not initiate:** Start a pillow fight and act terrified when they come after you with the pillow. If they giggle, you are on the right track.

**Stuffed animal play:** Initiate a game of stuffed animals where a new baby enters the family. The child is likely to create misadventures befalling the baby, such as the baby being "accidentally" fed to sharks or thrown into the garbage. Do not suggest these "accidents" but do not be shocked by them either.

**Why this works:** Play is nature's harmless way of helping children process their emotions. Anything that gets the child giggling is helping them work through the same emotions that otherwise cause aggression.

### 3. Start a Discussion to Help Put Feelings into Words

**Core principle:** If a child can put feelings into words, they will not have to act them out. However, young children are not practiced at this and are often sure that their angry or jealous feelings are not allowed.

**Acknowledge their experience:** Show them that you know this is difficult for them and that they are trying hard.

**Example phrases:**
- "It must be so hard to wait when you need help with your train tracks, and my hands are busy with the baby."
- "It's hard to be a big sister sometimes. You are working so hard to be patient."

**Books as discussion starters:** Reading books about older siblings and new babies can get the discussion going. Choose books that show all feelings are allowed but do NOT show siblings engaging in unkind behavior (bad role-modeling to avoid).

**When the child hurls the book across the room:** If the child rejects a book about siblings, you have struck a sore place. Acknowledge gently: "You don't like this book! I wonder if sometimes you feel bad inside about OUR baby." Do not analyze whether what they feel is rage or jealousy. They have felt it all. Just acknowledge what you see: "You threw the book; you don't want to read it. It's upsetting to read about this family with the new baby, because sometimes it's upsetting that WE have a new baby."

### 4. When Your Child Hits, Go First to the Sibling Who Is Hurt

**Why this sequence matters:** Parents feel an urgent need to teach the hitter a lesson, but the child who needs immediate attention is the one who is hurt. The hitter is not going anywhere ("you know where he lives").

**What going to the hurt child accomplishes:** Comforting the hurt child moves the parent into a more nurturing place, which is what they need to access when dealing with the hitter.

**Resist the punishment urge:** The desire to punish is just the parent's frustration. What the parent really wants is to stop the hitting, and the only way to do that is to help the child with their feelings. That requires seeing it from the child's perspective rather than seeing them as the enemy.

### 5. Help the Child Get Past Anger to the Tears and Fears Beneath

**Trust that feelings are driving the behavior:** Even if you do not see any sign of a specific emotion, upsetting feelings are driving the child's actions.

**The goal:** Help the child surface the feelings that drove the hitting so they can "show" them to you.

**The mechanism:** Once we feel emotions in the safe presence of a compassionate witness, the emotions begin to evaporate.

**How to approach physically:** Move right in close, get down on the child's level, look them in the eyes (windows to the soul). You may see only a blank expression.

**Parent self-regulation:** Keep breathing and remind yourself that this is a good kid who needs your help, so you can stay kind and calm.

**What to say:** Empathize with simple statements like "That was hard... Your sister was crying... I see you felt bad... Tell me about it."

**Create a safe space:** Say things like "I wonder if it's hard for you sometimes, to have the baby in our family now..."

**When anger emerges:** As you summon compassion and try to see it from their point of view, the child's anger will break through their numbness. They may begin to shout about how much they hate you, or their sister, or their life. **This is good because anger dissolves the numbness.** Tell them it is okay to be angry, that you want to hear more about it. Stay calm, kind, and empathize: "Oh, Sweetie, you feel like I'm mean, and never understand? I'm so sorry. That must hurt so much."

**Minimal words, open heart:** You do not need a lot of words, just your own open heart.

**The progression to tears:** As you really see how much pain your child is in, you will probably have tears in your eyes. This is part of what will move the child into their own tears. **The goal is to create enough safety with empathy that the child can cry, which is what dissolves the anger.**

**Physical manifestations of fear processing:** Once the child breaks through to fear, they may also writhe, struggle, yell, and sweat. This is what happens as fear moves through us. Eventually, the child will be crying in your arms.

### 6. Support the Part of Your Child Doing Brave Battle Inside

**Key insight:** Part of your child does lash out at the younger sibling. But another part would protect the sibling if anyone else threatened them and never wants to hurt them. **Ally with that protective part.**

**How to ally with it:** Notice every positive thing the child does, especially (but not only) in relationship to the sibling, and say what you see.

**Example phrases:**
- "When you showed the baby your toy, he looked so happy."
- "You are patting so gently."
- "The baby always laughs more for you than anyone. He thinks you're wonderful."

### 7. Encourage the Sibling Bond

**Goal:** Strengthen the part of the child that wants to protect the sibling.

**Specific tactics:**
- Play games where the two children team up against the parent
- Make a book with photos of them having fun together and read it regularly
- Encourage them to make drawings for each other
- Help each child make or buy small presents for the other, even if the baby does not really understand
- Let the older child be important in the baby's life by helping in ways that make them happy: "It sounds like your baby woke up; let's go get her."

**Reduce rivalry through language:** Say "As soon as my hands are free, I want to help you with that" rather than "I'm busy with your sister right now, I will help you next."

**The pheromone technique:** Sit the older child on the couch next to you and put the baby in their lap. Teach them how to "smell" the top of the baby's head. Some researchers believe that pheromones given off by the top of a baby's head disable our aggressive impulses (an evolutionary adaptation that made it more likely for babies to survive and pass on their genes). The more often the older child inhales the baby's pheromones, the more protective they will be.

### 8. Prevention as Parental Responsibility

**Core principle:** It is the parent's responsibility to keep children safe. A parent might think they should be able to leave a nine-month-old alone with a four-year-old, but if the four-year-old is hitting, they cannot. Wishing things were different is a disservice to both children.

**Stop resenting the supervision requirement:** Accept it as reality and adjust expectations accordingly.

**Reframe when something happens:** Train yourself to say "OUCH! I am so sorry I wasn't here to keep everyone safe" rather than blaming the child exclusively.

**Proactive supervision:** When the older child pets the baby, move in close. Smile and say "I am right here, Sweetie. I will help you be gentle."

**Watch for warning signs:** When you notice the older child getting cranky, cuddle with them in their chill-out-nook to help them refuel, or encourage them to spend some replenishing quiet time there.

**Share responsibility for incidents:** If the older child does hurt the baby, take your share of the responsibility for not being there to help with feelings and prevent it. This will make the child less defensive, so it is easier for them to take their share of the responsibility.

## The Underlying Psychology Explained

### The Internal War

The child experiences a war between their affection for the sibling and the monstrous feelings (jealousy, fear, grief, sense of displacement). They will pat the baby gently and coo, then suddenly find themselves gripped with desire to harm. As one four-year-old said about his baby sister: "I hate her. I don't know why. I just do." (Note: That same pair grew up to be young adults who adore each other, demonstrating positive prognosis is possible.)

### The Empathy Erosion Cycle

Every time the child chooses to push the sibling down instead of pat gently, they deaden their empathy. Every time a parent responds with anger, the child's heart hardens more. Eventually, only a mask of numbness remains, the blank expression of a fortress.

### The Numbing-Aggression Connection

The child feels overwhelming emotions (fear of inadequacy compared to the baby, grief of lost special status). These feelings are so upsetting the child cannot bear them. When feelings start to swamp the child, they lash out to avoid feeling them. The blank expression shows they are trying to numb themselves.

### Why Parents Also Struggle

Most adults never learned to manage their own feelings except through numbing using "little addictions" like food or screen time, because they did not get emotional support in childhood. When their child cries or rages, it pushes all their buttons. Unbearable feelings swamp the parent too, and like the child lashing out when overwhelmed, the parent also lashes out to avoid their own feelings.

## The Long View

The child did not ask for a sibling. The parent chose to bring another child into the family. By helping the child with complicated feelings about the sibling, the parent helps the child work through jealousy and fear to reclaim empathy, so they begin to care when the sibling hurts.

By creating a safe space for the child to clear out painful emotions, the parent gives love a chance to grow. This lays the foundation for the children's relationship with each other for the rest of their lives.

## Key Warnings and Anti-Patterns

**Do not:**
- Interpret the blank expression as enjoyment or deliberate cruelty
- Punish the child for hitting (it hardens their heart and increases numbness)
- Expect "attention" alone to solve the problem
- Leave the children unsupervised when the older child has been hitting
- Say "I'm busy with your sister right now" (increases rivalry)
- Read books that show siblings being unkind to each other (bad role-modeling)
- Suggest the "accidents" in stuffed animal play (let the child lead)
- Respond to hitting by immediately lecturing the hitter
- Be shocked by the child's aggressive fantasies in play
- Think the child should be able to "make better choices" without emotional support

**Do:**
- Go to the hurt child first when hitting occurs
- Create safety for the hitter to surface feelings after comforting the hurt child
- Accept the need for supervision without resentment
- Take your share of responsibility for not preventing incidents
- Welcome anger as progress (it breaks through numbness toward tears)
- Let the child smell the baby's head to activate protective instincts
- Acknowledge all feelings, including hatred and jealousy, as allowed
