## Why Babies Bite: Understanding the Root Causes

Babies and toddlers bite for many different reasons, and understanding the cause is essential for choosing the right response. The reasons include:

**Developmental communication limitation**: Most babies and toddlers experiment with biting because they cannot express themselves with words yet. Anger and frustration that cannot be verbalized often come out as biting.

**Seeking distance**: Some children bite when overwhelmed with too much closeness and want space. The bite functions as a way to create physical separation.

**Exploratory biting**: Some babies bite in an exploratory way, for instance while nursing or snuggling. They are learning about their world through their mouths.

**Teething and sensory pleasure**: Many little ones bite when teething or excited simply because it feels good. The physical sensation of biting provides relief or satisfaction.

**Strong oral need**: Some babies seem to have a particularly strong need to bite as their way of experiencing the world. This is temperamental and not about misbehavior.

**Expression of affection**: Strangely enough, many babies this age bite as an expression of love. Their love is so big they want to take a bite out of you, like the feeling of "I love you so much I could eat you up!"

## The Core Problem: Babies Don't Understand They're Causing Pain

A critical insight is that young children don't actually understand that biting hurts you. This explains several puzzling behaviors:

When you say "No," the baby laughs and bites again because she thinks it's a game. The word "no" by itself doesn't communicate pain.

When you say no louder, she cries because she sees you're angry, but she still doesn't understand why you're angry. The connection between her action and your pain isn't clear to her.

Even once a child figures out you're mad because she bit you, she may see it as a dare and keep doing it. Anger without demonstrated pain becomes a challenge.

**Only once a child understands that you HURT when she bites is she likely to stop.** This is the key realization that informs the entire approach.

## Why Common Approaches Fail

The biting phase often gets prolonged for one of two reasons:

1. **The parent is not forceful enough**: A calm "no" doesn't communicate the severity of the situation or the pain being caused.

2. **The parent engages in a struggle with the child**: Power struggles turn biting into a contest of wills rather than a learning moment about causing pain.

## The Eight-Step Framework for Stopping Biting

### Step 1: Recognize Feelings and Give Words Before the Bite Happens

**When to use**: As soon as you get the sense she might be about to bite.

**Technique**: Hold her away from you and say "You want to Bite. No biting! Are you MAD? Say MAD!"

**Why this works**: Research suggests that simply acknowledging the feelings of pre-verbal children in this way can prevent biting and even end tantrums. You're giving the child language for what she's experiencing internally, which provides an alternative outlet to physical action.

**Key principle**: Intervene before the bite, not after, when you can see it coming.

### Step 2: Provide a Substitute for Biting

**The redirect approach**: When you sense she's about to bite, always hand her a teether and say "Teethers are for biting. People aren't for biting. Show me how you bite the teether."

**Why this works**: Some kids simply have a need to bite, and redirecting the biting is far more effective than trying to stop it entirely. The goal isn't to eliminate biting altogether but to ensure she never bites people.

**Practical implementation**: Attach a tough teether to a pacifier leash so it stays accessible (not around her neck). Whenever she seems about to bite, put the teething ring to her mouth.

**Case example**: One mother started giving her daughter teriyaki jerky to chew when she seemed in a biting mood. The daughter completely stopped biting people. The sensory need was satisfied through an acceptable alternative.

**Important distinction**: She may not be mad at all - she may be nipping out of excitement. Regardless of the emotion driving it, the substitute approach applies.

### Step 3: Identify and Manage High-Risk Situations

**Observation**: Most kids bite only in certain kinds of situations. These patterns exist.

**Strategy**: Stay especially alert during those situations when your child is most likely to bite. When you're vigilant in high-risk moments, you can usually keep your skin out of her way and get the teether in her mouth before she bites.

**Proactive prevention**: Use the reminder phrase "Teethers are for biting, never people" during these moments.

### Step 4: Physical Response When Bitten - Push In, Don't Pull Away

**Counter-intuitive technique**: Don't pull away when she bites you because pulling away increases bruising and can cut into the skin.

**What to do instead**: Push into her mouth. She will open it and let go, and you are less likely to be cut or bruised.

**Why this works**: The push-in motion naturally triggers the baby to open her mouth. Pulling away drags teeth across skin.

### Step 5: Show Unequivocally That Biting HURTS

**Immediate physical response**: If you are holding her, put her down immediately.

**Emotional demonstration**: Start crying dramatically. Cry and sob loudly.

**Why crying works**: She knows what crying is. Even small babies are upset by others crying because they know it signifies pain and unhappiness.

**Verbal component**: Say "OUCH, BITING HURTS!" loudly as you sob.

**Why this approach differs from conventional advice**: Many experts suggest not rewarding "bad" behavior by giving the child attention for it. However, when a little one acts aggressively toward us, they are testing us. Ignoring biting or acting calm is a mistake.

**The deeper purpose**: We want to give the child the message that she is hurting us and hurting our relationship. Children look to us to show them how relationships work.

**Why dramatic reaction succeeds**: Kids are often actually shocked when they learn that their biting hurts. This honest, dramatic reaction communicates the truth in a way the child can understand.

### What NOT To Do (Anti-Patterns)

The following responses are explicitly discouraged:

- **Don't get mad at them**: Anger without demonstrated pain becomes a power struggle or a dare.
- **Don't yell**: Yelling expresses anger, not pain.
- **Don't punish them**: Punishment doesn't teach the connection between biting and causing hurt.
- **Don't make them bite soap**: This is punitive and doesn't address the learning need.
- **Don't put them in timeout**: Isolation doesn't communicate the message about pain and relationship.
- **Don't bite them back**: This models the exact behavior you want to stop.
- **Even a stern "No Biting" will often be perceived as a dare**: The firmness without emotional honesty triggers defiance rather than understanding.

### Step 6: Prevent the Interaction from Becoming a Game, Dare, or Power Struggle

**Sequence after biting occurs**:
1. Put her down
2. Completely ignore her
3. Focus on where you were bitten
4. Cry loudly as if you are in pain
5. Keep ignoring her for a minute - you want her to take this seriously

**Critical warning - do NOT leave the room**: Walking out of the room triggers the baby's abandonment panic so forcefully that she forgets all about the biting lesson. The panic overwrites the learning. Additionally, it traumatizes her.

**What happens during this minute**: Your alarm and crying may upset your child to the point of tears. This is appropriate - she needs to feel the weight of what happened.

**After the minute of ignoring**: If she is crying, pick her up and comfort her. Say: "It's ok, Mommy is ok now, but biting hurts. You hurt Mommy. We never bite. We HUG? Ok?" Then give her a big hug.

**Why this sequence works**: The temporary withdrawal of attention (without abandonment) communicates relationship damage. The comfort afterward models repair and gives words to what happened. The hug provides an alternative expression of physical connection.

### Step 7: Manage Social and Media Influences

**Avoid reinforcement from other biters**: If your child is ever around another child who bites, keep them apart for a while. Biters tend to reinforce each other.

**Monitor media exposure**: If you notice any biting scenes in anything she watches (for example, there is a biter in the movie Madagascar), stop watching those shows. She's learning from everything she sees.

**Principle**: Children model behavior they observe, whether from peers or media.

### Step 8: Use Books About Biting

**Resource recommendation**: Find books that deal with biting to read to your child. These reinforce the message through story and give language to the issue.

**Format note**: Look for board book versions for young children.

## Reassurance About Timeline

As kids gain words and impulse control, even the most dedicated biters do stop biting other people. Language development provides alternative expression, and impulse control development provides the ability to stop the urge before acting on it.

The strategies above are designed to help children stop biting immediately rather than waiting for natural developmental progression.

## Summary of Core Principles

1. **Understand the cause** to choose the right response - biting has many different roots.

2. **Pain communication is the key** - children stop when they understand they're causing hurt, not when they understand you're angry.

3. **Substitute rather than suppress** - redirect the biting need to appropriate objects.

4. **Prevent rather than punish** - intervene before bites happen in predictable situations.

5. **Honest emotional response** - demonstrate pain dramatically and authentically.

6. **Avoid power struggles** - don't engage in ways that turn biting into a game or dare.

7. **Maintain connection** - show relationship damage without abandonment, then repair with comfort and hugs.

8. **Control environmental influences** - manage exposure to biting behavior in peers and media.
