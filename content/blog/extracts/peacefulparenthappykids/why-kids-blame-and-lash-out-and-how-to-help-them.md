# Why Kids Blame and Lash Out and How To Help Them

## The Core Mechanism: Fight, Flight, or Freeze Response

When children experience distress, whether physical pain or emotional hurt, they automatically enter the mammalian **fight, flight, or freeze** response. This is not a conscious choice but an instant, automatic physiological reaction that all mammals share.

When a child steps on a toy and experiences pain, or when something happens that hurts her feelings, she is plunged into distress. The "fight" response manifests as lashing out at whoever is closest or throwing objects. She might blame a parent for distracting her or a sibling for simply being nearby.

**Critical insight**: When children lash out, it is not because they want to make others feel as bad as they do. In that moment, they are not even considering others. When in fight, flight, or freeze mode, children cannot think straight or access their empathy. The lashing out happens because they cannot bear their own feelings of hurt, fear, and sadness. To fend off these unbearable feelings, they get angry. The best defense in that moment seems like a good offense.

## Why Anger Emerges as the Primary Response

Anger serves as a protective mechanism against more vulnerable emotions. When children feel fear, disappointment, or sadness, anger provides a way to avoid sitting with those painful feelings. By picking a fight or blaming someone else, the child is essentially dumping the pain elsewhere so she does not have to feel it directly.

This is not unique to children. Adults demonstrate the same pattern:
- We almost run a red light and yell at our kids for distracting us
- We get a parking ticket and blame our partner for taking too long in the store
- Someone we love dies and we get angry at the doctor

The difference is that adults have more ability to self-regulate because the **prefrontal cortex** is fully developed. Adults can notice the impulse to blame and bite their tongue before going on the attack. If adults can let themselves feel the distress but resist the urge to act on it, those unhappy emotions will move through and dissipate. Once calm, adults often see that the impulse to blame was not fair.

Children's prefrontal cortex is still developing, which limits their capacity for this kind of self-regulation. This is why they need external support to learn these skills.

## Six Strategies to Help Children Move Beyond Blame

### 1. Stay Calm

The child feels like the situation is an emergency. Your calm attitude communicates that there is no emergency, which signals to the child that she does not need to remain in "fight" mode. Your regulated state helps regulate her dysregulated state.

### 2. Empathize

Whether the hurt is physical or emotional, the child is in pain. Acknowledging this pain helps her feel:
- Understood
- Less alone
- Less like the situation is an emergency

The key technique is to **bypass the anger and respond to the hurt or fear that is driving the anger**. This approach also helps the child understand her own emotions better.

Example response: "Sweetie, that must hurt! Ouch!"

### 3. Do Not Attack Back

When children attack, they are doing so to avoid their own pain. If they can pick a fight, it provides a way to dump the pain elsewhere. The parent should not take the bait.

When the child says "It's your fault!" respond with: "You are pretty upset... That must really hurt."

When the child is attacking a sibling, you can acknowledge the displacement while redirecting to the actual issue: "Right now it seems like it's everyone else's fault, doesn't it? Your foot must really hurt. Let's help your foot, instead of blaming your brother. What can we do to help your poor foot?"

This approach validates the emotional experience while gently redirecting away from blame and toward problem-solving.

### 4. Model Taking Responsibility

The goal is to help the child assume her share of responsibility instead of blaming someone else. The parent models this by taking responsibility in whatever small amount is appropriate.

When the child says "It's all your fault!" respond with: "You wish that toy hadn't been there. Me too! That really hurt your poor foot. I so wish I could have seen this coming and gotten that toy out of there. I'm so sorry you got hurt."

**Important distinction**: This is not about blaming yourself. It is about helping the child not blame herself or anyone else. The healing process in children is facilitated when adults step into the story and model taking responsibility. This approach is the opposite of victimization, where someone is always at fault and someone is always a victim.

### 5. Teach Repair

This step happens **later, when the child is no longer hurting**. Timing is critical because the child cannot process this kind of teaching while still in distress.

Example approach: "That really hurt your foot... No wonder you were so upset... And when you told your brother that it was all his fault, I think that hurt his feelings. I know it's his toy, but he loves you and would never want to hurt you. I wonder how you can make things better with your brother now?"

This conversation:
- Validates the original hurt
- Connects the child's behavior to its impact on others
- Affirms the sibling relationship
- Opens a collaborative exploration of repair rather than demanding a specific action

### 6. Create a No-Blame Household

**Key finding**: When children grow up in households where blame is a way of life, they become more defensive and more inclined to blame rather than take responsibility.

Conversely, families who focus on solutions instead of blame raise children who are more able to take responsibility. The reason is that in solution-focused families, admitting a mistake does not mean the child is "wrong" or "bad." This removes the defensive need to deflect blame.

**Practical implementation**: Every time you start to assign blame, teach yourself to ask "What can we do to solve this?" instead. This reframes situations from finding fault to finding solutions, which models the exact skill you want children to develop.

## Summary of the Emotional Sequence

1. Child experiences distress (physical or emotional pain)
2. Fight, flight, or freeze response is triggered automatically
3. Child cannot think straight or access empathy in this state
4. Anger emerges as a protective mechanism against vulnerable feelings
5. Child lashes out or blames others to dump the pain elsewhere
6. Parent stays calm, empathizes with underlying hurt, does not attack back
7. Parent models taking responsibility without assigning blame
8. Later, when child is calm, parent teaches repair
9. Over time, solution-focused household culture reduces defensive blaming patterns
