## Core Principle: Parental Influence is Decisive

Parents are the most important influence on whether kids drink alcohol. This is not a peripheral factor but the central one. Kids whose parents actively teach them about the risks of drugs and alcohol are **half as likely to use them**. This establishes why all the strategies below matter: they work because parental engagement directly shapes outcomes.

**Current context on teen drinking:** About 60% of teenagers across all ages report they don't drink, which represents a decline from previous generations. However, some of these teens are substituting marijuana for alcohol rather than avoiding substances entirely. This means conversations need to address both alcohol and marijuana, especially as recreational marijuana becomes legal in many places. The legality shift for adults makes the "why not for teens" conversation more important, not less.

## Timing: Start Early and Revisit Often

**Don't wait until the teen years.** The common instinct to delay these conversations until kids are approaching temptation age is counterproductive. Early conversations (starting as young as age 7) build foundational understanding before peer pressure begins.

**Why revisit over time:** Children reach new levels of understanding and face new levels of temptation at different developmental stages. A conversation that worked at age 9 needs updating at age 13 and again at age 16. This isn't repetition for its own sake - it's matching the conversation to the child's cognitive level and social context.

**Natural conversation triggers:** Use relevant events as entry points rather than forcing awkward "talks." When there's an accident in your community involving alcohol, discuss it even with a 9-year-old. Example framing: "This was a tragedy that could so easily have been avoided... alcohol is not for high school students... their bodies and brains are not ready to handle it yet. That's why it's against the law for kids to drink alcohol."

## The Brain Development Argument: Why Kids Must Wait

This is the most important factual foundation because it explains WHY the rules exist, not just that they exist.

**For adults who drink or use drugs moderately, the brain changes are temporary.** The substances alter thinking and reaction time, but the brain returns to normal after the substance clears.

**For kids and teens, the brain is still developing, so the effects are long-lasting and structural.** Alcohol and drugs don't just temporarily impair a developing brain - they actually change how the brain develops. This creates permanent alterations rather than temporary ones.

**The addiction connection:** Kids who try alcohol before age 15 are **four times more likely to develop alcoholism** than those who begin after age 20. This isn't just correlation - early use while the brain is developing creates vulnerability that persists into adulthood.

**Cannabis and dopamine:** Cannabis changes the dopamine circuitry in the developing brain. This makes the person more likely to feel depressed and more stressed by normal daily life unless they are high. Because this happens during brain development, these changes become long-term rather than temporary.

**Answering the "but adults do it too" objection:** When an 11-year-old points out that adults get in accidents too, acknowledge they're right that no one should drink/use and drive. Then explain the key distinction: adults who use moderately recover fully, while young people's brains are permanently altered. Also: early use makes it harder to handle drinking responsibly as an adult. The restriction isn't arbitrary - it's protective during a specific developmental window.

## Age-Appropriate Expectation Setting

Different ages require different framings, but the core message stays consistent.

**For a 7-year-old:** Keep it simple and binary. "When is it okay to drink alcohol? That's right, when you're a grown-up!" At this age, the goal is establishing a clear category: alcohol belongs in adulthood.

**For an 11-year-old:** Acknowledge curiosity as normal while maintaining the boundary. "It's my job to help you stay healthy. I know that lots of kids around you will try alcohol or drugs and you'll naturally be curious about it. You can always tell me and ask me anything you want, and we can brainstorm about what you can say to your friends, but I don't want you drinking or using drugs. It's bad for you in so many ways." Key elements: normalizing curiosity, keeping communication open, establishing clear expectation, inviting collaboration on peer situations.

**For a 15-year-old:** Frame it as current protection while respecting future autonomy. "When you are a grown-up, whether you drink or try marijuana is up to you. Right now, though, it is up to me to help you protect yourself. Drinking alcohol and using marijuana are against the law for minors, and it's dangerous for you. I want you to take care of yourself so you have the best life possible now and in the future." This respects the teen's growing sense of independence while making clear the current rules and reasoning.

**On marijuana legalization (all ages):** Address the changing legal landscape directly. "I know that marijuana is being decriminalized, and even legalized in many states, but not for young people. That's because your brain is still growing, and any psychoactive substance affects the way your brain develops. When you're an adult, you can make your own decisions about marijuana, but I expect you to say No to it until you're of age." The key distinction: legal for adults doesn't mean safe for developing brains.

## Complete List of Facts to Share Early

Give kids these facts before you think they need them, so they have ammunition when peer pressure arrives.

1. **Brain development impact:** Because your brain is still developing, using alcohol or marijuana actually changes the way your brain works and makes it less smart, and less happy - for the rest of your life.

2. **Addiction statistics:** Kids who try alcohol before age 15 are four times more likely to develop alcoholism than those who begin after age 20.

3. **Cannabis and mood:** Cannabis changes the dopamine circuitry in your brain, making you more likely to feel depressed and more stressed by normal daily life, unless you are high. Because this is happening while your brain is developing, it changes your brain not just for the moment, but long-term.

4. **Decision-making impairment:** Being a teenager is hard, and making good choices requires all your best thinking. Teens can't think as well when they drink or are high, so you're more likely to do things you'll be sorry about later.

5. **Physical health:** It's bad for your body. (For kids who play sports, this can be especially convincing because athletic performance matters to them.)

6. **Legal consequences:** It's against the law.

## Keeping Communication Open

**Kids test you before trusting you.** They'll share smaller things to see how you react before revealing bigger concerns. If you over-react to small disclosures, they won't share the big ones.

**Example of a test disclosure:** "Oliver snuck vodka into school today in a Starbucks cup."

**What NOT to say:** "That's terrible! I hope he got in big trouble!" - This shuts down the conversation because it signals you'll react with judgment rather than curiosity.

**What TO do:** Take a deep breath, stay calm, and ask questions that get your child talking and thinking.

**Questions that open rather than close conversation:**
- "Wow! How could you tell he was drinking?"
- "What did the other kids do?"
- "Did other kids try it?"
- "How did they act?"
- "What did you think?"
- "Did you want to try it?"
- "Why or why not?"
- "Why do you think Oliver did that?"
- "What ended up happening?"
- "Do you think other kids will try this now?"
- "Would you ever do something like that?"
- "Why or why not?"
- "Did any of the kids handle this incident in a way you admired?"

The progression of these questions moves from factual (what happened) to reflective (what did you think) to values-based (what would you do, what do you admire). This guides the child to think through the situation rather than just receive a lecture.

## Coaching Over Controlling

**The fundamental limitation:** You cannot actually control your child when they're out of your sight. Attempting to do so is both impossible and counterproductive.

**What you CAN do:** Help them become a person who has good values and good judgment. You accomplish this through modeling and through talking. The goal is internal compass, not external compliance.

**Method: Ask questions that prompt reflection.** Rather than telling kids what to think, ask questions that help them discover what matters to them and who they want to be. Then listen carefully - their answers reveal their thinking.

**Reflection-prompting questions:**
- Why do you think it's illegal for kids and teens to drink alcohol?
- What would you do if you were in a car and the driver had been drinking?
- What about if the driver was a grown-up, like the parent of a friend?
- Do you know any adults who drink too much? What do you think of them?
- Have you ever thought that I drank too much? Acted differently when I drank alcohol?
- Do you know any kids who have tried alcohol or drugs? Do you think that's a problem?
- Why do you think kids try alcohol or drugs?
- When do you think kids are ready to try alcohol or marijuana?
- What do the kids at your school do at parties? Have you been to a party like that?
- Have you ever been offered a drink or try marijuana? How did you handle it? Were you tempted? Why or why not?
- What could you say if you were offered a drink or an edible and you didn't want to look foolish?
- What could you do at a party if you were feeling a little nervous, besides drinking?
- What would you do if you were at a party and someone passed out from drinking alcohol?
- Have you ever heard of rohypnol pills, often called "roofies"? This is a prescription-only sedative that has been used in many date rapes because it incapacitates the victim. How would you protect yourself against someone putting a roofie in your drink?
- Would you be worried about becoming addicted to alcohol or drugs? Why or why not?

## Practice Conversations: Rehearsing Refusal

**Why practice matters:** Having pre-planned responses reduces the in-the-moment pressure to come up with something. The child has already rehearsed what to say.

**Walk through various scenarios:** Discuss different situations they might encounter and the decisions they might have to make. What might they do or say?

**Sample responses to "Want a drink?":**
- "No, thanks, I'm the designated driver."
- "No, thanks, I want to keep a clear head tonight."
- "No, thanks, I don't drink."
- "No, thanks, my playing on the team is too important to me."
- "No, thanks, I'm allergic to alcohol."
- "No thanks, I love my cokes plain."
- "No thanks, I take medication that interacts with alcohol in a dangerous way."
- "No, thanks. My parents would ground me forever if they found out - and they always do!"

Each of these gives a different "out" depending on what feels most comfortable or believable for the specific child and situation. Some use humor, some use authority figures as the excuse, some assert personal values directly.

## Practical Strategies for Staying a Non-Drinker

Alcohol is present at many teen gatherings, just as it is at adult gatherings. Acknowledging this reality and brainstorming strategies helps teens navigate it rather than pretending the situation won't arise.

**Build a social network of non-drinkers:** Cultivate a group of other non-drinkers who enjoy doing things you enjoy, like board games, cooking, or crafts. This provides social belonging without substance pressure.

**Make your home the gathering place:** Ask your parents to help you make your home the gathering place of choice for non-alcoholic events. This puts the teen in control of the environment.

**Use the buddy system:** Find another non-drinking teen to go with you to any party where there is alcohol, for mutual support. Having an ally reduces isolation and provides someone to leave with.

**Bring your own drink:** At parties where there is alcohol, bring a favorite non-alcoholic drink to sip on. This gives you something in your hands and an automatic response to offers.

**Have an exit plan:** When you go to a party where there is alcohol, have an alternative plan in case the drinking starts to get out of hand. For instance, agree in advance with a friend that you'll leave early and go to your house for popcorn and a movie, unless you're both loving being there. Pre-planning the exit removes the awkwardness of deciding in the moment.

## Providing Alternative Sources of Excitement

**Why teens seek risk:** Teens need excitement and need to test themselves in new situations that involve excitement and risk. This is developmental and normal, not a problem to eliminate.

**The danger of unmet needs:** If teens don't have legitimate outlets for excitement and risk-taking, they may fill that need with alcohol and drugs.

**Alternative excitement sources:** Encourage physical activities like skateboarding or rock climbing, or passions like acting. These provide the thrill and self-testing teens need without the dangers of substance use.

---

## Raising a Child Who Can Say No

**The obedience trap:** When kids are raised to obey authority without question, they sometimes can't assert themselves when other teens act like authorities. The habit of compliance transfers to peer pressure situations.

**The solution:** When your child says no to you, listen. When possible, try to find win-win solutions. This develops a young person who WANTS to cooperate with you AND who follows their own moral compass.

**The key distinction (memorable quote):** "Obedience is doing what you're told no matter what's right. Morality is doing what's right no matter what you're told."

**Practical implication:** When you wish your child would just obey without asserting their side of things, remember that the same assertiveness you find frustrating is what will protect them from peer pressure.

## When Your Child Does Try Alcohol

**The realistic expectation:** Like it or not, most kids will try alcohol before they're 21. This is statistically true regardless of parenting quality.

**Dual goals:** Postpone that day as long as possible AND keep good communication with your child so that when they do start drinking, you know about it. The second goal is why you can't sacrifice communication for control.

**Why knowing matters:** When you know they're drinking, you can help them think through how to keep themselves safe. If they hide it, they face the dangers alone.

**Safety conversation when drinking begins:** "I hear that you're curious and want to try drinking. But you don't know how your body will react. What would you do to be sure you're safe? How would you be sure that you have a friend with you who isn't drinking, who you can count on? How would you be sure you can take care of yourself if some guy you're not interested in gets forceful? How would you get home?"

These questions shift from "don't drink" (which they're doing anyway) to "how will you stay safe while drinking" - harm reduction that maintains influence.

## The Emergency Pickup System

**Setup:** Establish a signal that your child can text to you - a code word or a specific emoji - that means only one thing: "Come get me!" This is agreed upon in advance and used for nothing else.

**The parent's role:** As soon as your child texts that signal, immediately text back that there is a family emergency and you are coming to pick up your child. This creates cover.

**Why the cover story matters:** The teen can tell friends that their mean parents are making them come home for some family emergency. This saves face with peers while getting the teen out of a dangerous situation.

**The Monday morning question:** Parents often worry about what happens when friends ask "What was the emergency?" In practice, they rarely ask. If the teen needs an explanation, they can simply say, "You know my mom. Everything is an emergency."

**The no-punishment promise:** "Never hesitate to call me if you're in trouble or one of your friends is in trouble. I will be there if you need me, no matter what, and no punishment." This removes the barrier of "I'll get in trouble if I call." Don't let a momentary lapse become a tragedy by making help feel unavailable.

## Modeling Healthy Behavior

**Research finding:** Kids are influenced by their parents' drinking. If you drink heavily, your child is more likely to start drinking earlier and to drink more heavily. The pattern transmits across generations through observation.

**Practical implication:** Model a responsible relationship with alcohol. What you do matters as much as what you say.

**Beyond alcohol:** Model handling your own emotions responsibly. This gives kids the foundation they need to manage their own emotions so they don't self-medicate with substances. The underlying skill is emotional regulation; alcohol problems are often emotional regulation problems.

---

## Building Emotional Intelligence

**The self-medication pattern:** Drinking is one way that teens "self-medicate" when they don't have healthier ways to process their feelings. If they lack emotional skills, substances become coping mechanisms.

**What to develop:** Help your child learn to notice their own moods and work through feelings in a healthy way. Help them find positive ways to deal with stress.

**Why this prevents substance use:** When teens have functional emotional regulation skills, they don't need alcohol or drugs to manage difficult feelings. The substances become unnecessary rather than tempting.

---

## The Foundation: Stay Connected

**Above all, stay connected with your child at every age.**

**Why connection is foundational:** Every bit of influence you have with your child derives from your relationship. Without connection, all the advice and strategies above become ineffective. The relationship IS the influence channel.
