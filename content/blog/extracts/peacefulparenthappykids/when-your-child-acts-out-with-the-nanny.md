# When Your Child Acts Out With The Nanny

## Why Children Misbehave With Caregivers

Children act out with nannies for three distinct reasons, each requiring a different intervention:

**Lack of emotional connection**: The child does not feel bonded to the nanny. Without that emotional closeness, the child has no internal motivation to cooperate. Connection is the foundation of cooperation - children want to please people they feel close to.

**Ineffective limit-setting by the nanny**: The nanny may struggle to set clear, consistent boundaries. If limits are wobbly or inconsistently enforced, children will push against them because they sense the boundary can be moved.

**Authority perception problem**: The child does not recognize the nanny's authority as legitimate. From the child's perspective, obeying the nanny feels optional because "the nanny is not you" (the parent). The child may think that following rules only matters when the parent is present.

## Three-Part Solution Framework

The solution requires addressing all three potential root causes simultaneously rather than focusing on just one.

### 1. Build the Relationship Between Child and Nanny

Parents should actively facilitate closeness between the nanny and child. This is not something that happens automatically - parents need to create opportunities for bonding. The emotional connection must be built up because cooperation flows from relationship. A child who feels connected to the nanny will naturally want to cooperate more.

### 2. Coach the Nanny on Effective Limit-Setting

The nanny needs to learn how to set boundaries that are firm without being harsh. The key concept is that the nanny should **"be like a wall - not movable."** When the child pushes against a limit, the nanny does not budge. This consistency teaches the child that pushing is futile.

However, firmness does not require punishment or meanness. There is no reason to be punitive or harsh when setting limits. Children actually respond better to calm, firm boundaries than to angry or punitive ones. The goal is to be immovable in the limit while remaining warm in the relationship.

### 3. Establish Explicit Parental Backup

Parents must clearly communicate to the child that they back up the nanny's authority. The parent should tell the child directly: "I expect you to do what the nanny asks." This message establishes that nanny rules have parental weight behind them.

If the child believes something is unfair, the parent can offer a channel for discussion: "If you think something is unfair, you can talk to me about it later." This provides an appropriate outlet for grievances while maintaining the expectation of compliance in the moment. The child knows they have recourse without being allowed to ignore the nanny's authority in real-time.

## Key Principles

**Connection before compliance**: Building relationship is listed first because it creates the foundation. A child who feels emotionally connected to the caregiver has intrinsic motivation to cooperate.

**Firmness without harshness**: These are separate qualities. A limit can be absolutely immovable while the person enforcing it remains kind and calm. Punitive approaches are unnecessary and counterproductive.

**Unified authority structure**: The child needs to understand that the nanny's authority is an extension of parental authority, not a separate (and therefore ignorable) system. Parental backup is what gives the nanny's rules weight in the child's mind.

**Delayed discussion channel**: Children can have their concerns heard, but the time for that discussion is later, not in the moment of the limit. This prevents rule-lawyering in real-time while still respecting the child's perspective.
