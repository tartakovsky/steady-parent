# Healing Yourself to Become a More Peaceful Parent

## Core Premise: Unhealed Childhood Wounds Create Parenting Problems

The central argument is that **virtually all of us were wounded as children, and if we don't heal those wounds, they prevent us from parenting our children optimally**. This isn't about obviously abusive situations - it affects even devoted, loving parents who would sacrifice everything for their children.

The mechanism: While we would never consciously hurt our child, much of parenting happens outside our conscious awareness. The areas where you were scarred as a child will reliably cause you grief as a parent and wound your child in turn.

**Dan Siegel's framing**: "In the absence of reflection, history often repeats itself... Research has clearly demonstrated that our children's attachment to us will be influenced by what happened to us when we were young if we do not come to process and understand those experiences."

## The "Good Enough Parent" Concept and Why It's Harder Than It Sounds

**D.W. Winnicott's standard**: Children don't need perfection from their parents. All we need to do is avoid harming them and offer "ordinary devotion."

However, this is misleading in two ways:

**First, there is nothing ordinary about devotion.** Examples of what devotion actually requires:
- Walking the floor at 2am holding a screaming baby with an ear infection
- Turning off your screens to play a board game with your kids
- Forcing yourself into the kitchen to make dinner after a long day when you want to curl up on the couch
- Taking off your jacket on a cold night to tuck it around a sleeping child in the back seat

This "ordinary devotion" is the same intense love that has caused parents throughout human history to hurl themselves between their child and danger - from flying glass to snarling wolves to enemy soldiers.

**Second, even devoted parents often inadvertently scar their children.** The problem isn't lack of love or willingness to sacrifice - it's unconscious patterns from our own childhood.

## Concrete Examples of How Unhealed Wounds Manifest

These examples show how unconscious patterns - not conscious choices - create harm:

- **The judgmental father**: Unwittingly repeats his father's judgmental parenting with his own sons. He would never choose to be judgmental if asked directly, but the pattern runs automatically.

- **The mother who can't set limits**: She can't bear her children's anger at her, so she fails to set appropriate boundaries. The result is anxious, self-centered kids. Her wound (likely around rejection or not being loved) prevents her from doing what's clearly needed.

- **Parents who over-work and delegate to nannies**: They leave babies in others' care not because of financial necessity but because they doubt their own ability to be interested in (translate: to love) their infants. The wound is about their own sense of being unlovable or incapable of connection.

## The Healing Opportunity: Children as Teachers

**The good news is that being parents gives us an opportunity to heal ourselves.** Most parents report that loving their children has transformed them: made them more patient, more compassionate, more selfless. Loving our children helps heal those unloved places inside.

**Children have an unerring ability to show us our wounded places.** Better than the best zen master or therapist, our children draw out our unreasonable fears and angers. Being parents gives us the perfect opportunity to grow and heal.

Most of us run from this hard inner work. But what better motivation than our love for our children?

**The transformation process**: Almost magically, as our wounds transform, we find that these hurt places inform us, motivate us, make us better parents. And happier people. The very things that were problems become sources of wisdom and motivation.

## Six Strategies for Self-Healing

### 1. Get Curious

**The principle**: When we pay attention, we notice where we're over-reacting. And truthfully, most of it is our own stuff.

**Why "most of it" is your stuff**: Not that kids don't act like kids - they always do, and that's age appropriate. But we know that what triggers some parents would be greeted by others with a calm, warm attitude that helps kids WANT to behave. This variation between parents tells us these are individual issues, not universal reactions to child behavior.

**The key insight**: Whenever you get "triggered," you've stumbled on something that needs healing. Your child knows how to push your buttons, but those buttons come from your own childhood. The trigger is the diagnostic tool - it reveals exactly where your healing work needs to happen.

### 2. Break the Cycle Using Your Inner Pause Button

**You don't have to repeat history with your kids.** Even if you're already well down the wrong path, STOP. Take a deep breath and hit the pause button.

**The pause technique**:
- Remind yourself of what is about to happen unless you choose another course
- Walk out of the room
- Don't be embarrassed - you're modeling good anger management
- It's when you have a tantrum that you should be embarrassed

**The reframe on "walking away"**: Leaving the situation isn't failure or weakness. It's demonstrating to your child what healthy emotional regulation looks like. The embarrassment belongs with losing control, not with taking space.

### 3. Understand How Emotions Work

**Anger is a biological state.** When we are in the grip of the chemical reactions that make us "angry," we do and say things we would never choose to do otherwise.

**The enemy perception problem**: When your body and emotions are in "fight or flight" mode, your child always looks like the enemy. This is biology, not choice - your threat-detection system is activated and targets the person in front of you.

**The practical implication**: Take a breath and wait until you calm down. You cannot think clearly or respond appropriately while in this biological state. The waiting isn't optional - it's required for any reasonable response to become possible.

### 4. Reflect on Your Own "Story"

**You can't change a painful childhood, but you can change what you're taking from it** - your "story" about what happened and what it means.

**The process**: Reflect on it, feel the painful feelings, but also consider new angles from your adult vantage point.

**Example 1 - The abandoned child**:
- Original story: "My father abandoned the family. I concluded I wasn't good enough."
- Rewritten story: "You were more than enough and his leaving had nothing to do with you."
- The work: Setting the record straight using adult understanding that a child couldn't have.

**Example 2 - The hit child**:
- Original story: "My mother hit me. I concluded I was somehow bad inside."
- Rewritten story: "Your mother was frightened and would have hit even the most angelic child in the world. You were just like any child: reaching out for love and attention in the only ways you knew."
- The insight: The problem was the parent's fear and lack of skills, not anything wrong with the child.

**Coming to terms with your story and rewriting it can be a painful process, but it's liberating. It's also the only path to being the parent you want to be to your child.** There is no alternative route - this reflective work is required.

### 5. De-Stress

**We all have a harder time being the best parents we can be when we're stressed out.** Stress depletes the resources needed for patient, thoughtful parenting.

**Develop a repertoire of habits that help you de-stress**:
- Regular exercise
- Yoga
- Hot baths
- Meditation

**The "no time" solution**: Involve the whole family in stress-reducing activities:
- Put on music and dance together
- Go for a walk in the woods
- Put everyone to bed with books early on Friday night for a quiet, relaxing evening and catching up on sleep

### 6. Get Support in Working Through Old Issues

**Parenting support groups** can be invaluable in supporting you to reframe your parenting positively.

**Therapy and coaching** are designed to help you heal old issues and move forward more happily in your life.

**There is no shame in asking for help. The shame is in reneging on your responsibility as a parent by damaging your child physically or psychologically.**

**Urgency**: If you think you need help, please don't wait. Reach out now.

## The Realistic Standard: Good Enough, Not Perfect

**No parent is perfect, because humans are by definition imperfect.** No matter how much we work on ourselves, we will not always impact our children positively.

**What minimizes harm**:
- Pay attention
- Use our inner Pause buttons
- Reflect on our own experience
- Keep our stress at manageable levels

**Winnicott's vindication**: Research has shown that if we meet their physical, emotional and intellectual needs, we can usually count on the growth imperative of mother nature herself to nurture our children into basically healthy adults.

**Final perspective**: And the places they're quirky? That just makes life more interesting. Imperfection in outcomes isn't failure - it's part of being human.
