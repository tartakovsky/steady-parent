## Core Premise: Why Emotion Coaching Matters for Siblings

**Emotion Coaching** is the process of teaching children about emotions, both their own and those of other people. This approach serves multiple interconnected purposes:

1. It enables children to "befriend" their emotions so they can regulate themselves better
2. It helps them get along with others and work through conflict
3. It allows them to get their needs met in a healthy way
4. It provides the foundation for effective problem-solving in relationships

### The Critical Problem: Siblings Don't Naturally Learn Prosocial Skills

Many parents assume that siblings will eventually learn to relate to each other in a loving and generous way over time. The logic seems reasonable: adults don't wrestle each other over TV remotes. However, **research shows that without explicit guidance, siblings don't necessarily learn how to interact in a prosocial manner**, especially when emotions run high.

The consequences of leaving this to chance are significant:
- Siblings often continue relating with underdeveloped social skills well into their teen years
- These negative interaction patterns erode the sibling bond over time
- Resentment and animosity can build up and linger for life

### The Alternative: What Happens When Parents Actively Coach

When parents support children in developing emotional intelligence skills, multiple positive outcomes emerge:
- Children learn to manage big emotions
- They develop genuine empathy for each other
- They gain the ability to navigate disagreements constructively
- Positive interactions increase
- The sibling relationship "sweetens and deepens"
- A lifelong foundation of communication and trust is established

**Key insight**: Squabbles diminish not because children stop having conflicting needs, but because they have the skills to work through the inevitable difficulties of human relationships. The sibling relationship becomes a "training ground" for all future relationships.

## The Six Strategies for Emotion Coaching Siblings

### Strategy 1: Empathize with Feelings, Set Limits on Actions

**The principle**: Kids are entitled to their feelings (which "have a way of showing up in human beings, like our arms and legs"), but all humans, even little ones, should be held responsible for what they do with their arms and legs and feelings.

This creates a clear distinction between the internal experience (acceptable, always) and the external behavior (subject to limits).

**Example scripts demonstrating this distinction**:

- "When your brother messes with your things you get really angry. You can tell him how it makes you feel in words. No hitting."
  - The anger is validated
  - A constructive outlet (verbal expression) is offered
  - The limit on physical action is stated clearly

- "You wish you could stay up half an hour later, like your sister. I know you can't wait until you're in third grade, so you'll be able to stay up later too. In the meantime, you can tell me if you're jealous of your sister, but you can't mess up her room."
  - The jealousy is acknowledged as understandable
  - The child's perspective (wanting the same privileges) is validated
  - A clear limit prevents the feeling from becoming destructive action

### Strategy 2: Brainstorm Conflict Resolution Rules Together

The approach is collaborative: parents work with kids to create a shared list of conflict resolution principles.

**Suggested rules for the list**:
- "Say what you need or want without attacking the other person."
- "Listen to what the other person says and repeat it to show you heard."
- "Stay respectful."
- "Stay in the current issue, don't bring up past conflicts."

**Implementation details that matter**:
- Post the list on the fridge (making it visible and accessible)
- Model referring to it yourself (demonstrating that these rules apply to everyone, including adults)

### Strategy 3: Teach Healthy Self-Calming Techniques

**The underlying challenge**: Most adults never learned to regulate their own emotions as children. This means these are skills we don't model well, which makes teaching them to children more difficult.

**The approach**: During a calm moment (not during conflict), make a game out of working with kids to create a list of healthy ways to calm themselves when angry. The goal is to enable them to have a civil discussion afterward and work things out.

**Example calming strategies to include on the list**:
- "Play the drums."
- "Write in your journal about how angry you are."
- "Dig a hole in the back yard and bury your angries."
- "Breathe and count backwards from 10."
- "Get a grownup."
- "Put on headphones and dance to loud music."
- "Kick the soccer ball outside."

**Critical implementation steps**:
- Post this list on the fridge alongside the conflict resolution rules
- Refer to the list yourself, in front of the children, when you are mad
- This modeling demonstrates that the strategies are real tools that adults actually use

### Strategy 4: Acknowledge Emotions Non-Judgmentally as They Occur

**The principle**: Expressing emotion verbally is the first step in managing it.

**The practice**: As you go through daily life, notice your kids' emotions and experiences and acknowledge them without judgment.

**Example acknowledgment scripts**:
- "No wonder you're angry! It's so frustrating when you work hard on something and it collapses like that."
- "This day really isn't going the way you wanted, is it?"
- "It sounds like you really miss your friend."

**What NOT to do**:
- Don't feel like you need to solve their problems
- Don't try to talk them out of their feelings
- Just acknowledge the feelings so they can acknowledge them too

The goal is validation and recognition, not problem-solving or correction.

### Strategy 5: Teach That Anger Always Has a Message

**The deeper understanding**: Anger always contains information. The message might be that a sibling trespassed a boundary, either:
- **Materially** (breaking their toy)
- **Emotionally** (disrespecting them)

The anger is performing a protective function: it defends against the trespass and against underlying hurt, powerlessness, sadness, or other vulnerable feelings.

**Key technique**: Acknowledging the underlying feelings is always more effective at diffusing anger than simply labeling the anger itself. Labeling anger without going deeper "just seems to reinforce it."

**Example script showing this approach**:
- "I hear you're very angry at Jimmy. It could really hurt to have him say that your idea was stupid."
  - The anger is acknowledged first
  - Then the underlying hurt (being called stupid) is named

**Special case: When children say "I hate her!"**

This requires different handling because **hate is not a feeling; it's a stance**, a position that says "I refuse to connect and work things through."

**Example script for the "hate" situation**:
- "You feel so angry at your sister right now that you feel like you hate her and you never even want to work things out with her. Sometimes when we are very, very angry, we feel that way, even toward people we love. Let's go tell your sister how hurt you are that she punched you, and how angry that makes you feel."

This script does several things:
- Translates "hate" back into the underlying feelings (anger, hurt)
- Normalizes feeling this way temporarily
- Maintains the expectation that connection will be restored
- Guides toward direct communication about the real feelings

### Strategy 6: Actively Encourage the Development of Empathy

**Two complementary approaches**:

**First**: Wonder aloud about other people's feelings to encourage understanding and comfort with emotions.

Example scripts:
- "Look at Michael. He's crying. I wonder if his feelings are hurt."
- "That little girl is sure mad. I wonder why?"
- "Keisha hurt herself. I wonder if we can do anything to help her feel better?"

These open-ended wonderings invite the child to practice perspective-taking without making it a lesson or demand.

**Second, and most important**: Offer your kids empathy for their own feelings. This is described as "the foundation of their developing empathy for each other." The logic here is that children learn what empathy feels like by receiving it, and this experiential knowledge is what enables them to extend it to others.

## The Parent's Own Development: A Prerequisite

A quote from Laura Davis and Janis Keyser captures an essential truth about this work:

"When your son and daughter are fighting with each other, you want them to learn to resolve their differences successfully, but you may have never learned to successfully work through conflicts yourself. Before you can teach your kids to listen, identify the problem, express their feelings, generate solutions, and find common ground, you have to learn those problem-solving skills yourself."

This highlights that:
- Parents need these skills before they can effectively teach them
- The list of skills parents need includes: listening, problem identification, emotional expression, solution generation, and finding common ground
- The parent's own development is not optional but prerequisite
