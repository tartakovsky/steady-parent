## The Core Problem: Leaky Cup Syndrome

When a child receives plenty of love and attention but still acts out in extreme ways (like peeing on a baby sibling), this signals that regular love and attention aren't addressing the root cause. The child needs a **different kind of loving attention** to heal the feelings driving the behavior.

The key insight: **Any time children act out, it's because they're feeling disconnected and driven by emotions and needs they can't handle.**

Even when children seem to act out just because they want something, this is a symptom that what they want has become more important to them than their relationship with you. This is a red flag indicating disconnect, either ongoing or caused by big emotions in the moment. "Bad" behavior is always a cry for help with feelings.

## The Emotional Backpack Model

Children's fears (like the fear that a parent doesn't love them as much as the new baby) don't simply go away on their own. The natural process requires:

1. First we must let ourselves experience the emotions
2. Then they dissipate

However, when children are too scared to approach those emotions, or when they've gotten the message that feelings aren't okay, they repress them. Think of this as **stuffing emotions down into a heavy emotional backpack** the child is carrying around.

The consequences of this stuffed backpack:
- Makes children cranky and whiny
- Feelings don't stay put - they bubble up seeking healing
- Children try to defend against these surfacing feelings by becoming controlling, aggressive, or territorial
- In extreme cases, they may literally "mark territory" like a small mammal (such as peeing on a sibling)

## Step 1: Daily Roughhousing That Produces Laughter

**Why this works:** Children who are aggressive have fear locked up inside. Nature has designed humans with a great way to loosen up fear: laughter.

**Types of physical games that help:**
- Games that mildly provoke a fear response
- Chasing them around the house
- "Bucking bronco" rides
- Kids-against-grownup pillow fights

**The mechanisms at work:**
- Laughter reduces fear and anxiety
- Laughter releases bonding hormones like oxytocin
- Every time you laugh together with your child, you're building trust and connection

**Expected outcomes:** Daily roughhousing will help your child be happier and more cooperative. Sometimes this alone is enough for children to work through their unhappiness.

**The deeper purpose:** When daily laughter isn't enough and a child still acts out provocatively, the laughter serves another function - it loosens up tears so the child begins to cry more easily. This is a GOOD thing because you want them to show you all the tears and fears they've been fighting off, so those emotions can heal.

## Step 2: Schedule a Meltdown

A **scheduled meltdown** is the same meltdown your child would have had at the supermarket, except you create conditions for it to happen at home when you can really listen and love them through it.

**Important clarification:** You're not creating the meltdown. The child already has all those feelings inside, making them contrary. You're welcoming those emotions so they can heal.

**Why meltdowns matter:** Tears are nature's way of healing big emotions. It's a huge gift if you can welcome your child's upsets and help them through the tempest.

**Your goal:** Help your child express what's going on. Most kids can't articulate it, and that's fine. Words aren't useful at this point because they pull the child out of their emotions. Instead, help them show you the upset.

---

## Step 3: Connect First to Create Warmth

Before attempting to access deeper feelings:
- Do a little roughhousing and laughing
- Then set a calm, kind limit

**Example for a child who feels displaced by a new baby:** Even saying "We'll have to stop soon... I know you wish you could have me to yourself all day" is likely to bring those feelings of need and hurt to the surface.

---

## Step 4: When Anger Emerges, Increase Empathy

**Why children get angry when you empathize:** When you connect with compassion, it moves them back into their heart, where all those feelings are - both good and bad. It doesn't feel good. So they lash out.

This anger response doesn't mean you're doing it wrong. It means you're getting close to the real feelings.

**Your goal:** Help the child feel safe enough to go behind the anger to what's underneath.

**What to say:** "Oh, Sweetie, I see you're upset... I'm sorry this is so hard."

**What heals:** If you can stay compassionate enough - which is the challenge for most parents - the child will cry. The crying is what's therapeutic, not the anger.

---

## Step 5: Stay Present Through the Storm

Most parents want to run in the other direction when children get upset. The alternative approach:
- Respond to anger with compassion
- Soften your heart
- The child will soften too and may cry

**Why more crying is better:** The child needs to show you the fear that you no longer love them, which is locked in their body.

**Physical release during meltdowns:**
- The child may thrash around
- They may sweat
- They may want to push against something
- All of this helps their body let go of the fear

**Safety boundaries:** Don't let them hurt you. Step back or hold them gently, but only if necessary to keep yourself safe.

**The key principle:** The more you create emotional safety with your compassion, the less likely they'll get aggressive.

**Self-regulation for parents:** Breathe your way through it. Remind yourself: THIS is the help your child was asking for when they acted out.

## Step 6: What If They Don't Cry

If the child doesn't break through to tears:
- Back off
- Step up connection and safety for a few days
- Use other preventive maintenance tools: empathy, roughhousing, special time
- These increase the sense of safety
- Then try again

## Step 7: What If They Yell "Shut Up"

**The instruction:** Stop talking.

**Why:** Words take your child out of their heart and into their head, making it harder for them to cry.

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't ask questions
- Don't give explanations
- Don't expect your child to articulate their feelings

**What TO do:** Just help them feel safe enough to cry.

**What to say:**
- "I'm sorry this is so hard..."
- "You're safe..."
- "I'm here..."
- "Everybody needs to cry sometimes."

**Teaching can wait:** There will be plenty of time to teach later.

## Step 8: What If They Yell "Go Away"

**The truth:** They don't mean it.

**What's actually happening:** The child is trying to regulate the intensity of the emotion. Because they feel safe with you, their feelings come up more intensely in your presence. So they're trying to send you away so they won't feel those unbearable emotions.

**The paradox:** They don't really want you to leave because they need you to see them safely through.

**If you leave:** Sure, the child will calm down - but that just means they've stuffed the feelings again and the feelings will pop out later.

**What to say:** "I'll move back to here... I won't leave you alone with these big feelings. I'll be right here when you're ready for a hug."

**With older children:** You might need to sit outside the door of their room the first couple of times you do this, until you earn their trust.

---

## Step 9: Honor the Grief

**The typical sequence:** After children express their fears, they collapse into your arms in tears. They might sob like their heart is broken. In a sense it is.

**Why this matters:** Crying in your arms is their chance to let that grief out and begin to heal it.

**How to respond:**
- Let them cry as long as they want
- If they stop, make loving eye contact
- If they have more feelings to get out, your loving gaze will unlock them
- If they're able to hold your gaze, they've let out what they needed to

## Step 10: Help Them Understand After Crying Stops

**What to expect:** They'll probably want to cuddle. They might want to change the subject.

**Simple acknowledgment:** "Those were some big feelings. That was hard work. Can I give you a big hug?"

**Storytelling technique:** If they're open to it, describe what happened in the form of a story:

"You were so mad and sad... You yelled at Mommy and tried to hit me... Mommy said 'No hitting! Hitting hurts!' and Mommy held you so you couldn't hit. Mommy will always keep everyone safe. You were so upset. You cried and cried. Everybody needs to cry sometimes. Then you were done crying, and Mommy hugged you and held you and we snuggled. Then we all felt better."

## The Outcomes and Why This Works

**Immediate effects:** You'll be amazed at how affectionate and cooperative your child is after you "hear and see" their feelings. They may fall asleep, or they may go on to have a wonderful evening with you.

**Understanding the intensity:** If you've ever felt better after someone you trust held you through a good cry, you'll know how healing this is. Multiply your adult experience by a factor of one thousand to understand the intensity for your child.

**The deeper benefit:** This process creates closeness between parent and child that makes it worth every bit of effort.

**Solving the original problem:** The child won't be acting out in extreme ways (like peeing on the baby) anymore because you gave them the kind of love and attention they actually needed.

---

## What Parents Need

**The challenge for parents:** This process may bring up big feelings from your own childhood.

**What to do about it:** Find a safe adult who will let YOU cry safely about all the feelings this brings up in you.

**Self-regulation during the process:**
- Breathe your way through it each time
- Use a little mantra to soothe yourself

## Key Distinction: Why Traditional Approaches Fail

**Why sticker charts don't work for this:** Punishment or reward systems like sticker charts are unlikely to be effective because they don't get to the root of the behavior.

**The prevention approach:** Refill your child's love tank and give them an emotional tune-up on a daily basis. This takes a lot of time and energy, but it works. When you connect with your child in the way they need, most of the time their behavior improves dramatically.

**But when prevention isn't enough:** If you're really giving all the love and attention you can and it isn't changing behavior, the child needs you to lovingly welcome all those big emotions and help them work through them.
