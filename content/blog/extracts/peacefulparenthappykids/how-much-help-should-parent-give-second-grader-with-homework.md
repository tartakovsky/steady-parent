# How Much Help Should Parents Give Second Graders With Homework

## Core Principle: Structure and Support vs. Doing the Work

There is a critical distinction between **providing structure and support** versus **doing the homework for the child**. Parents should not complete assignments for their children, but many young children genuinely need parental presence and interaction to successfully complete homework. This is not laziness or manipulation - it reflects normal developmental needs.

The distinction works like this: if you observe your daughter, you may see that she needs your help to begin, to stay focused, to understand the directions, to organize the work. These are all forms of support that do not involve doing the actual thinking or writing for her.

## Why Young Children Need Parental Presence During Homework

**Emotional anchoring enables cognitive function.** Many young kids need fairly constant interaction with parents while they complete their homework - not to do the work, but to keep them on track. Some children seem to need the parents' verbal "embrace" while they work just to sustain them through these new and not always pleasant tasks.

The mechanism: The parent's presence soothes the child's anxiety, giving them an anchor while they venture into a demanding new realm. This emotional security allows the child to access their higher-level executive functions needed to stay on track with the task.

**Second grade represents a wide developmental range.** There is a wide range of how independent a second grader is in doing homework. Needing significant hand-holding and structure is not unusual at this age - it is partly a maturity issue, but not a sign of something wrong with the child.

## Practical Setup for Homework Support

**Physical proximity matters at all ages.** Dr. Laura advises parents to sit near their children during homework time, doing paperwork of their own. If you need to tend to other children or make dinner, set up homework time in the kitchen near you.

**This support extends through adolescence.** Dr. Laura shares that her teenagers still do their homework in the family room while she makes dinner. While they are now very self-disciplined and manage their own work, she remains available if they want to ask a question, have her read over a paper, or simply because her presence helps keep them focused instead of succumbing to social media or phone distractions.

**Even high schoolers need engagement.** Your daughter will eventually do her homework completely by herself, but that will be in high school, and even then you will need to ask appropriate questions like "How's your homework situation tonight?" or "How's your paper going for History class?"

## The Case For Helping With "Easy" Tasks

The parent asked about whether to spell out an author's name for her child - a task that seems trivially simple. Dr. Laura's analysis reveals why helping is actually the better choice:

**The mechanics of writing are genuinely laborious for young children.** Before children are skilled in the mechanics of writing, it is hard for many kids to maintain the flow of their thoughts while they write. If they also have to struggle with spelling, writing becomes a chore.

**Why this matters for long-term outcomes:** If she feels like writing is difficult, she will do as little as possible of it. What you want is for her to love reading and writing so much that she can't wait to get to her reading journal. Feeling positively about homework is an important part of your daughter's enjoying school.

**The deeper relational benefit:** When we help our kids in little ways that they specifically solicit, it is clear to them that we love caring for them. They internalize that feeling of being loved and of having backup to help them when things feel tough. That lays the foundation for knowing that she can tackle obstacles because we are there if she needs support.

**Reframing the "don't help" advice:** Many experts advise you not to do anything your child could do herself. But Dr. Laura offers a different view: if your daughter asks you for help with something that you can easily help her with, it is good for your relationship, and actually helpful to her development, for you to extend the help rather than refuse.

**Important nuance:** This does not mean bending over backwards to do things for kids that they can do themselves. The principle applies specifically to small asks that are easy for you to fulfill.

## Setting Appropriate Limits on Help

**The "convenience principle" for limits:** If you didn't know the author's name and had to walk across the room to look at it, then you can't help her easily, and you would just tell her that kindly. It would be harder for her to look at it and write it than to have your help, but no big deal - she wouldn't expect you to walk across the room to look at something that was right in front of her.

**This limit only works when the child is emotionally regulated.** The above presumes she has a full cup emotionally. If she doesn't, she might have a meltdown when you kindly tell her you can't help her with this task at this moment.

## When Meltdowns Happen: A Hidden Opportunity

If the child has a meltdown over a refused request for help, that is actually good - she's showing you accumulated tension. This tension might be about:
- Homework itself
- Whether you're really available to meet her needs
- Something unrelated that we don't even know about, like what happened on the playground at school

**How to respond to the meltdown:**
1. Summon up your compassion
2. Hold her while she cries
3. Tell her you are always there for her and she is safe

**What happens after:** When she's done crying, she'll either fall asleep (in which case sleep is what she most needed at that moment) or more likely, she'll be relaxed and happier, able to tackle her homework with renewed fortitude. Sometimes we all need a good cry to let out our worries so we feel stronger and more resourceful.

## The Hidden Request Behind Homework Struggles

**When children seem to need "too much" help, look for unmet needs elsewhere.** Seven year olds still need a lot of "holding" from their parents - not just physically, but also psychologically. If a child is not getting as much as she needs (and every child is different), then she will almost certainly extract it from you in other ways, such as in homework encounters.

In this specific case, the mother is pregnant while parenting two children. Dr. Laura suspects this makes the mother wish her oldest was more mature than she actually is. The child's needs are not excessive - the parent's capacity is stretched.

## Why Yelling Backfires Completely

Yelling at a child about homework creates multiple negative consequences:

**It doesn't create positive associations.** Yelling certainly doesn't leave the child with a positive association about schoolwork - the opposite of the goal.

**It creates a relational deficit that requires extensive repair.** Researchers have found that every negative interaction in a relationship requires five very positive interactions to set things right again. So every time we yell at our kids we throw the relationship out of whack for awhile and give ourselves lots more work.

**It increases the very behavior you're trying to stop.** Yelling ratchets up the likelihood that your daughter will continue to needle you for attention. The attention-seeking behavior is a symptom of disconnection, and yelling creates more disconnection.

## The Developmental Timeline for Homework Independence

**The next five years are formative and finite.** Your daughter will need plenty of support and empathy from you for the next five years. These next five years will shape your daughter's entire future, because after this you'll have much less input into her homework, and the peer group will have much more influence than you do on most aspects of her life.

**Repair gets harder with time.** At that point (after these five years), repairing rifts in your relationship will get a lot harder, so this is the time to strengthen your relationship.

**Children do naturally mature.** Your daughter will continue to mature, and she will eventually do her homework completely by herself. But that milestone comes in high school, not second grade.

## When to Involve the Teacher

If your child has difficulty understanding the material, you can certainly work with her on it. But in that case it is also a good idea to let the teacher know what you're seeing so she can be sure your child is learning at school.

This applies to academic comprehension issues - not to the need for structure and support, which is developmentally normal.

## The Parent Self-Care Prescription

**What matters in parenting is not so much what we do, but how we make our kids feel about themselves.** And we can't make them feel good about themselves if we don't love caring for them. And we can't love caring for them if we don't make sure to care well for ourselves.

**Concrete recommendation:** Do whatever you need to in the way of self-care on an ongoing basis so that you regularly replenish your own internal resources. You'll need them to be the parent you want to be in the months ahead.

Being pregnant with two young children is acknowledged as challenging. But children's appropriate developmental needs don't go away just because the parent gets pregnant again. The solution is better self-care, not expecting the child to need less.

## Why Reward Charts Don't Work for This Child

The parent mentions that reward charts "do not seem to last" with her daughter and that "everything is a negotiation." Dr. Laura does not address reward charts directly, but her framework suggests why they might fail: the child's behavior is driven by emotional needs (connection, support, anxiety reduction) rather than by insufficient motivation. Rewards address motivation but not emotional needs.

## Key Distinctions

| What looks like... | May actually be... |
|---|---|
| Laziness | Genuine difficulty with laborious mechanics |
| Manipulation for attention | Legitimate need for parental "holding" |
| Immaturity that should be outgrown | Normal developmental needs for a 7-year-old |
| Easy tasks | Genuinely effortful work for a developing writer |
| Neediness | Attempts to get connection needs met |
