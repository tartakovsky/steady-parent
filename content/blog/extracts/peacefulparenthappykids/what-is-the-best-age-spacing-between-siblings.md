# Optimal Age Spacing Between Siblings: Physical and Psychological Considerations

## Historical Context

Until the advent of bottle feeding and food surpluses for nursing mothers, women's bodies were unlikely to conceive again soon after giving birth. At least 3 years between births appears to be the historical human norm.

Today, mothers can conceive again quickly, creating both the opportunity and responsibility of choosing what's best for the physical and psychological health of their babies.

## Physical Health Recommendations

### The 18-Month Minimum Conception Interval

An analysis of studies involving more than 11 million women, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (April 2006), found that the physical health of a baby is significantly better if the mother waits a minimum of 18 months after the previous birth before conceiving again.

**Why the Waiting Period Matters**:
- Women are often anemic for a full year after birth due to iron allocated to the baby and placenta, plus blood loss during delivery
- Babies conceived within the first 18 months after a birth face greater risk for delivery-related complications including anemia, premature birth, and low birth weight

**The 27-Month Guideline**: To give babies the best possible physical start, current thinking suggests they should not be born when their sibling is less than 27 months old (18 months post-birth conception + 9 months gestation).

**Global Health Context**: Research from countries where nutrients are less plentiful and health risks are greater shows that children born before their older sibling is at least three years old have reduced chances of survival.

## Psychological and Emotional Considerations

### The Kauai Longitudinal Study Findings

This famous study found that spacing children closer than two years apart was a risk factor for both children. The apparent cause was that neither child received enough attention from the mother to create the close mother-child bond that children need to flourish.

**Important Caveat**: Later data suggested this effect was primarily observed when families lived in poverty, which provides a significant additional stressor to the family.

**Supporting Evidence**: A Swedish study using a very different cohort supported these results. Additionally, many studies claim that closely-spaced second children test as less intelligent.

### The Self-Esteem Research

Dr. Jeannie Kidwell, a psychologist at the University of Tennessee, conducted a national survey of more than 1,700 teenage boys examining sibling spacing effects.

**Key Findings**:
- Children had a more negative view of themselves and their parents when their closest siblings were around two years apart
- The negativity disappeared when spacing was under one year or over four years

**The Explanation**: Children under four years old are not developmentally ready to share their parents. They experience intense resentment toward new siblings and lowered self-esteem because they feel "jilted."

**The Under-One-Year Exception**: If children are born within a year of each other, the older child doesn't resent the newcomer because they have no awareness of a time before the sibling arrived. However, this doesn't mean either child's needs are adequately met when they're within twelve months of age.

**Research Conclusion**: Based on combined research to date, Dr. Kidwell claims that four or more years of spacing is ideal to protect self-esteem and lessen competitiveness.

## The Four-Plus Year Spacing Experience

### Benefits Observed

**The Older Child's Adjustment**:
- By age four, children have their own "outside" life (such as preschool)
- They may experience brief panic at the new sibling's arrival but recover easily
- They often become doting, patient, and loving big siblings
- Long-term sibling relationships can be excellent with no meanness or conflict

**The Family Experience**:
- The family still feels cohesive despite the age difference
- Finding activities that work for all ages (like movies) can be challenging

### Realistic Expectations About Shared Play

Whether siblings will be playmates depends on multiple factors beyond spacing:
- Temperament
- Gender
- Individual interests

**Research on Play**: Studies show that same-gender, closely-spaced siblings are more likely to play together, but they are also more likely to be very competitive with each other.

**Example**: Even siblings with significant interests in common may approach the same activity differently (one wanting to build towers, another wanting to make blocks into a family).

## The Risk Factor Perspective

Close spacing represents a controllable risk factor, unlike most risk factors children may face. Caring for a baby is all-consuming. Adding work outside the home further dilutes the attention available to spread between children.

**The Key Insight**: While not all mothers will find close spacing problematic, it requires heroic measures to be fully responsive to two babies at the same time in a way that allows everyone to thrive.

## Mitigating Factors for Close Spacing

If close spacing occurs, several practices can help protect the older child from feeling displaced:

1. **Having the older child nearby for the birth** - avoiding separation during labor
2. **Tandem nursing** - continuing to nurse the older child while nursing the newborn
3. **Co-sleeping as a family** - maintaining the older child's nighttime proximity to parents
4. **Supportive extended family** - having additional caregivers to ensure individual attention

## The Bottom Line

**Physical Health Optimal**: Wait at least 18 months post-birth before conceiving (resulting in 27+ months between children)

**Psychological Health Optimal**: Four or more years of spacing to protect self-esteem and minimize competitiveness

**The Individual Choice**: This is a very personal decision. Control over timing isn't always possible, and parents who make their children a top priority can be good enough parents regardless of spacing. The key is going in with realistic expectations about the challenges close spacing presents.

## Summary of Research-Based Recommendations

| Spacing | Physical Health | Psychological Health | Considerations |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Under 12 months | Higher risk | Needs may not be met, but less resentment | Neither child aware of "before" |
| 12-27 months | Higher risk | Higher risk of displacement feelings | Most challenging window |
| 27-48 months | Acceptable | Moderate risk | Older child may struggle to share parents |
| 4+ years | Optimal | Optimal for self-esteem | Less shared play, but less competition |
