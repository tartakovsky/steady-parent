## Why Routines Matter for Children

Routines provide multiple developmental benefits beyond simple structure:

**Security and confidence** - Children feel more secure when they know what to expect. This predictability translates into genuine self-confidence because children develop trust in their environment and their ability to navigate it.

**Improved cooperation** - Children become more willing to cooperate when following a routine because they don't feel "pushed around." When activities follow a predictable pattern, children don't experience each request as an arbitrary demand from a parent, which reduces resistance and power struggles.

**Self-care habit formation** - Routines help children learn good self-care habits through consistent practice. When activities like bathing and brushing teeth happen at the same time each day, they become automatic behaviors rather than battles.

**Responsibility development** - The predictable structure of routines creates space for children to take ownership of tasks, gradually building their sense of responsibility.

## Why Start with Bedtime Routines

Bedtime routines make an ideal starting point for families new to routines because they contain **built-in rewards for children**: dedicated one-on-one time with parents. This natural incentive helps children accept the new structure more readily.

When introducing a bedtime routine, explicitly frame it to children as ensuring "quality time" with each of them every night. This framing shifts the routine from something imposed on children to something that benefits them directly, increasing their acceptance of the new system.

## The Multi-Age Routine Framework

### Core Principle: Differentiated but Unified Structure

The key insight for managing routines with children of different ages: **the family as a whole can still have a routine even though children of different ages need different things**. Some activities work for children together, while others must be age-appropriate and separate.

### Step-by-Step Process for Creating a Multi-Age Routine

**Step 1: Determine target bedtimes by working backwards from wake-up needs**

The fundamental principle: children should not need to be woken up in the morning. If you must wake your child, they are not getting enough sleep. Keep moving bedtime earlier until children wake naturally.

This approach grounds the entire routine in biology rather than arbitrary scheduling. It ensures children get adequate sleep, which affects everything from mood to cognitive function to cooperation levels.

**Step 2: Count backwards from target bedtime**

Once you have the target bedtime for each child, work backwards through the evening, mapping out what each child needs to be doing at each point. Write this down as you work through it.

**Step 3: Discuss the routine with children**

Talking with children about the proposed routine accomplishes two things:
1. Children may identify things you forgot, making the routine more practical
2. Discussion helps children feel ownership over the routine, which dramatically reduces power struggles

Give children as much choice as possible within the routine structure. Ownership transforms compliance from external pressure to internal motivation.

**Step 4: Create visual representations**

Print the schedule and post copies in key locations - on the bathroom door near bedrooms and on the refrigerator. Add photos of your children doing each activity.

**Involving children in creating the visual schedule** - taking the photos, gluing them on - transforms it from "your schedule" into "their schedule." This ownership distinction significantly affects how children relate to following the routine.

## Sample Multi-Age Evening Routine (3-year-old and 10-year-old)

### 6:00pm - 6:30pm: Family Dinner

Shared family time that anchors the evening routine. This provides connection before the separation that comes with staggered bedtimes.

### 6:30pm - 6:45pm: Table Clearing and Physical Play

**Everyone clears the table together** so there can then be five minutes of "roughhousing" or physical play.

The purpose of physical activity at this time is threefold:

1. **Reduces stress hormones** - Any physical activity that gets children giggling reduces the level of stress hormones in their bloodstreams, making it easier for them to fall asleep later.

2. **Builds connection** - Laughing with parents helps children connect, making them more cooperative when a parent needs to turn attention to getting a sibling to bed. The connection buffer helps children handle the temporary separation.

3. **Sibling bonding** - Laughing together helps siblings bond with each other.

**Critical timing note**: This physical activity must happen well before "lights out." If done too close to bedtime, children become too revved up to sleep. The 6:30-6:45pm timing provides enough buffer before the 8pm (younger child) and 8:30pm (older child) sleep times.

### 6:45pm - 7:15pm: Staggered Activities

**Three-year-old**: Bathtime followed by brushing teeth (with parent)

**Ten-year-old**: Quiet independent activity in his room after packing backpack for the next day

#### Why No Screens During This Window

TV, games, and all screens (including phones and tablets) reduce melatonin in the bloodstream. Melatonin is essential for helping children relax and move toward sleep. Screen time during the wind-down period actively interferes with the body's natural sleep preparation.

#### Managing Homework

Ideally, homework is completed before dinner. If not, this 6:45-7:15pm window is the fallback time for homework completion, but only if the older child can work relatively independently.

**Practical solution for dependent homework**: If the older child needs help with homework and the parent must supervise the younger child's bath, the older child can do homework on the floor outside the bathroom. This maintains supervision of the younger child while providing homework support.

The parent should "check in frequently" with the older child during this period regardless of what activity they're doing.

### 7:15pm - 7:40pm: Parallel Tracks

**Ten-year-old**: Showers, brushes teeth, puts on pajamas, sets out clothes and packed backpack for tomorrow

**Memory support**: The ten-year-old will probably need a sign on the wall to remember all the items on his checklist. This external prompt supports developing independence without constant verbal reminders from parents.

**Three-year-old**: Puts on pajamas, sets out clothes for tomorrow, and has story time with parent

### 7:40pm - 8:00pm: Younger Child Wind-Down and Sleep

**Ten-year-old**: Reads in bed independently

**Three-year-old**: Lights out, with parent lying with child for a few minutes in the dark for snuggling before extracting themselves

**Pre-emptive check-ins**: After leaving the room, the parent does check-ins every few minutes. This pattern helps the three-year-old feel safe enough to fall asleep.

**Sleep calculation basis**: This timing assumes the child wakes at 7am and still naps, making 11 hours of nighttime sleep appropriate.

### 8:00pm - 8:30pm: Older Child Connection Time

The ten-year-old, assuming a 7am wake time, still needs ten hours of sleep. Lights must be off by 8:30pm to allow half an hour for falling asleep, targeting a 9pm sleep onset.

**Activities during this 30-minute window**:

**Read to your child** - even though they can read independently. Reading aloud provides:
- Bonding time
- Intellectual development benefits
- More restful experience than self-reading (reading to oneself requires more active cognitive effort)

**Talk about their day** while lying on their bed together

**Snuggle, sing songs, say prayers** if that's part of family tradition

**Linger after lights out** - Rabbi Sandy Sasso is quoted: "in the dark together is when you see children's souls." The quiet darkness creates space for deeper conversation and connection.

## Eight Benefits of This Bedtime Routine Structure

### 1. Guaranteed One-on-One Connection Time

Each child gets special time to connect with the parent alone, and children can count on this happening every night.

**Why this matters increasingly with age**: For the ten-year-old, this reliable private time provides opportunity to raise difficult issues and feel heard. This becomes crucial as children approach the tween years.

### 2. Sleep Security Through Predictability

A safe, predictable bedtime routine is associated with better sleep for everyone in the family (backed by research studies), as well as happier, more secure children.

### 3. Self-Care Skill Development

As children grow older within this routine structure, they learn to bathe themselves and brush their own teeth because the parent has helped them develop the habit. The routine creates the scaffold for eventually independent behavior.

### 4. Next-Day Preparation Builds Competence

Packing a backpack and setting out clothes teaches children to think about the next day, making them more competent and independent.

**Immediate benefit**: Mornings become calmer when preparation happens the night before.

**Recovery benefit**: The routine allows children to remember forgotten things - that tomorrow needs a change of clothes for mural painting, or a homework assignment they forgot about. These items can still be addressed the evening before.

**Diagnostic value**: If children frequently remember such things at bedtime, it signals that the after-school routine needs attention. Bedtime revelations become feedback about other routine gaps.

### 5. Schedule as Authority (Not Parent as "Bad Guy")

Having a routine with times attached removes the parent from the role of "bedtime cop." The parent can point to the schedule as the authority - "It's just the schedule" - rather than being the personal enforcer of an arbitrary rule.

### 6. Foundation for Teenage Sleep Health

Having a set bedtime as a young child helps children, once they become teenagers, to think in terms of how much sleep they need to take good care of their bodies. This early conditioning makes them more likely to stay well-rested even when they have more autonomy over their schedules.

### 7. Daily Check-In Opportunity

Separate time with each child is particularly valuable for families where parents and children are apart all day. This structure increases the chance of hearing what's bothering children.

**Critical function for pre-teens**: The essential one-on-one time with the older child keeps the parent connected during the transition to tween years - a period when peer issues can crowd out the parent-child relationship even though the child desperately needs to stay anchored to the parent.

### 8. Calming Activities Enable Faster Sleep Onset

Bedtime routines centered around baths and reading calm children and allow them to fall asleep faster, eliminating tossing and turning.

**The "not tired" misconception**: Many children claim they aren't tired when they are actually restless because they are overly wound-up. A calming routine addresses the underlying agitation rather than taking the child's self-report at face value.

**Reading as bedtime habit**: A routine that allows children to stay up longer if they are reading creates the habit of reading. Most children won't choose reading if a computer is available - the screen is more immediately stimulating. By eliminating screens and providing books, the routine channels the child toward reading.

**Melatonin protection**: Computers and TV suppress melatonin, so children should definitely not use screens in the hour before bed. Reading relaxes children and allows melatonin to flood their bodies. An additional detail: ensure lights are not too bright, as bright light also suppresses melatonin.

## Implementation Guidance

### Timeline for Establishment

Give a new routine a couple of months to get established before evaluating or adding to it. Routines take time to become automatic, and premature judgment may lead to abandoning a system that would eventually work.

### Sequence of Routine Development

After the evening routine is established, tackle morning routines next, with the goal of everyone getting out the door peacefully. The evening routine actually makes mornings easier through the preparation activities (packed backpack, clothes set out), creating a multiplier effect.

### Expected Outcome

Following this approach, families should notice "how much more smoothly everything runs" - the routine reduces friction, conflict, and daily negotiations by replacing them with predictable, child-owned structure.
