# Single Parenting: When There Is No Other Parent to Hand Off To

**Context:** Dr. Laura Markham addresses a specific challenge facing single parents who are parenting alone, potentially 24/7, with no partner to hand children off to during difficult moments.

## The Core Problem: The Witching Hour

The challenge Dr. Markham addresses is the reality faced by single parents during the **"witching hour"** - that time of day when everyone is tired, hungry, and ready to have a meltdown. The specific difficulty is when you are:

- The only parent on duty (either temporarily or 24/7)
- Parenting more than one child
- Facing multiple children's needs simultaneously during high-stress moments

The question parents ask: What do you do when you're alone with multiple children and everyone is falling apart?

## The Central Strategy: Prevention Over Reaction

Dr. Markham's core recommendation is emphatic: **"Prevention, prevention, prevention."**

The reasoning behind this approach is critical: By the time you get into crisis mode, where a child is having a full meltdown and you're the only parent on duty with other children to tend to, **you are only doing triage**. At that point, there isn't much you can do - you're just trying to survive the moment.

This is why prevention is so important - not because it makes parenting perfect, but because once the meltdown happens, your options become severely limited.

## The Pre-Emptive Protocol: Before the Witching Hour

Dr. Markham provides a specific sequence of actions to implement **before** the difficult time of day arrives:

### Step 1: Don't Wait for the Witching Hour

The key insight is that you must start addressing needs before children fall apart. If you wait until children are already tired, hungry, and dysregulated, you've already lost your window of opportunity.

### Step 2: Healthy Snacks Immediately

When you first pick up your kids and get them home, **get some healthy snacks into them right away**. This addresses the physical foundation of emotional regulation - hungry children cannot regulate their emotions effectively.

### Step 3: Roughhousing and Physical Play

After snacks, engage in **roughhousing and physical play**. This isn't optional entertainment - it serves a specific purpose in resetting children's emotional state.

### Step 4: Generate Giggling

**Giggling is described as "nature's way of letting off anxiety."** The laughter helps children unload their fears and stresses from the day. Dr. Markham frames it as children being able to "giggle them out" - releasing the accumulated tension through laughter.

## The Science: Why This Protocol Works

### The Oxytocin Connection

The roughhousing and giggling sequence releases **oxytocin** in children. This produces two crucial effects:

1. **Increased bonding:** Children become more bonded with the parent
2. **Increased cooperation:** Because they feel more connected, children become more likely to do what you ask them to do - they become more cooperative

### Building Resilience for Hard Tasks

The protocol also gives children **resilience to handle unpleasant tasks**. Specifically mentioned is homework, which Dr. Markham acknowledges is inherently an unpleasant, sometimes anxiety-producing task.

When children have had their emotional cup filled through play and laughter, they can:
- Sit down and do homework without fighting with siblings
- Approach difficult tasks from a better emotional place
- Handle the frustration that comes with challenging activities

The logic: A child who is emotionally depleted will fight with siblings during homework. A child who has recently experienced connection, play, and laughter has the emotional resources to handle the challenge.

## The Breakdown Lane Metaphor

Dr. Markham uses a powerful **car breakdown metaphor** to illustrate the difference between prevention and crisis management:

**The breakdown lane:** When your child is having a meltdown and you're the only parent on duty with other children to tend to, you're in the breakdown lane. At this point, all you can do is call the tow truck. Your options are severely limited.

**Preventive maintenance:** If you remember to do preventive maintenance (the snacks, roughhousing, giggling protocol), you can avoid going to the breakdown lane - at least so often.

The key insight is not that prevention eliminates all meltdowns, but that it **reduces their frequency**. The phrase "at least so often" acknowledges that some meltdowns are inevitable, but preventive strategies significantly reduce how often you end up in crisis mode.

## Summary: The Single Parent Survival Protocol

For single parents facing the witching hour alone with multiple children:

1. **Do not wait** until children are already falling apart
2. **Feed them healthy snacks** immediately upon pickup/arrival home
3. **Engage in roughhousing** and physical play
4. **Generate giggling** to help them release accumulated anxiety
5. **Understand the biology:** This releases oxytocin, increasing bonding and cooperation
6. **Recognize the stakes:** By the time you reach crisis mode, you're just doing triage
7. **Accept imperfection:** The goal is reducing meltdowns, not eliminating them
