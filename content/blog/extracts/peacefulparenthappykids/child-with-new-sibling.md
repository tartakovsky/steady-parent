# Helping Children Adjust to a New Sibling

## Core Problem: The Displaced Child's Perspective

When a new baby arrives, the older child experiences a fundamental loss. Elizabeth Berger captures this perfectly: the child who was once "the center of your universe" has been "displaced from this paradise." While the parent coos at the new baby, the older child feels cast aside. This creates a profound sense of loss that drives problematic behavior.

**The key insight**: You cannot turn back time to when the older child was your sole focus, but understanding their frustration helps you counteract their sense of loss. Expressions of love, gestures of devotion, and moments of intimacy help the displaced child feel less deserted and alone. Helping them recapture a sense of shared joy in the relationship "turns down the fuel of their hate" and smooths the pathway to becoming a loving, protective, sharing person.

## Why Children Act Out

**Acting out is communication through behavior**. When children have big feelings they cannot put into words, they act them out to show you. The behavior is a symptom, not the core problem. If you want to change the behavior, you must help the child with the emotions or needs driving the behavior.

**Critical warning**: Getting stuck in reacting and punishing makes things worse. Punishment is likely to make the child more defiant and aggressive. Instead, address the source of the behavior to prevent it in the future.

**Example: When a toddler pees on the baby**. This extreme behavior is a red flag that the child needs help with their emotions. Yes, you set a limit, but every child already knows they shouldn't pee on the baby. The issue is that they couldn't manage those big feelings enough to stop themselves.

**What if the child doesn't seem to care about right and wrong?** This is actually a symptom that the child doesn't care that their action would upset you. It means they currently consider their connection to you less important than doing what they want. This is a red flag that you need to rebuild your connection with them.

## The Evolutionary Root of Sibling Rivalry

**Resource scarcity programming**: The child must share the sometimes scarce resource of your time and attention. A sibling means they get less. Parents know there's still enough love to go around, but to the child, sharing resources could reduce their chances of survival.

**The phone analogy**: Children act out as soon as you get on the phone. Attending to a sibling is like that, but worse. Their genes haven't changed much since the Stone Age. Unconsciously, they worry that your decreased attention could be a major threat. Their primitive brain asks: if a tiger jumped out of the bushes, who would you save?

**When rivalry resurges**: It starts when the baby is born, but there's usually another surge of open jealousy when the baby begins crawling and getting into the older child's things. A sibling can become a renewed threat at any developmental stage.

**Research finding**: Study after study shows that when parents are able to create a strong positive bond with each of their children, there's less sibling rivalry. This is why feeding the "hungry heart" is the cure, not punishment.

## The Five Strategies for Feeding the Hungry Heart

### 1. Re-connect Frequently Throughout the Day

**The disconnection cycle**: When children have strong negative feelings, they get overwhelmed by those emotions and their warm connection with you gets lost. This can happen many times a day as children feel frustrated, disappointed, hurt, sad, or defeated. These feelings swamp them, disconnect them from their own internal compass of the heart, and leave them feeling isolated and adrift.

**The solution**: Children need you to reconnect with them over and over, many times a day. Methods include:
- A warm smile
- A big hug
- A joke that gets them laughing

The key is frequency. Reconnection is not a one-time event but an ongoing practice.

### 2. Empathize While Setting Limits

**The common parental response**: When the older child is loud near the baby, overly zealous in their hugs, or has a tantrum because you're changing the baby and didn't come right away, most parents want to snap at them. "Can't he see that I have my hands full?"

**The better approach**: Train yourself to empathize as you set limits. Example script: "You wish I could come right away when you need me, I hear you...I will be with you as soon as my hands are free."

**Why this works**: Empathizing while setting limits protects your connection with your child. That connection is the only reason they follow your guidance in the first place. Without it, you lose your influence.

### 3. Let Them Be Little

**The paradox**: Sure, they can dress themselves. And yes, your hands are more likely to be full now that you have a baby. But that's exactly why they want you to help them. They need to know you'll always be there when they need you, even though there's a new baby in the family.

**The developmental sequence**: Once the older child is secure that they can still count on you, they'll be free to explore the part of themselves that wants to be grown-up and powerful. This grown-up self includes nurturing and protecting their little sibling. Security comes first; independence follows.

**Warning**: Pushing independence too fast because you're busy with the baby backfires. It increases insecurity and rivalry.

### 4. Keep Your Relationship Balance Positive

**The 5:1 ratio**: Research with adults repeatedly shows that healthy relationships need at least five positive interactions to make up for every negative interaction.

**The hidden toll of irritation**: Because kids live so much in the moment, and because parents feel guilty about yelling, we often overlook the toll that our irritation takes on our relationship. Every irritable moment costs something.

**When you get irritable, apologize**. Example script: "You don't deserve to be yelled at, no matter what...All of us need to express our anger in a way that's respectful of each other...I'm working hard to do that, so you can learn to do it, too."

**Critical warning**: Resist the urge to blame. Don't say "If you would behave, I wouldn't have to yell." This undermines the repair.

**After apologizing**: Find a way to have at least five positive interactions and enjoy your child. This is what puts the sweetness back into your relationship.

### 5. Daily Special Time

**What special time provides**: One-on-one time gives the child the essential, but often elusive, experience of the parent's undivided, 110% attentive, loving presence.

**The maintenance requirement**: Just for maintenance, every child needs one-on-one time to connect with a parent every single day, even if it's only for 20 minutes. When there's more than one child, especially if one is a baby, this can be hard to do. But it's worth figuring out because it keeps your bond with your older child strong at a time when your child most needs you.

**Troubleshooting when special time isn't working**:
1. Check whether you're giving your child your full attention
2. Check whether you're letting them take the lead
3. If still struggling despite daily special time, ensure most of your interactions are empathic
4. Give your child explicit permission to express their tears and fears about sharing you with their sibling

**The permission factor**: Sometimes children suppress their grief about the new sibling. They need explicit permission to express these difficult feelings.

## The Bottom Line

**Connection is the foundation**: Connection supports your child through whatever challenges they're facing and helps them thrive. It makes it more likely that your children will get along with each other as they get older. And it makes your child want to cooperate rather than acting out.

**The ultimate principle**: "In the end, it is always about love. Love never fails."

**Acknowledgment of limits**: Even when doing daily special time and empathizing consistently, some children still act out. This suggests that sometimes love and affection alone aren't enough, and additional approaches may be needed.
