## Why Moving Is Especially Hard for Children

Moving disrupts every aspect of life that families take for granted. Adults must re-organize household systems, figure out where to shop, learn how to navigate new routes, and discover good playgrounds. Everything previously automatic must be consciously re-invented.

For children, this disruption is even more difficult because:

- **They lose friends** without having chosen to leave them
- **Sleep becomes disrupted** - they don't fall asleep easily, don't sleep well, and wake up in unfamiliar surroundings
- **They didn't make the decision** to move and can't imagine what the change will mean for their lives
- **They often have cranky parents** who are struggling with additional tasks and may be experiencing their own sense of loss

**Age-specific reactions to moving:**
- **Big kids** (like a 7-year-old) often get angry and sad
- **Little kids** (like a 4-year-old) become clingy
- **Toddlers** may not understand what a move is and often regress in their development

## Core Principle: Honor the Grief While Holding the Vision

The overarching framework for helping children through a move involves two simultaneous approaches:

1. **Honor their loss** - Acknowledge and validate their feelings of sadness and anger
2. **Hold the vision** - Maintain confidence in the wonderful new life that awaits

This dual approach is essential because children need space to grieve what they're losing while also needing reassurance that good things are coming. Suppressing the grief makes adjustment harder; ignoring the future makes the grief feel hopeless.

## Announcing the Move: Prepare for Emotional Reactions

**Key insight:** Parents are usually excited about the move (or at least think it's a good idea) because they made the decision. Children didn't make this choice and probably feel worried about what they can't imagine.

**What NOT to do:** Don't try to talk your child out of their feelings.

**What TO do:** Listen, acknowledge, and reassure simultaneously.

**Example script for responding to a child's sadness:**

*"Yes, this does mean a new school for you.... I know that's a big change, and I know you'll miss your friends and your school... It's a loss, and it's understandable that you feel sad. That sadness feels hard, I know. And I also know that it's good - it shows how much you value your friends and your school....*

*I know it's hard to imagine, but you will make new friends and find good things about your new school. Our whole family will be making this move together, and we will get through it together by supporting each other....*

*The good news is that there's a great school just a few blocks away, with a terrific playground. It's so close that you can walk, so you won't have to take the bus any more."*

This script demonstrates several techniques:
- Validates the feeling ("it's understandable")
- Reframes the sadness as healthy ("it's good - it shows how much you value...")
- Expresses confidence in their ability to adapt
- Emphasizes family unity through the transition
- Ends with concrete positive details about the new situation

**For very young children who can't understand the concept of moving:**
- Act it out with stuffed animals
- Emphasize that your child and everyone else in the family will be going together
- Address the common worry that they'll be left behind

## Parent Self-Care: Put on Your Own Oxygen Mask First

**The #1 rule for dealing with stress is getting enough sleep.**

The logic chain:
1. Moving is very stressful
2. Stressed children require MORE patience from parents
3. Exhausted parents cannot be patient
4. Therefore: Stop packing that box and go to bed

This isn't optional or a nice-to-have - it's foundational to being able to help your children through the transition.

## Creating Predictability Through Previewing

**Goal:** Help your child know what to expect.

**Best approach:** Visit your new place if at all possible.

**What to preview (not just the new home):**
- The playground
- The new school (at least from the outside)
- Local food spots (roadside stand, best pizza, bakery)
- The local library - get excited about fliers on the bulletin board about kids' classes and activities

**Why the library visit matters:** It shows concrete activities and connections available to them, not just abstract ideas about "making new friends."

## The Moving Book: A Powerful Preparation Tool

**Format:** Photos with captions, glued to paper, laminated, three-hole punched, in a notebook.

**Structure:**

1. **Opening:** Photo of your family where you live now with a "once upon a time" framing
   - Example: *"Once upon a time, the Greene family lived in an apartment in New Jersey...."*

2. **Current life:** Photos of your family doing things the kids love in your neighborhood

3. **The transition:** Explain the move simply
   - Example: *"Then Mommy got a job in Texas and we moved across the country a long way away."*
   - Include a photo of a map with a line showing the journey

4. **Acknowledging feelings + concrete coping:**
   - *"Shannon and Michael were worried about saying goodbye to their friends, but we had a potluck and took pictures and got everyone's addresses. It will be fun to zoom with everyone to stay in touch...."*

5. **Mixed emotions framing:**
   - *"Even though we are sad to say goodbye, Shannon is excited about having her own room and Michael is excited about the playground being so close to our new place."*

6. **Reassurance about belongings:**
   - *"All of our furniture and toys will travel in the moving van but our family will drive with our cat and of course our special blankies in our car...."*

7. **Key message:** *"A family always moves together."*

8. **Happy ending:** End with photos of things to look forward to
   - Cinnamon rolls at the new bakery
   - The climbing structure at the new school
   - Photos of the new place (inside and out)
   - Plans like painting a room yellow or hanging a swing
   - Final photo: *"Our Happy Family in our new place"*

**Living document approach:** Start reading the book now and add new pages as you think of them:
- To address something your child is sad about
- To give them something additional to be excited about

## Honoring Grief: Specific Rituals and Activities

**Core principle:** It's okay - and in fact healthy - for kids to express their sadness about saying goodbye to everything they've known. This expression makes their adjustment easier in the new place.

**Concrete grief-honoring activities:**

1. **Friend visits:** Visit with their friends to take photos, exchange addresses, and say goodbye

2. **Favorite spot goodbyes:** Go to favorite spots in town to say goodbye. Add photos to the Moving book with your child's words about what they love
   - Example: *"I love this playground because it has the best swings."*

3. **Written farewells:** Write goodbye and thank you letters

4. **Dinner sharing ritual:** Go around the table at dinner and each share:
   - Something you love that you will miss about your current life
   - Something you're looking forward to about your new life

5. **Empty house walkthrough:** Once the house is empty, walk through it together saying goodbye to each room

## Giving Children Control

Children cope better with major transitions when they have agency. Here's how to provide that:

**Decision-making opportunities:**
- What color to paint their room
- Where to put furniture or toys
- For older kids: Give them a budget and let them do some decorating in their room
- If old enough: Let them plot the route and be the navigators

**Warning about decluttering:** This may seem like the perfect time to get rid of clutter, but forcing your child to give things away may compound their sense of loss.

**Better approach to belongings:**
- Offer the opportunity rather than forcing: *"Here's a box to pack things you want to keep, and a bag for stuff to give away that you don't need any more..."*
- Model your own process of making those decisions
- Don't force it

**Reassurance about belongings:**
- Make sure kids know that toys going in boxes are going with them to the new place
- Let them write their name on boxes
- Let kids decorate boxes of their stuff - this keeps them busy while packing AND reassures them these boxes will be easy to find after moving

**Special possessions strategy:** Give each child a small box to fill with their most special things that they can decorate and take in the car with you (not in the moving truck).

## Maintaining Stability Through Predictability

**Principle:** The more predictability, the more quickly your child will adjust.

**What this means practically:**
- Keep your child's schedule the same as much as possible
- Don't add more changes during this time

**Specific warning:** This isn't the time to transition from crib to toddler bed. The move itself is enough change.

## Prioritizing Kids' Rooms During Setup

**Strategic unpacking order:**
1. Everything for kids' rooms should be colorfully marked
2. These boxes should go into the moving truck LAST
3. They should come off FIRST
4. Set up kids' rooms before anything else

**The logic:** The rest of the house may be in chaos and you may have to order take-out, but your child will have a calm, safe space surrounded by familiar things.

**Multiple benefits of this approach:**
- Helps the child adjust and feel good about the move
- Gives them a safe place to play while you set up the rest of the house
- Reduces their stress while parents deal with unpacking chaos

**Tactical tip:** Shut the door to your child's room and start unpacking it completely before moving to other areas.

## Fun Activities Upon Arrival

**The tension:** You will be super-busy unpacking and will feel pressure to get settled.

**Why it's worth the investment:** A little energy keeping kids entertained with fun activities (besides screens) pays dividends in their adjustment.

**Immediate activity ideas:**
- Give kids the moving boxes to make a rocket ship, a tunnel, or a fort

**Daily practice:** Take a break every day to take the kids out into the new community. This gives them something to look forward to and helps them connect to good things in their new life.

**Community connection activities:**
- Go to the playground
- Find the best pizza
- Get each child their own library card and a bunch of books
- **Best of all:** Find a group for them to connect with other children

## Maintaining Old Friendships

**The challenge:** Staying in touch when we move is hard. Our attention shifts. And it feels painful.

**Key insight:** Kids can't really stay in touch by themselves, but it makes their transition easier, so it's worth it for parents to help them.

**Specific strategies:**
- Set up zoom calls
- If kids don't know what to say to each other, let them play simple online games together (like checkers) that help them connect and engage
- Send photos and write letters
- Talk about their friends

**What to expect over time:** As children connect to new people, they'll focus less on old friends. This is natural and healthy. They'll cope better if this is a gradual process where they can control the pace, rather than an abrupt cutoff.

---

## The Adjustment Timeline

**What to expect:** Moves are often overwhelming - emotionally and physically - for everyone in the family. Asking children to leave behind the only life they've known is asking a lot of them.

**Reassurance:** Children do recover and set down new roots in their new community. In a year or so, they'll have moved on emotionally.

**The parent's role during this time:** Honor their loss while holding the vision of the wonderful new life that awaits them.
