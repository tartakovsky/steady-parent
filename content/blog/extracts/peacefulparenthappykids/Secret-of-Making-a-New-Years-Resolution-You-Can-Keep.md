## Why Most New Year's Resolutions Fail

Most resolutions fail not because people lack willpower or don't try hard enough, but because of three fundamental issues:

**1. The goal itself is genuinely hard.** If it were easy, it wouldn't require a formal resolution in the first place. The difficulty is inherent to the task, not a personal failing.

**2. Resolutions are typically wishes, not plans.** Saying "I want to stop yelling" is an intention, not a strategy. To accomplish anything hard, you need to break it into small chunks with a step-by-step plan, support yourself to accomplish each step, and keep revising the plan when you hit walls. Without this structure, intentions float without actionable direction.

**3. People don't give themselves enough support.** This manifests in several ways:
- Not asking for help from others
- Never committing aloud and publicly, so the resolution never "grows roots"
- Lacking self-compassion when making missteps, which leads to giving up entirely before the resolution has a chance to flower

The core reframe: intention is only the first step. The symbolic fresh start of a new year does provide extra momentum, but that momentum alone cannot sustain change.

## The Complete Framework for Resolutions That Succeed

### Step 1: Start by Supporting Yourself

**The gardening metaphor:** Seeds don't germinate on concrete. Flowers bloom when you cultivate the soil first. This means addressing your own foundational needs before attacking the behavior you want to change.

**Concrete example for "stop yelling" resolution:**
- Get enough sleep
- Monitor your own moods
- Cut out stress in your life where possible

**Why this works:** Your child acts better when their needs are met - you work the same way. Intention will only take you so far. You must address the needs and feelings that drive your behavior, because behavior is downstream of needs.

### Step 2: Hone Your Desire

Ask yourself:
- Why do you want this goal?
- What will be different in your life once you achieve it?

**Picture concretely what your life will look like** to whet your appetite and program your subconscious. Visualization makes the goal feel real and desirable rather than abstract.

**Core formula: Fierce desire + Intention = the Seed of your Resolution.** Without that seed, nothing grows. Desire provides the motivational fuel that intention alone cannot supply.

### Step 3: Commit Yourself - On Paper and In Public

**Why public commitment matters:** Once you set an intention publicly, you marshal resources you never suspected you had available, from both inside and out. There's a psychological shift when others know your goal.

**Two research-backed writing practices:**

1. **Carry your intention with you:** Write your intention down and put it in your pocket. Example: "I am more and more able to regulate my own emotions." Research shows that thoughts we write down and physically carry with us are more likely to blossom. The physical act of carrying creates ongoing subconscious reinforcement.

2. **Dispose of what you want to eliminate:** Write down the thing you want to get rid of (e.g., "Yelling and threats!") and throw it in the garbage. Research shows this lessens its hold on you. The symbolic disposal creates psychological distance from the unwanted behavior.

### Step 4: Make a Plan

**The only way anyone ever met a goal was by breaking it into little pieces and completing one day at a time.**

For any resolution, your plan should answer:
- How will you support yourself to accomplish your resolution?
- What will you actually do to achieve your goal?
- What will you do in the moment when you start to slip?
- How will you measure your success?

**Write your plan down.** The act of writing forces specificity and creates accountability.

### Step 5: Take One Small Step Every Day

**Structure your daily practice:**
- Assign yourself a very reasonable task for each day
- Build in one day every week free for catch-up or time off

**Example daily tasks for "stop yelling" resolution:**
- "When you notice you're getting irritated, STOP, DROP (your agenda) and BREATHE!"
- "Get up ten minutes earlier to listen to a meditation audio"
- Or start even more foundationally: "Go to bed half an hour earlier every night"

**Make it visible and trackable:**
- Put daily tasks on your calendar
- Create a chart to check off daily progress
- Put the chart in a public place
- Let your kids draw you a star on days you don't yell

**Why consistency matters:** Every day you stick to your plan, you make the next day easier. The compounding effect of daily practice builds momentum over time.

### Step 6: Take It One Day at a Time

**One year equals 365 opportunities to get yourself back on track.** This reframe transforms a year-long commitment into 365 individual choices.

**The daily recommitment:** Every day when you wake up, you'll need to re-commit yourself. Big changes are daunting - if change were easy, you'd already be doing it.

**The moment-by-moment choice framework:** You have a choice between love and something else - fear, being right, or indulging in a tantrum. Choose love. Then repeat. Over and over again, all day long.

**Building tolerance for discomfort:** It's really hard, but it gets easier. The progression works like this:
1. You can do anything for an hour
2. From there, it isn't such a big stretch to go a whole afternoon
3. Before you know it, you've clocked a day
4. Then a week of your new life

### Step 7: Make It a Habit

**Why most resolutions get derailed:** They aren't sustained long enough to create a new habit.

**Timeline for habit formation:**
- Habits need to be repeated daily for at least 30 days to become entrenched
- To rewire your brain to stop yelling, it usually takes about three months

**The watering metaphor:** Check in every day and take a positive action toward your goal. Think of this as watering your resolution.

**Managing expectations:** Don't lose heart if your resolution isn't flowering during the first month. You should be able to see "shoots poking up" and maybe some "buds forming" - in other words, celebrate every bit of progress in the right direction, not just the final result.

### Step 8: Handle Days When You Blow It

**Accept this in advance:** Of course those days will happen. Everyone will have bad days and setbacks. Forgive yourself in advance - this normalizes setbacks rather than treating them as moral failures.

**Make a plan now for tough moments** so you can get back on track when they happen. Planning in advance removes decision fatigue during difficult moments.

**The learning reframe:** If you learn from times when you fall short, it's not a total loss. In fact, if it keeps you on track in the future, it's a win.

**Replace self-criticism with two questions:**
1. What would have helped me today to keep my resolution?
2. How can I give myself that support from now on?

**Concrete example:** If your intention is to stop yelling and you notice you're always impatient at bedtime, then rethink your evening routine. This is creating the nourishing conditions that your resolution needs to blossom.

### Step 9: Review and Revise

**Plans must evolve with reality.** For instance, if you're trying to stop yelling, you'll find that most of the time you're already yelling before you even notice.

**Progressive refinement example (for stopping yelling):**
1. First goal: Shut your mouth as soon as you realize you're yelling
2. Over time: Notice sooner and close your mouth faster
3. Then: Become aware of anger mounting before you open your mouth
4. Eventually: Notice as you start building up an attitude of annoyance

This shows how awareness itself develops in stages, and goals should match your current level.

**Daily review practice:**
- Check your plan every single day
- Give yourself lavish positive reinforcement for every day you take a step forward
- This should be often since you're tackling just one small task each day
- Cheer yourself on at every step

**When it's not working:** Ask if you need "sunshine and fertilizer" (self-love). Remember that your behavior is driven by your own needs and feelings. Address them and you'll see your behavior change.

**Self-care and self-compassion are essential to positive parenting.** Find whatever support you need to help you make your intention a reality.

## Core Principles

**There's no deadline.** The important thing is that you're headed in the right direction. Even two steps forward, one step back will get you where you're going.

**Any goal worth achieving takes time and hard work.** Sometimes the impossible just takes a little longer.

**Behavior change is downstream of self-care.** You cannot simply will yourself to behave differently. You must address the underlying needs and feelings that drive the behavior in the first place.

## Key Quote

"The moment one commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred... Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Begin it now." - Goethe
