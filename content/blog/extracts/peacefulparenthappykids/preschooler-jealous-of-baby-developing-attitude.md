# Helping a Preschooler Adjust to a New Sibling

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids

## Understanding the Root Cause: It's Grief, Not Just Jealousy

When a preschooler acts out after a new sibling arrives, the behavior appears as anger, defiance, and aggression. However, **anger is always a defense against other, more threatening emotions: hurt, fear, sadness**. The child is lashing out at the sibling and developing an attitude toward parents rather than letting themselves feel their devastation at having lost their place as the special only child.

The child feels mortally wounded and heartbroken. They are in mourning with no words to express what they have lost. What makes it worse is that they feel hateful toward the sibling, and every time they express it they lose parental love. They become trapped in tangled up angry emotions, which cause them to lash out. They feel terrible about themselves for being so "evil." They feel parental anger and sense the parent giving up on them. So not only are they bereft, but their doting parent has disappeared and been replaced by someone who yells at them.

**Key insight**: When a child says "I want a different mom," they are not testing. They are furious and do not know what to do with those feelings. Underneath the anger, they are heartbroken at the loss of parental love and respect.

## Developmental Context for Ages 3-4

**At age three**: Children are trying hard to master developmental tasks. Parents often crack down with too many rules and expectations. Three year olds desperately need their parents and want to please them. They are acutely sensitive to any lack of parental approval. They really cannot bear it when they think the parent is finding fault with them, which is why they might tell parents to shut up.

**Approaching four years old**: Children often hit a difficult stretch where they want more control and get angry when treated in what they feel is a less than respectful manner. Because they are already angry about the sibling situation, they are extra prone to fight and get into power struggles, but this developmental phase would likely cause some of this behavior anyway.

**Four year olds test limits**: If allowed to treat others disrespectfully, they will. This does not mean they will grow up to be axe-murderers, it means they are four and need adults to teach them how to manage their feelings responsibly.

**Critical developmental reality**: At this age, children are still developing impulse control and empathy for others. A preschooler does not actually have a lot of empathy for a baby sibling. They do not yet know how to appropriately handle their anger. This is why parental modeling of calmness matters so much.

## The Escalation Cycle and How to Break It

Every time a parent reacts in anger, the ugly cycle escalates. Every time a parent reacts with compassionate understanding, they send the message that maybe the child has not lost them after all.

**The core teaching for this age**: Feeling mad is just part of being human, but there is zero-tolerance for violent or disrespectful acts. Both parts of this message must be conveyed together.

## Strategy 1: Strengthen Connection

The child feels disconnected because they are angry at the parent, and because the parent is often naturally focused on the baby sibling. Building connection is foundational to all other strategies.

**Special time structure**: Spend dedicated one-on-one time with the child when the baby is not present. Call it "Special Time" using the child's name (the most special name there is). During this time, focus solely on the child: read to them, play whatever game they want, do lots of snuggling.

**Purpose of special time**: Reassure the child that they have not been ditched despite the new sibling, and build a strong relationship which will make them want to behave. The relationship is what motivates cooperation.

**Both parents needed**: The child also needs individual time with each parent, possibly on weekends.

## Strategy 2: Give Maximum Control

There is no reason to fight about clothing if the child picks their own clothes every day. Have only healthy food choices available, then let the child be in charge of what they eat as much as possible (though at dinner, obviously, a whole separate meal is not required).

**Critical point about toys**: Be sure there are plenty of toys that belong to the older child, that they can feel are in their control. These should not be available to the baby sibling without the older child's permission. The older child should not be forced to share these toys with the baby. The reasoning: The child has to share parents; they should at least be able to keep their toys for themselves.

## Strategy 3: Avoid Power Struggles

No one wins a power struggle. If the child is looking to lock horns, the parent's job is to sidestep. It takes two to have an argument.

**Specific tactics**:
- If the child disagrees, do not worry about having the last word
- Ask them to tell you more about why they think that
- Keep a light touch and a sense of humor
- Agree whenever possible
- If all else fails, give a hug

**Why forcing compliance backfires**: If you force the child to do something your way, they will become more defiant in other areas. You do not have to prove you are right. That will just make them feel worse about themselves, which will make them act worse. Let them save face.

**Reframe the situation**: It is okay for children to assert their preferences and express their feelings. This is not a challenge to parental authority. That is what any self-respecting person needs to do. The goal is setting necessary limits without getting into a power struggle.

### Parenting Aikido: A Specific Technique

**Parenting Aikido** means going with the child's need for control while still meeting the parent's need to keep things safe.

**How to remove yourself from the authority position**:
- Instead of "Because I said so," say "The rule is" and express empathy that you are sorry, you did not make the rule
- Wherever possible, make a chart showing what needs to be done (with pictures) so you are not barking orders
- Even when it is your rule (example: "At bedtime everyone brushes their teeth. See? Mommy does it too. That's the rule"), distancing yourself from being the source removes the child's need to rebel against you
- You become the empathizer instead of the heavy
- The child feels you are on their side, so they are more likely to cooperate rather than fight

## Strategy 4: Help the Child Grieve

The child is miserable and is defending against those feelings by directing rage at the sibling. **The best defense is a good offense.** Once they grieve and feel understood, they will not need to attack the sibling as much.

**Allow all feelings toward the sibling**: Make clear that feelings are given to us, like our arms and legs, so it is okay to have any feeling. But they are always responsible for what they do with their arms, legs, and feelings.

**Concrete example of this working**: One four year old said to his dad, "I just hate her, Dad. I don't know why." But because he was able to say it, he never hurt her. The ability to verbalize feelings reduces the need to act them out.

### Physical Expression of Feelings

The child's fear is so big, and they are so little, that they will do better expressing feelings with their body than with words.

**Specific prompts**:
- "Draw me a picture and show me how mad you are"
- "Can you bang on this drum and show me how mad you are?"

**Go past the anger**: Whenever possible, go past the anger to the feelings underneath: Fear that the parent might not love them anymore, sadness that things are different.

**Encourage crying**: Do not be surprised if the child needs to sob in your arms after being angry, or when you have read a book or discussed the baby. It is terrific if they can get through their anger to their sadness. Hold them while they cry.

## Strategy 5: Help the Child Understand Through Story

### The Family Story Approach

Tell the child a story about how it was just them and the parents, then the sibling was born and they were sad and angry, and how everything changed for them. End with how the parent always understood and was always there for them and they could tell the parent when they were upset, and how they would always be so special to the parent, because they are the only one of them in the world.

**Why this works**: One parent reported telling this story and the child was transfixed. The child asked for the story every day for several months. It helped them understand what they were feeling. It was also good snuggle time for just the two of them.

**Make it tangible**: Could make a little book. Something simple is fine. Glue photos on notebook paper and put the pages in a loose-leaf notebook.

### The Candle Demonstration for Understanding Love

This technique demonstrates that love does not get divided when shared.

**Process**:
1. Light a candle for the parent
2. Light a candle for the other parent from the first candle. Say you gave them all your love
3. Light a candle for the child from both parents' candles. Say you gave them all your love, but the other parent still has all your love because love is magic that way
4. Light the baby's candle. Again say how you gave them all your love, but the child and the other parent still have all your love because that is how love is

**Also recommended**: Read books about new babies from the big sibling's perspective.

## Strategy 6: Protect the Baby While Adjusting Discipline

**Constant supervision required**: Never leave the older child unsupervised with the baby. Little ones cannot be expected to control jealous emotions and the stakes are too high. A split lip is a warning.

### Prevention Through Distraction

Try to avoid admonishing the child. If you notice them getting rough, quickly move the baby away and distract with a question, song, or story.

### Response When Hitting Occurs

If the child actually hits or pushes the baby:
1. Remove the baby
2. Shower the baby with attention (If you focus attention on the aggressor, they will do it again to get attention, even negative attention)
3. Set the limit clearly: "I see you're mad. We don't hit. Use your words and tell me."

### Empathize and Offer Alternatives

Do not punish for hitting. Research shows punishment just makes the child feel worse and act worse.

**Instead**: Empathize with the feelings and offer another way of expressing them. Example: "I guess you were pretty mad that she had your toy. If you need help to protect your toys, call me and I will help you."

### Why Timeouts Make Things Worse

Timeouts make children feel worse about themselves and erode the parent-child relationship, which leads to more misbehavior.

**The specific dynamic with sibling jealousy**: Most children cannot cope with their complex emotions about a new baby, usually a combination of protectiveness and the desire to flush the baby down the toilet, and feel guilty. If they act out because of the pressure of tangled-up feelings, and parents react with timeouts, they are confirmed in their conclusion that they are a bad person for hating the baby. The situation then spirals down into further tantrumming and hitting.

**Core principle**: The only reason children behave is because of their connection with us. When we punish, they feel bad about themselves and misbehave more. The worse they behave, the more they need our love and compassion.

**Alternative**: Set limits, but stay connected while setting those limits by offering empathy. Connection is what keeps children cooperating.

### Why Yelling is Counterproductive

It is not necessary to yell so the child knows what they did is wrong. They know it is wrong; they just cannot help themselves in the press of all these hateful feelings.

**The impact of yelling**: It feels to the child like you do not love them anymore while you are yelling. In that case, their logic becomes: why not just beat the sibling up? The yelling removes the motivation to behave (maintaining the relationship) and confirms the child's fear that they have lost parental love.

## Strategy 7: Respond to Meltdowns with Empathy

When the child starts to lose it, empathize: "This is so hard for you, and you are feeling so bad right now. Let's go take some space until we feel better, ok?"

Then scoop them up lovingly. Sit with them.

**If they will let you hold them**: Great.

**If they are too angry to be held**: Say "I know you're really upset right now. Take however much time you need to calm down. I'm here if you need me."

**Critical warning**: Do not try to reason with them when they are upset. They are in no condition to hear you or be reasonable back.

**If the parent is too upset to stay calm**: Do not try to stay with the child. Be clear that the child is in charge of coming back to the embrace of the family whenever they are ready. Say: "I'm upset too, so I'm going to go calm down a bit. Whenever you're ready, come find me and let's give each other a big hug."

## Strategy 8: Allow Regression

This is not the time for asking the child to be a big kid. Expect regression. Let them be a baby as much as they want. Give lots of extra love and attention.

**Prioritize rules**: Pick a few really important rules to enforce and relax about things that do not matter as much, at least for now.

**The non-negotiable rules**:
- No hitting
- No hurting
- No bullying

Response to these is to set the limit, not to punish.

**Handling backtalk**: If they are mouthy, say: "Wow. That hurts my feelings. I don't speak to you like that and I don't like it when you speak to me like that. You must be pretty mad. Can you tell me about it?"

## Strategy 9: Ensure Adequate Sleep

Move bedtime half an hour earlier, or even an hour earlier, just to see if it makes a difference.

## Strategy 10: Build Emotional Intelligence

Consciously cultivate the child's emotional intelligence so they can learn to manage emotions.

**How**: Empathize with them, regardless of their feelings.

**Example phrases**:
- "It makes you mad when it doesn't work out the way you wanted"
- "You're pretty disappointed"
- "I know you feel sad right now"
- "You wish you didn't have to share with your sister"

## Strategy 11: Reinforce Their Role in the Family

Make sure the child knows they still have an important role in the family.

**What to say**: Note specific contributions rather than generic praise.
- "I love the way you help me like this"
- "I love the way you make me laugh"

Talk often about how each family member makes their own special contribution. The family needs each person for it to be whole.

## The Long-Term Goal

Give the child the message that all of them is acceptable, including their sad and angry feelings. That way they begin to learn that they cannot send the sibling back, and they cannot always get their way, but they get something even better: someone who loves all of them, no matter what.

This gradually forms the core of an unshakeable internal happiness that will allow them to handle whatever life throws at them, including eventually being a great big brother or sister.

## What NOT to Do

**Do not model might makes right**: Every time a parent gets angry and yells, or forces the child physically into a timeout, they are modeling that might makes right.

**Do not make the child give toys back while upset**: Making them return toys only upsets them more. Instead, help them understand sharing over time.

**Do not focus attention on the aggressor after hitting**: This rewards the behavior with attention (even negative attention).

**Do not try to reason during meltdowns**: They cannot hear you or be reasonable when upset.

**Do not expect the child to have empathy they have not yet developed**: They are still developing impulse control and empathy.

**Do not treat preference assertion as defiance**: Children asserting preferences and expressing feelings is what any self-respecting person needs to do, not a challenge to authority.
