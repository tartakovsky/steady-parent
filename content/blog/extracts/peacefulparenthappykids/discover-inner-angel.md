# Helping Children Experience the Joy of Giving

## Core Principle: Generosity Must Be Experienced, Not Taught

The central insight is that **children cannot learn generosity through lectures or forced sharing**. Research shows that kids become more generous when they experience how good it feels to be generous. The parent's job is to create opportunities for children to notice that feeling.

This works because of a neurobiological mechanism: all humans, including toddlers and preschoolers, get a little jolt of feel-good neurotransmitters when they willingly give to others. This likely exists because humans are social creatures and it helps the human race survive when we look after each other.

**The critical distinction: willing versus forced giving.** When we force children to share, no one likes giving something up under compulsion. The positive feeling only comes from voluntary giving. This is why we need to let children choose to share rather than make them share.

## Why This Matters Beyond Character Development

Teaching generosity isn't just about making children more generous people. It is also **better for their emotional health**. Children who feel they are making a positive difference in the world are more optimistic in general and feel more empowered to make a difference.

Research on thank-you notes specifically shows they make children happier - both at the time of writing them and even months later.

## The Problem: Commercial Holiday Culture

Many parents want their children to understand the values behind holidays, including generosity and sharing with those less fortunate. But instead, children often experience the holidays primarily as a time to create lists of material goods they covet.

Toy companies spend fortunes on TV advertising designed to induce cravings for more, more, more in children. Parents often feel helpless to manage their child's expectations. It is the parent's job to protect kids from this advertising assault and to teach them the deeper meaning of holidays.

## Framework: Creating Pleasurable Giving Experiences

The holiday season is the perfect time to create opportunities for giving that will be pleasurable for your child. The key is making giving enjoyable rather than obligatory.

### 1. Real-Time Generosity During Shopping

Buy an extra can of whatever you are purchasing and let your kids donate it at checkout (if your grocery store has such a program). This creates an immediate, tangible experience of giving.

For toy donations: Give your child a set amount to spend, take them to a toy store where they can pick out a gift for a needy child, and let them personally deliver it to a shelter, hospital, or charity drop-off point. The personal delivery matters because it connects the child to the impact of their giving.

### 2. The Pleasure of Making What You Give

Make ornaments or cookies as a family and let your child enjoy giving them away throughout the month without regard to whether you are receiving something in return. Wrapping gloves and mittens together to donate is another example.

The making process adds personal investment, and giving without expectation of reciprocity teaches pure generosity.

### 3. Thank-You Cards as Gratitude Practice

Have your child dictate thank-you cards to people whose presence enriches their life all year long while you write what they say. Then deliver them together or mail them.

These are not thank-you notes for gifts received, but proactive appreciation for ongoing relationships. They are heartwarming to recipients and research shows they make the children who write them happier - both immediately and months later.

### 4. Making and Delivering Food

Work together to make pies or cookies. Let your child help deliver the goodies to a local soup kitchen, home for the elderly, or to a firehouse where people are working on the holiday.

This combines the pleasure of creation with the direct experience of giving to people in need.

### 5. A Separate Charity Allowance

**Every child deserves the pleasure of giving their own money to a worthy cause.** Try giving a little extra weekly allowance that goes in a special "charity" jar. Let your child give it away every year at the holidays to the charity of their choice.

This creates ownership over the giving decision. The money is designated as the child's to give, so they experience full agency in the charitable act.

### 6. Santa's Workshop: Cleaning and Repairing to Donate

Go through the house together looking for anything you no longer use that could be cleaned or repaired and donated. Go through each child's room with them and create a "give-away" box of gently used items to pass on to kids who need them. Have a family session to clean and repair old toys and clothes and take them to donate.

**Critical warning: Do not force kids to give things away before they are ready "because others are needy."** Giving should not be painful, or it will backfire. This directly contradicts a common parenting instinct to use need as leverage. The backfire effect undermines the entire goal of developing genuine generosity.

### 7. Family Charity Night

You could call it something with more resonance for your kids, like "Gift for the World Night" or "Tzedakah Night" (the Jewish equivalent that means restoring justice).

**Process:**
1. Let your kids make a "Wish List" of all the ways they would like to make the world a better place
2. Then let each person in the family choose one thing to do to address one of those issues

**Examples of actions:**
- Make a donation to Heifer International
- Plan to volunteer at your local Meals on Wheels delivering food
- Make a commitment to reduce your carbon emissions by walking more instead of driving

The wish list approach lets children envision global change, then the individual action selection gives each family member ownership over their specific contribution.

### 8. Volunteering as a Family

The author's children volunteered for years at a local soup kitchen, and the kids loved feeling they made a difference. It also helped when they saw a homeless person - they could know that person could go get a hot meal at "our" soup kitchen.

This shows how direct service creates lasting mental connections. The homeless person is no longer abstract; they are connected to a place where the child has personally served.

**Volunteer options:**
- Organize a book drive and ship books to Reader to Reader
- Gather used coats to donate
- Stuff stockings to donate to a family shelter
- Sort food at a food bank
- Help deliver Meals on Wheels
- Become Kindness Elves doing random acts of kindness for others

### 9. Connect Giving to Tradition and Faith

Use dinner table time during December to discuss what your winter holiday means to you.

**Examples by tradition:**
- **Celebrating the birth of Christ** gives ample opportunity to talk about love and good deeds
- **Yule or Winter Solstice** is about celebrating the return of the light, which can extend to joyful giving
- **Hanukka** is about rededicating ourselves to the miracle of faith, which unites us as a community

The key question to explore: Why do we share with others less fortunate?

**Long-term impact:** Having these discussions as your children grow up makes it more likely that as they enter their teen years, they will live your values and find worthy causes of their own. The values become internalized through repeated discussion over years.

### 10. Playing Santa Through USPS Letters

Every year the US Post Office receives millions of letters from children with requests like: "Mommy doesn't have enough money for Christmas this year... can you send us food and blankets and a backpack for school for my little sister?"

You and your child can serve as elves through this program, directly responding to real children's needs.

### 11. Daily Kindness Traditions

Instead of the Elf on the Shelf watching your child's every move, **Kindness Elves** are a fun alternative - and you can make them instead of buying them. But you do not need an "elf" to start a December tradition of random acts of kindness.

**Simple approach:** Tell your child that everyone in your family is a kindness elf this month. Brainstorm a list of random acts of kindness and choose one to do every day or so, or plan them in advance on your calendar.

## Model Example: George Clooney's Family Tradition

George Clooney describes his childhood experience: "On Christmas morning, before we could open our Christmas presents, we would go to this stranger's home and bring them presents. I remember helping clean the house up and putting up a tree. My father believed that you have a responsibility to look after everyone else."

This illustrates several principles:
- The giving came before personal receiving (establishing priority)
- It was hands-on service, not just dropping off gifts
- It was framed as responsibility, not optional kindness
- The tradition was consistent, creating lasting impact

## Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Do not lecture about values.** Research shows this does not work. Children must experience generosity to internalize it.

**Do not force sharing.** Compelled giving does not produce the neurological reward that creates genuine generosity. It may actually create negative associations with giving.

**Do not use guilt or need as leverage.** Telling children they should give things away "because others are needy" before the child is ready makes giving painful. Painful giving backfires and undermines the development of genuine generosity.

**Do not focus only on receiving.** The commercial holiday culture emphasizes wish lists and getting. Parents must actively create counterbalancing experiences of giving.
