## What EFT Is and How It Works

**Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)**, also called "tapping," combines three elements: energy meridians from traditional acupressure, conscious breathing, and verbal mantras. The technique involves tapping acupressure points with your fingertips while breathing deeply and delivering verbal messages to your subconscious.

### The Mechanism Behind EFT's Effectiveness

The technique works through a conditioning process: over time, the physical act of tapping becomes associated with the calm state produced by conscious deep breathing. This association means EFT becomes increasingly effective with repeated use, functioning like any other mindfulness practice where the practice itself strengthens the response.

### Research Status

Research has shown that EFT effectively calms the nervous system, and studies indicate that tapping the acupressure points is an essential component (not just the breathing or mantras alone). According to Feinstein (2012), EFT "has met APA standards as an efficacious treatment for a number of conditions, including anxiety, depression, phobias, and PTSD."

Some researchers question these studies and even challenge whether the energy meridians accepted in traditional Chinese medicine can be substantiated. More research is needed to validate EFT as a clinical treatment. However, the practical argument is compelling: there are no side effects, it costs nothing, it's simple, and takes almost no time. If it doesn't work for you, there's no loss in trying.

## Three Ways to Use EFT

### 1. Releasing Negative Emotions and Calming Yourself

Simply tap the acupressure points while breathing deeply and noticing any physical sensations or shifts in your body. You may find yourself yawning, which is one of the body's ways of releasing emotions.

### 2. Making Affirmations More Effective

Combine tapping with positive affirmations such as:
- "I am more than enough."
- "Every day I am more patient/grateful/happier."

### 3. Reprogramming the Subconscious

Because the subconscious is deeply linked to the body, EFT can be used to shift beliefs. The formula involves acknowledging what you're currently feeling while inviting the possibility that something else could also be true:

- "Even though I'm feeling anxious about [specific situation], I know I can handle whatever happens."
- "Even though I'm feeling sad right now, I deeply love, accept and forgive myself."

This "even though... I..." structure is key: it validates the current emotional state while introducing a new perspective, rather than denying or suppressing the feeling.

## Using EFT with Children

### Applications for Kids

Once you've experienced EFT's effectiveness for managing your own moods, you can extend it to children for:
- Calming them when they're upset
- Helping them release stuck emotions or trauma
- Helping them relax to fall asleep at night
- Reframing situations more positively (example: "Even though I'm feeling scared, I know that I am safe.")

### Two Approaches for Children

1. **Tap directly on your child** - You may want to demonstrate first on yourself or on a teddy bear before tapping on the child
2. **Teach them to tap on themselves** - Empowers them to use the technique independently

## The Tapping Points and Technique

### How to Tap

Firmly but gently tap either side of the body using your fingertips. Tap long enough to take three complete breaths in and out at each point. You can also massage these points instead of tapping. Breathe deeply throughout, and you can add verbal statements as described above.

### The Tapping Points in Sequence

1. **Karate Chop area** - Outside edge of hand, below the little finger
2. **Eyebrow** - Either eyebrow, tap on the end near the bridge of the nose
3. **Under the Eye** - About 1 inch below either eye, on the bone
4. **Under the Nose** - Above the upper lip
5. **Chin** - Below the lower lip, in the crease where the chin starts
6. **Beginning of Collar Bone** - Inside end of either collarbone, on the end below the throat
7. **Four inches under Armpit** - Side of the rib cage
8. **Side of Little Finger** - Side near ring finger, at the base of the nail
9. **Inside of Wrist** - The pulse point area where many people fasten their watch band
10. **Crown of Head** - Rest an open hand palm-down on the crown
11. **Tender Spot, Left Side of Chest** - Located beneath the collarbone and above the breast area on the left side. Find it by pressing with one or two fingers around this area until you locate a spot more tender than the surrounding area. Rub this spot in a small circle rather than tapping.

### Important Flexibility in Practice

**You don't need to be exact.** Tapping the general area will get the job done.

**You don't need to do all the points.** Many people just use the "karate chop" point alone, which is often enough to help lessen anxiety.

**You don't need to follow a specific order.**

**The minimal effective dose:** Just tapping the karate chop point is frequently sufficient for reducing anxiety.

## Practical Considerations

### Physical Signs of Release

Yawning during EFT is an indication that your body is releasing stress. Don't be surprised if this happens - it's a positive sign.

### Items to Remove Before Tapping

Practitioners recommend removing glasses, watches, or bracelets before beginning because they can be electromagnetically obstructive to the process.

## The Foundation: Deep Breathing and Mantras

The article situates EFT within a broader context of calming techniques. Research shows that deep breathing is highly effective for calming the body and shifting emotional states. Most people find it helpful to add **mantras** - phrases that serve as an antidote to thoughts or beliefs that don't serve you. EFT anchors this breathing practice and speaks directly to the subconscious through the combination of physical sensation (tapping), breathing, and verbal affirmation.
