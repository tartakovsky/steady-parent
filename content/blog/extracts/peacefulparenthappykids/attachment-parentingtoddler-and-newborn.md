# Repairing Attachment with a Toddler After a New Baby Arrives

## Core Principle: There Is Never a Point of No Return

**Attachment relationships can always be repaired and made even stronger.** The foundation for repair consists of two elements: (1) awareness of what is happening in the relationship and (2) intention to make things better. If a parent has both of these, repair is possible regardless of how much rupture has occurred.

## Understanding Ambivalent Attachment Behavior

When a toddler shows **ambivalent attachment** behavior - protesting a parent's departure, then rejecting comfort upon return - this is a symptom of underlying fears, not evidence that the relationship is broken. The child's rejection upon the parent's return is not caused by the separation itself (even regular weekly separations of a few hours are fine) but rather by the child's accumulated insecurity and fear that the parent won't return or won't be emotionally available.

**Key insight:** The ambivalent behavior will go away as the child begins to feel more secure again. Regular short separations (like 3 hours once a week) are healthy for parental sanity and do not cause the ambivalent attachment pattern - the underlying insecurity does.

## Context: Why Attachment Can Weaken During Pregnancy and After a New Baby

Several factors can create distance in the parent-child relationship:

1. **Physical exhaustion during pregnancy** - especially in the third trimester, physical limitations reduce the parent's capacity for engagement
2. **Emotional withdrawal** - homesickness, depression, or overwhelm can cause a parent to pull back emotionally
3. **Transfer of caregiving** - when primary caregiving shifts to a helper or other parent due to these limitations
4. **Constant presence of the new baby** - the toddler loses undivided attention and must now share the parent

If withdrawal during a difficult pregnancy created the rift, and the constant presence of the new baby compounds it, then the solution must directly address the relationship itself.

## The Role of Multiple Attachment Figures

**It is good for children to have more than one attachment relationship.** Having a secure relationship with a caregiver, father, or other trusted adult does not compromise the security of the child's relationship with the primary parent. These additional attachment figures extend the parent's ability to be the mother or father they want to be.

**Reframe:** Think of a trusted caregiver as an adopted aunt or grandmother. Welcome this person emotionally into your heart and your child's heart. Making peace with the caregiver's role is important - the parent's discomfort or resentment about the helper's closeness with the child can interfere with repair.

**Why this matters for the parent:** When a child asks to play with or be with the helper instead of the parent, this is typically because the helper offers undivided attention while the parent's attention is divided by the baby. This hurts, but understanding the reason helps the parent not take it as rejection of the relationship itself.

## Primary Strategy: Protected Daily One-on-One Time

**Find a particular time, on a daily basis, that is protected time between you and the toddler.** During this time, the toddler knows the parent will always be there, while the baby naps or is otherwise occupied with the caregiver.

**Timing options:**
- Bedtime routine
- Bathtime
- After school pickup
- Any consistent, predictable slot

**What to do during this time:**
- Be fully present with the child
- Offer physical connection (cuddles, closeness)
- Offer verbal connection (talking, singing, playing)
- Offer emotional connection (attunement, responsiveness)
- Explicitly name it: "This is special time for just the two of us, every day"

**Why this works:** The predictability and exclusivity of this time rebuilds the child's sense that the parent is reliably available. The child needs to experience, repeatedly, that there is a protected space in the parent's life that belongs to the relationship.

## The Departure and Return Protocol

**Consistency is essential.** Always use the same routine when leaving. The predictability of the routine builds trust that the pattern will complete - if goodbye happens a certain way, return will follow.

### At Departure

When the child protests leaving:
- Acknowledge the feeling: "You don't want me to go"
- Provide reassurance about care: "Your caregiver will take care of you"
- State the return explicitly: "I will be back soon"
- Use a consistent, memorable phrase: **"Mommy ALWAYS comes back"**

**Why the phrase matters:** Young toddlers don't have the cognitive ability to fully understand time or predict the future. A simple, repeated phrase becomes an anchor they can hold onto. The word "always" is important - it creates a rule the child can rely on.

### At Return (When Child Rejects Comfort)

When the child rejects the parent upon return:
1. Stay near the child without forcing contact
2. State what happened: "Mommy came back"
3. Repeat the rule: "Mommy ALWAYS comes back"
4. Name the child's feelings: "You're still mad and sad that Mommy left"
5. Acknowledge readiness: "So you aren't ready to hug Mommy yet"
6. Offer availability: "Whenever you're ready, I will be here to hug you"

**Why not force contact:** The child needs to process the feelings of fear and anger at being left. Forcing a hug would invalidate those feelings. Staying present while the child works through the emotions demonstrates that the parent can tolerate the child's negative feelings without withdrawing - which is precisely what the child fears.

## The Power of Empathy and Verbal Recognition

**Offer empathy for what the child is going through, and verbal recognition of their feelings.** Since toddlers don't have the language yet to express their feelings, the parent must:

1. Use simple language
2. Repeat themselves frequently
3. Name the emotions the child is likely experiencing

**The mechanism:** When a child feels understood, that understanding itself repairs the rupture. The child doesn't just need the parent to return - they need the parent to recognize and accept their feelings about the leaving and returning. This is what makes the child feel truly seen and secure.

**Persistence is required:** This is not a one-time intervention. The parent must persist with empathy and verbal recognition over time. Gradually, the child will begin to feel understood, and the security will rebuild.

## The Toddler's Perspective on Divided Attention

When the parent is always with both the toddler and the baby, the toddler is getting shared attention. When the helper is with the toddler, the toddler gets undivided attention. This is why the toddler may prefer the helper for play - it's not a rejection of the parent, it's a preference for focused engagement.

**What this means:** The solution isn't to feel hurt or competitive with the helper. The solution is to create times of undivided attention with the parent (the protected daily time) so the toddler gets both - the helper for some undivided attention, and the parent for protected exclusive time.

## Adjustment Period Is Normal

**There is always an adjustment period when a new baby is born.** The toddler does feel the real pain of losing undivided attention. This loss is genuine and should not be minimized. However, the toddler is also gaining a sibling, which will ultimately enrich their life.

**The difficulty is temporary:** It feels hard to be there for both children, but this evolves over time. Parents eventually find they have enough love and energy to go around. Having partners in parenting (spouse, caregiver) helps bridge this difficult period.

## Instinct vs. External Advice

**Context from the letter:** The mother's instinct was to personally do school drop-off and goodbye with her toddler. Teachers suggested letting the helper do it, arguing it might be easier for the child. The mother tried it for two weeks against her instincts, but saw no improvement. When she took over the drop-off herself, the child started doing much better within a week.

**Why the mother's instinct was right:** The child needed to experience that the parent always says goodbye and always returns. This builds the predictable pattern the child needs for security. Having the helper do drop-off broke the direct parent-child goodbye/return cycle.

**Lesson:** External advice (even from teachers) may not account for attachment dynamics. A parent's instinct about what their specific child needs, especially regarding attachment, often proves correct.

## What Regular Separation Looks Like When Healthy

Leaving the child with a trusted caregiver once a week for about three hours is described as important for the parent's own sanity and completely acceptable. The ambivalent behavior is not caused by these separations - it's caused by underlying insecurity. As security rebuilds, the child will be able to tolerate these separations without the protest-reject pattern.

## Summary of the Repair Framework

1. **Acknowledge** that repair is always possible if you have awareness and intention
2. **Make peace** with other attachment figures in the child's life - they help, not hurt
3. **Create protected daily one-on-one time** with the toddler while the baby is cared for by someone else
4. **Use a consistent departure routine** with a memorable phrase ("Mommy ALWAYS comes back")
5. **When rejected at return**, stay present, name feelings, don't force contact, express availability
6. **Persist with empathy and verbal recognition** - the child feeling understood is what repairs the rupture
7. **Trust your instincts** about what your specific child needs for attachment security
