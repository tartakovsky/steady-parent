# Becoming a Recovering Perfectionist: Self-Forgiveness in Parenting

Source: https://www.peacefulparenthappykids.com/read/How-to-forgive-yourself

## Core Principle: Perfectionism Undermines Unconditional Love

The central insight is that pursuing perfection as a parent actually prevents you from loving your child unconditionally. This happens because perfectionism stops you from loving yourself unconditionally first. The logic flows like this: if you are harsh with yourself, you cannot be emotionally generous with your child. **Self-compassion is the prerequisite for compassion toward others**.

The quote from Heather Forbes captures this perfectly: **"Perfection is the lowest standard any human can have."** Perfectionism isn't a high standard - it's actually a self-defeating trap that blocks the real goal: expanding your heart and creating more love.

## The Self-Love Foundation

### Dropping the "Not Good Enough" List

Everyone carries an internal list of ways they need to be different before they're acceptable: be more together, thinner, nicer, a better parent. This internal checklist creates a conditional relationship with yourself - you'll only accept yourself after you meet certain criteria.

**The healing move**: Love yourself exactly as you are, with no conditions, "faults" and all. This doesn't mean ignoring areas for growth. Rather, it reframes faults as opportunities to grow - not by making yourself more perfect, but by loving yourself more. The path to improvement runs through self-acceptance, not self-rejection.

### Every Choice Is Between Love and Fear

Life presents constant choice points. Should you be harsh with your child because you fear they won't learn otherwise? Should you prove you were right to your partner? Should you stop cleaning to have a pillow fight with your kid?

**At their core, every one of these choices is between love and fear**. The practice is to choose love as often as possible.

Importantly, past mistakes don't define you because **you get new opportunities every single day to turn your love ratio around**. No one can change the past, but anyone can start today to create a new future. Your life is the sum of your choices, and you're always making new ones.

## Understanding the Fear Mechanism

### The Mind's Negative Chatter

If you recorded your internal dialogue, you'd hear a constant stream of self-criticism suggesting you should be perfect:
- "That was dumb..."
- "What an idiot I am..."
- "If only I were a better mother/father..."
- "What have I done wrong that she's acting like this..."
- "Have I damaged him for life?"
- "I should have known better..."

### Why Our Minds Do This

These critical thoughts run on **old belief systems formed in childhood** that we decided might keep us safe. The mind worries constantly and finds fault with everything as a survival strategy - it thinks this will keep us striving to make things better.

**The trap**: Whenever we buy into these belief systems that we aren't good enough and are making a mess of things, we reinforce fear. Fear is the opposite of love. So the critical thoughts that seem like they're helping us improve are actually preventing us from accessing love.

## The Heart Shift Technique

### Why Shifting to the Heart Works

The only way to break the vicious cycle of negative thoughts is to shift out of them and into the heart. The heart operates differently from the thinking mind:
- The heart can't be negative
- It functions at a higher level
- It's oriented toward connection and growth
- It can only be compassionate

### The Stop, Drop, and Breathe Method

When you notice a negative thought about yourself:

1. **Stop** - Catch yourself in the negative thought
2. **Drop** - Release the thought
3. **Breathe** - Take a deep breath

The deep breath unplugs you from the tape loop in your thoughts. This creates space for choice.

4. **Put your hand on your heart and breathe love into it**
5. **Use a mantra** if helpful: "I am more than enough, exactly as I am."
6. **Consciously choose to feel love**

Research shows this process has physical, mental, and emotional benefits that increase the more often you practice it. Your whole sense of well-being shifts with regular practice.

## Transforming the Inner Critic

### Becoming Your Own Fairy Godmother

The inner critic can be transformed into an inner supporter. Anne Lamott's guidance: **"Take yourself through the day as you would your most beloved mental-patient relative, with great humor and lots of small treats."**

### Replacing Catastrophizing with Reassurance

Every time you notice self-criticism, remind yourself: the goal isn't perfection - the goal is loving yourself and others.

When your mind starts catastrophizing, redirect with supportive self-talk:
- "Nobody bats 1000..."
- "You can handle this..."
- "Easy does it..."
- "This too shall pass..."
- "Two steps forward, one step back still gets me where I want to go..."
- "I am more than enough..."
- "My child is getting better parenting than I got, LOL; he will be ok..."
- "I don't have to know what to do, I just have to love him through it..."
- "I can trust my instincts..."
- "Love never fails."

## The Practice of Self-Forgiveness

### Why Forgiveness Matters

You made a mistake not because you stopped striving for perfection - you made it because you're human. Everyone makes mistakes, all the time. Really.

Can you still have a happy, responsible, fabulous life and be a good parent despite mistakes? Yes. **The key is forgiving yourself so you can accept your imperfections graciously**. This acceptance makes it easier to:
- Admit when you mess up
- Make amends
- Move forward constructively

You cannot be compassionate to your child while beating yourself up inside. Forgiveness frees up emotional energy for connection.

### Making Reparations

If you're mature enough to see you made a mistake and created a problem, you're already being a terrific role model. The focus should be on solving the problem you've created, not on blame and guilt.

As long as you can forgive yourself, you'll find ways to repair rifts with your child that actually strengthen the relationship. **Your child will survive your mistakes**. In fact, when you:
- Acknowledge you messed up
- Apologize
- Work to repair the relationship

...your child learns some of the most important lessons in life about accountability, humility, and repair.

## Why Imperfection Is Actually Good Parenting

### The Logic Against Perfect Parents

Your child will never be perfect because they're human. So having a perfect parent would be a terrible role model. Here's why:

1. If your child sees you as perfect, they'll feel worse about themselves - they know they're not perfect
2. If your child sees you as imperfect but unwilling to admit it, you're modeling denial and inauthenticity

What your child actually needs is a role model for how to graciously acknowledge when you miss the mark, apologize, and make amends.

**Give up on perfection. Forgive yourself for being human. APPLAUD yourself for being human** and appreciate the amazing opportunity to live as a human trying to make the world better.

Mistakes aren't actually mistakes if you:
- Grow from them
- Repair any problems they create

They're opportunities to love more, starting with yourself.

## Self-Appreciation as an Antidote to Shame

### How Appreciation Works

Appreciation and gratitude interrupt negative thoughts and give you access to more love. When you notice self-criticism, change gears and find something to appreciate about yourself.

### The "Even Though..." Technique

If you can't find anything to appreciate, use the **"Even though..."** framing to bridge from self-criticism to self-acceptance:

- "Even though I sometimes get annoyed at myself, I deeply love and accept myself..."
- "Even though I sometimes lose my temper, more and more I am patient with my child..."
- "Even though I make mistakes, I am good enough just the way I am..."
- "Even though I don't always know what to do, I keep listening to my inner wisdom so I can hear it better..."
- "Even though I get scared and tired sometimes, I love my body's strength and energy..."
- "Even though I'm tired at the end of the day, I'm so grateful I have my kids, my home, my health, a bed to sleep in, and a fresh start tomorrow."

This technique acknowledges the difficulty while affirming self-acceptance and growth.

## The Ho'oponopono Forgiveness Practice

### The Prayer

The Hawaiian Ho'oponopono prayer offers a simple forgiveness practice:

**"I'm sorry... Please forgive me... I love you... I thank you."**

### How to Use It

- Repeat to yourself for self-forgiveness, even without knowing what specifically you're asking forgiveness for
- Speak it (in your mind) to anyone in your past or present who comes to mind
- You don't have to think about what's being forgiven - just forgive it all
- View it as repairing any damage
- A few minutes daily is very powerful

### Important Clarification

This practice can melt away resentments and conflicts. However, **choosing to do this practice does NOT mean you need to have someone who hurt you in your life**. It means you let go of the pain so you are more peaceful in your heart. As you gain in self-love, you become more able to be clear about healthy boundaries.

The practice is about your internal state, not about reconciling with harmful people.

## The Ultimate Reframe: Nothing to Forgive

### Beyond Forgiveness

Here's the deepest insight: you aren't perfect. You never will be. You're human. But the goal was never perfection. **The goal is expanding your heart and creating more love in the world**.

If you fill yourself with love, it will automatically overflow to everyone around you.

### The Invitation

- Nurture yourself with infinite tenderness
- Let your heart stretch past its boundaries
- There is nothing you need to change or do to deserve love
- **You're already more than enough, just the way you are**

## The Daily Practice

This isn't a one-time insight but a daily practice. Repeat these principles daily and notice:
- You're healing your ability to love unconditionally
- Your life transforms
