# Navigating Diagnosis and Medication Decisions for High-Maintenance Children

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids - Dr. Laura Markham

## The Core Challenge

When a child exhibits challenging behaviors, particularly a "high-maintenance" child who has always been difficult, the situation often intensifies when they enter school. Behaviors that were manageable at home become more visible and problematic in a structured environment. This creates pressure from multiple directions: school complaints, home struggles, and the urgent desire to find answers and help.

## Understanding the Diagnostic Landscape

### The Problem with Quick Diagnoses

**Family doctors should not diagnose mental disorders.** Their appropriate role is to refer to specialists for consultation. When a family doctor diagnoses conditions like ADHD based solely on parent descriptions and "symptoms," this bypasses the thorough evaluation process that complex behavioral presentations require. The case study demonstrates how an initial ADHD diagnosis led to medication trials that produced severe adverse reactions, including extreme anger and aggression on Strattera, and emergency room visits due to facial tics, repetitive actions, and elevated heart rate on Concerta.

### The Psychiatrist-Psychologist Divide

There is a fundamental **training bias** that affects how mental health professionals approach behavioral challenges:

**Psychiatrists** receive extensive medical training but often less psychological training. This orientation can lead them to see problems primarily through a medical/pharmaceutical lens. In the case study, the psychiatrist's response to medication failures was to conclude early-onset bipolar disorder rather than stepping back to question whether medication was appropriate at all.

**Psychologists** receive extensive psychological training but no medical training. This can lead to seeing everything as environmental. The case study shows how one psychologist attributed all problems to parenting skills, dismissing any possibility of the child having inherent challenges.

Neither extreme represents the full picture. The reality is that behavioral challenges typically involve both innate characteristics and environmental factors working together.

## The Nature vs. Nurture Reality

### Rejecting the False Binary

The claim that a child's difficulties are "all your parenting" is highly unlikely to be accurate. Dr. Markham emphasizes that **every child is different, and half of who any child is can be traced directly to his genes.** Some children simply have more challenges than others, and this is not the parents' fault.

At the same time, how you parent a difficult child makes a significant difference in outcomes. Both things are true simultaneously: the child has inherent challenges, AND parenting approach matters in how those challenges develop or resolve.

### The Critical Period for Intervention

This combination of innate challenges and environmental response creates what Dr. Markham calls a "critical period for intervention." Parents only get one chance to raise their child, and without proper support and guidance, they are "winging it in a very challenging situation." The stakes are high because early intervention during this developmental window can shape the trajectory of the child's adjustment to school and home life.

## Finding the Right Professional Support

### What to Look For

The recommendation is to find **a good counselor with lots of experience with kids like your son.** Dr. Markham notes there are "lots of kids like him," normalizing the experience and suggesting that experienced practitioners have developed effective approaches through working with similar cases. An experienced therapist will know what will best help both the child and the parents.

### The Parent-Child-Therapist Triangle

Effective treatment involves multiple configurations:

- Parents seeing the counselor together to develop parenting behaviors that support positive adjustment
- Child sometimes seeing the counselor by himself
- Parents sometimes seeing the counselor without the child

This multi-pronged approach recognizes that both the child's internal experience and the parent-child dynamic need attention.

## Approaching Medication Thoughtfully

### Proceed with Extreme Caution

When a child has had bad reactions to both Strattera and Concerta (the two main types of ADD/ADHD medications), this strongly suggests **proceeding very carefully with any medication at all.** These adverse reactions are signals that the child's system may not tolerate these pharmaceutical interventions well.

### The Diagnosis-Medication Link

Any medication should be **directly related to a diagnosis.** This means a thorough evaluation must come before medication decisions. The sequence matters: first get an accurate diagnosis, then determine whether medication is indicated for that specific condition.

### Medication Is Not a Panacea

Dr. Markham offers several important cautions about medication:

**Ritalin (and Concerta, which is sustained-release Ritalin) is very over-prescribed.** The cultural tendency to medicate behavioral challenges has created an over-reliance on pharmaceutical solutions.

**Many kids improve with excellent coaching/therapy/parenting/teaching alone.** This demonstrates that medication is not the only path to improvement, and for many children it may not be the best or necessary path.

**Medication comes with its own problems.** Even when it helps with target symptoms, there are trade-offs and side effects that must be weighed against benefits.

**The child may do best without any medication.** This possibility should remain on the table rather than assuming medication is inevitable.

## Getting a Proper Evaluation

### Age-Appropriate Diagnostic Considerations

**Six years old is very early to diagnose bipolar disorder.** Reputable clinics would proceed very carefully with such a diagnosis at this age. The early-onset bipolar diagnosis in the case study came after medication failures rather than through proper evaluation, which is a concerning diagnostic process.

**PDD (Pervasive Developmental Disorder) can be definitively diagnosed at age 6** based on specific cognitive, motor, social, and language delays. A good evaluator can either rule out PDD or confirm it.

### Where to Go for Evaluation

The recommendation is to seek evaluation at **good clinics associated with universities and hospitals that specialize in mental health evaluations of children.** These institutions typically have:

- Rigorous evaluation protocols
- Experience with complex cases
- Access to specialists across disciplines
- Built-in referral networks to therapists on staff who work with similar issues

This last point is particularly valuable: by finding a good evaluation clinic, parents often also find the ongoing therapist they need, creating continuity of care.

### The Evaluation-Before-Medication Principle

**A thorough evaluation is in order before more medication is prescribed.** This reverses the common pattern where medication is tried based on symptom presentation, and diagnosis is inferred from medication response (or lack thereof). The proper sequence is: evaluate thoroughly first, diagnose accurately, then consider whether medication is indicated for that specific diagnosis.

## Anti-Patterns and What to Avoid

**Don't accept a diagnosis from a family doctor for mental/behavioral conditions.** This is outside their specialty, and the case study shows how it led to inappropriate medication trials.

**Don't accept an "all parenting" dismissal.** This ignores the genetic and temperamental factors that contribute to a child's challenges.

**Don't conclude diagnosis from medication response.** The reasoning "if he reacted badly to ADHD meds, he must be bipolar" is backwards. Medication response is not a diagnostic tool.

**Don't try to handle a challenging situation alone without professional guidance.** The complexity of these cases requires experienced help.

**Don't give up on finding good professional support.** Multiple disappointing experiences with practitioners doesn't mean good help doesn't exist.

## The Broader Perspective

The case study represents a common pattern: parents seeking help, receiving conflicting opinions, experiencing medication failures, and feeling increasingly lost. The path forward involves:

1. Getting a proper evaluation at a reputable institution before any more medication trials
2. Finding an experienced therapist to work with both parents and child
3. Developing parenting approaches that support the child's specific needs
4. Considering medication only after accurate diagnosis and only as directly indicated
5. Recognizing that both the child's inherent characteristics and parenting approach matter

The goal is not to find a quick fix but to understand the child's actual challenges and develop a comprehensive approach that addresses both the child's needs and the family system.
