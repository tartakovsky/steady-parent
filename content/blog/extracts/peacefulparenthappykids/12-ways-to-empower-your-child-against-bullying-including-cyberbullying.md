# Empowering Children Against Bullying (Including Cyberbullying)

## Defining Bullying: What It Is and What It Is Not

**Bullying** is defined as repeated, unwanted, aggressive behavior involving a real or perceived power imbalance. A child or teen uses that power - whether physical strength, access to embarrassing information, or popularity - to control or harm others.

Bullying takes many forms: spreading rumors, name-calling, exclusion, threats, and physical aggression. The key distinction is that bullying is **intentional, repeated abuse of power** aimed at causing harm. It is not the same as a one-time conflict, hurtful comment, or ordinary teasing. All children will sometimes be teased or feel left out, but true bullying has three elements: it is intentional, it is repeated, and it involves a power imbalance.

## Why Children Bully: The Psychology of Power-Seeking

Children bully because it gives them power. Every human needs to feel powerful in their lives. When children don't have access to healthy sources of power - such as autonomy, mastery, and connection - they may seek power in unhealthy ways. If a child feels powerless or emotionally overwhelmed, bullying can feel like a way to gain control.

**Many children who bully are themselves hurting.** They have often been humiliated, threatened, or mistreated, and they displace those feelings onto someone else. This creates a cycle: kids who are hurting often hurt other kids.

## Can You Bully-Proof Your Child?

No, you cannot completely bully-proof your child. There will always be people who are hurting and lash out, and your child's path will sometimes cross with theirs. All children will encounter peers who misuse power at some point. It is also developmentally normal for kids to experiment with power dynamics, especially before they have fully developed empathy.

**The goal is not to shield your child from every instance of unkindness, but to help them develop the skills to respond with confidence and to reach out when they need help.**

## The Systemic Nature of Bullying

Bullying can begin as early as preschool and often intensifies in middle school. Research shows that **40% to 80% of middle schoolers** admit to participating in bullying at some point. Many describe themselves as both victims and aggressors. This tells us something important: bullying is often systemic, not just individual. Our culture bears some responsibility for the pervasiveness of bullying.

### Why Punishment Does Not Work

Research shows that punishment is ineffective at reducing bullying. What actually works:
- Restorative justice circles
- Conflict resolution training
- Transforming the culture of a school

These approaches have been proven more effective than targeting bullies with punishment. Unfortunately, many schools are still struggling to implement effective approaches, and the situation is getting worse in many communities.

## The Added Danger of Cyberbullying

With social media, bullying can follow children home, eroding their sense of safety even in their own bedrooms. Tragically, rising rates of anxiety, depression, and even suicide have been linked to cyberbullying.

**Long-term consequences of bullying** include higher risk for:
- Depression
- Anxiety
- PTSD
- Substance abuse
- Self-destructive behavior

## The 12 Strategies to Empower Your Child

### 1. Model Compassionate, Respectful Relationships From the Start

Children learn how relationships work by watching how parents treat them and others. There are two pathways created by parental modeling:

**If you use power over your child**, they learn one of two things:
1. To use power over others (becoming a potential bully)
2. To allow others to use power over them (becoming a potential target)

**Physical punishment is particularly harmful.** Research has repeatedly established that physically disciplining a child is associated with more bullying behaviors. If you spank, your child learns that physical violence is the way to respond to interpersonal problems.

More broadly, any discipline methods that use power over a child teach them either to use power over others or to let others use power over them. Children often perceive punishment as adults using force to get their way, which teaches them that bullying is acceptable.

**The alternative:** Model respectful communication and set limits with empathy. This teaches children that relationships don't require domination or submission, and that they deserve to be treated with dignity.

As Alice Miller wrote in "Thou Shalt Not Be Aware": "If children have been accustomed from the start to having their world respected, they will have no trouble later in life recognizing disrespect... and will rebel against it on their own."

### 2. Stay Connected to Your Child Through Thick and Thin

**Lonely kids are more likely to be bullied.** Additionally, kids are often ashamed that they're being bullied, so they are hesitant to tell their parents. Connection is the foundation that makes children more likely to tell you if they are being bullied.

The concept of **connection as the 80/20 rule**: Connection is the 80% that makes the other 20% of guidance stick. When your child feels seen and supported, two things happen:
1. They are more likely to talk to you about problems
2. They are more likely to believe in their own self-worth

**The key question:** How do you make sure your child would tell you if they were being bullied? The answer is consistent connection - making sure your child knows you will always listen and that you have their back.

### 3. Model Confident, Respectful Assertiveness With Others

Children learn assertiveness patterns by watching their parents. There are two problematic patterns to avoid:

**The aggressive pattern:** Losing your temper and cursing out other drivers (even from the privacy of your own car) teaches your child that sometimes it's okay to disrespect other people.

**The passive pattern:** Backing down easily to avoid making a scene, then seething silently later, teaches those avoidance and suppression strategies.

**What healthy assertiveness looks like:** Calm, clear, respectful communication - even when you disagree. Show your child this in action.

### 4. Directly Teach Your Child Respectful Self-Assertion

Children need to know they can get their needs met while being respectful of other people. Give your child simple, powerful scripts they can use in everyday life:

- "It's my turn now."
- "Hey, stop that."
- "Hands off my body."
- "It's not okay to hurt."
- "I don't like being called that. I want you to call me by my name."

These scripts accomplish two things: they assert the child's needs while maintaining respect for the other person.

### 5. Build Social Skills Through Play and Coaching

**Bullies often target kids who seem isolated or unsure.** If your child has social challenges, support them in building confidence - but not by pushing them into uncomfortable situations.

**Specific skills to practice together:**
- Roleplay joining games
- Navigating playground dynamics
- Introducing themselves

**A key social skill for joining groups:** Kids who are successful in joining groups of kids usually observe first and find a way to fit into the group, rather than just barging in. This specific skill might need to be practiced.

**Observe and coach:** Watch how your child interacts with peers and offer gentle coaching based on what you observe.

**Help children trust their inner guidance.** Sometimes kids want peer acceptance so much that they continue to hang around a group even when one of the group leaders begins to mistreat them. Help your child by:
1. Listening to what they say about peer interactions
2. Helping them learn to check in with their own inner wisdom about which friendships feel safe and respectful
3. Working to provide healthy relationship opportunities

### 6. Teach Your Child How the Dynamics of Bullying Work

**The core dynamic:** Bullies are testing for a reaction. If the aggression gives the bully what they're looking for - a feeling of power from successfully pushing the other child's buttons - the aggression will generally escalate. But if the target stays calm, the bully often loses interest.

**Why this knowledge matters:** When children understand the why behind bullying behavior, they can respond without taking it personally and without reacting in ways that escalate the situation.

**Timing is critical:** Discuss this issue with every child BEFORE they might be subject to bullying, so they can stand up for themselves successfully when a bully first "tests" them. The first response matters.

### 7. Practice With Roleplays So Your Child Feels Comfortable Responding

**What to explain to your child:**
- The bully wants to provoke a response that makes them feel powerful
- Showing emotion and fighting back are exactly what the bully feeds off
- While your child cannot control the bully, they can always control their own response
- In every interaction, how they respond will either inflame the situation or defuse it
- Your child needs to avoid getting "hooked" no matter how mad the bully makes them

**The best strategy - the dignity principle:** Maintain your own dignity while letting the bully maintain theirs. This means withdrawing from the situation without attacking or demeaning the other person.

**Physical techniques to practice:**
- Stand tall
- Make eye contact
- Use a strong voice
- Stay calm (teach counting to ten)

**Scripts to practice until your child has a strong, self-assured tone:**
- "You know, I'm just going to ignore that comment."
- "I think I have something else to do right now."
- "No thank you."

Then, just walk away.

**The key insight to reinforce:** They cannot control the bully's behavior, but they can control their own response.

### 8. When Your Child First Begins to Use Technology, Teach, Supervise, and Stay Involved

**How online bullying differs from in-person bullying:** Kids who would not engage in unkindness face-to-face may find it harder to resist bullying online because they can ignore the impact of their actions. But fundamentally, it is still an abuse of power.

**When your child first begins to use social media, review it with them daily.** Keep an attitude of curiosity, support, and humor. The goal is to help children develop good judgment through interactions where they have a chance to safely reflect on choices they made.

**Questions to ask:**
- "What was fun about your online time today?"
- "Did anything feel confusing or upsetting?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"

**Cyber safety rules to teach:**
- Never share your passwords, even with friends
- Review privacy settings regularly with your parents
- Do not share anything that could hurt or embarrass anyone
- Never forward anything that could be hurtful
- Being kind to others online will help to keep you safe
- Remember that being mean online or forwarding hurtful messages is just like being mean or spreading rumors or embarrassing someone in person
- Always come to a parent right away if something online makes you uncomfortable

**The advantage of cyberbullying - documentation:** The good news about bullying via technology is that you have a record.

**If your child is bullied online:**
1. Document everything with screenshots and dates
2. Block the person
3. Report it to the school, with documentation

### 9. Remove Shame: Walking Away Is Brave

Teach your child explicitly that there is no shame in:
- Being frightened by a bully
- Walking away
- Telling an adult and asking for help

**Why this matters:** Bullying situations can escalate. Saving face is less important than staying safe. Children need permission to prioritize their safety over appearing tough.

### 10. Teach Kids to Intervene to Prevent Bullying When They See It

**Research finding from bullying expert Michele Borba:** When bystanders intervene correctly, studies find they can stop bullying more than half the time and within 10 seconds.

Empower your child to be a **defender**, not a bystander.

**The two best intervention strategies:**

**Strategy 1: Partner with the victim and remove them from danger**
- Go stand with the victim physically
- Turn the victim away from the bully
- Walk them off in the other direction toward adult help
- Use phrases like: "You look upset" or "I've been looking for you" or "The teacher sent me to find you"

**Strategy 2: Get help and recruit other bystanders**
- Bullies love an audience, so take the audience away
- Get other kids on your side by waving them over, yelling "We need your help"
- Confront the bully: "You're being mean"
- Then lead the exit: "Come on, let's go!"

**Safety override:** If you are at all worried about safety, shout for a teacher or dial 911 on a cell phone.

### 11. Teach Your Child Basic Bully Avoidance

**The key principle:** Bullies operate where adults are not present.

**Specific avoidance strategies if your child has been bullied:**
- Avoid unsupervised hallways
- Avoid unsupervised bathrooms
- Avoid unsupervised areas of the playground
- Sit in the front of the school bus
- Stand in the front of the line
- Sit at a lunch table near the cafeteria chaperones

### 12. Do Not Hesitate to Intervene

**Your job as the parent is to protect your child.** This means that in addition to teaching your child to stick up for themselves, you may need to call the teacher or principal.

**Even if your child begs you not to tell the school:**
- Document everything
- Advocate fiercely

**Why emotional bullying matters:** Emotional bullying and exclusion can be just as damaging as physical aggression. Do not minimize it.

**Escalation path if needed:**
1. Report to the school
2. If the school does not take it seriously, escalate
3. Consider requesting a safety plan
4. Consider transferring schools
5. Consider homeschooling if necessary

## Summary of Key Principles

**The goal is not to prevent all unkindness** but to build children who can respond with confidence and know when to seek help.

**Connection is foundational** - it is the 80% that makes everything else work.

**Modeling matters profoundly** - children learn relationship patterns from watching parents, including whether to use power over others or allow others to use power over them.

**Understanding bullying dynamics empowers children** - when they know bullies are testing for reactions, they can choose not to provide the reaction the bully seeks.

**Practice through roleplay is essential** - scripts and responses must be rehearsed until they become natural and can be delivered with a strong, self-assured tone.

**Walking away and seeking help are brave, not weak** - children need explicit permission to prioritize safety over saving face.

**Bystanders have power** - properly trained, they can stop bullying more than half the time and within 10 seconds.

**Punishment does not work for bullies** - systemic approaches like restorative justice and culture change are more effective.

**Parents must be willing to advocate fiercely** - even when children ask them not to, even if it means escalating to school transfers or homeschooling.
