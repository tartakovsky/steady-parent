## Core Principle: Toilet Training as Partnership

Toilet training is fundamentally a **partnership** between parent and child. The parent's role is to set the stage and create conditions for success, but the child must do the actual work of learning body awareness and control. This partnership model explains why pushiness backfires: it disrupts the collaborative dynamic and turns training into a power struggle.

When handled with **good cheer and confidence** that the child will master it of their own volition, toilet training becomes enormously empowering for the child. This is a major developmental milestone, and the parent's job is to make it a positive experience.

## Why Pooping Is Harder Than Peeing for Many Toddlers

Several factors make defecation training more challenging than urination training, especially for boys:

**The squatting preference**: It is very common for toddlers to want to squat privately to poop. This is a natural body position for defecation. The child who retreats to their room to squat in their underwear is following a biological instinct, not being defiant.

**Physical mechanics of sitting toilets**: Dangling legs on a standard toilet tighten rectal muscles and make defecation difficult. The child needs solid support under their feet to be able to push effectively. This is why a low potty or a sturdy stool under feet is essential, not optional.

**Psychological component for boys**: Sitting on a toilet that can loudly flush and make things disappear can be frightening. Boys especially may have anxiety about this since they typically stand to pee and rarely need to sit on the "scary" fixture.

## The "Almost Trained" Profile

A child who:
- Wakes up dry in the morning consistently
- Has relatively few urination accidents
- Is successful with peeing in the potty
- Only struggles with pooping

...has demonstrated sufficient bodily control to complete training. This child is NOT "not ready" as pediatricians sometimes suggest. The child has the physical readiness and just needs help with the final step. Putting such a child back in diapers would be counterproductive because they are very close to being fully trained.

## The No-Conflict Approach

**Never punish or express disappointment** at accidents. The stakes become too high when there's emotional charge around failures, and the child may rebel. The correct response to accidents is casual and forward-looking: "Oh well, accidents are how we learn. Soon you'll get it in the potty every time."

**Never fight over potty training**. When parents avoid power struggles, the prognosis for the child mastering this last step fairly quickly is very good. The parent who has maintained this non-combative stance has set excellent conditions for success.

**Never be pushy**. Pushiness complicates toilet training and will backfire. Enthusiasm is good; pressure is counterproductive.

## Practical Framework: The 21 Steps

### Phase 1: Building Motivation and Understanding

**1. Connect training to something the child wants**

Use an upcoming transition like moving to a new classroom where "the rule is that kids need to poop in the potty." This externalizes the requirement (it's the rule, not the parent's demand) and connects it to something desirable. Tell the child you will help them learn to do this.

**2. Maximize child control over the process**

Have the child choose their own potty in the store. This creates ownership and investment. Choice matters because it gives the child agency in a process that otherwise feels like something being done TO them.

**3. Equipment selection matters**

Use a potty rather than the toilet initially, for two reasons:
- It allows squatting or near-squatting position for easier defecation
- It removes the scary flushing element

If the child prefers a seat on the big toilet, their feet MUST rest securely on a stool. Consider a seat that makes music when something is deposited, which adds positive reinforcement through novelty.

**4. Model the behavior**

Let the child see both parents sitting on the toilet. Narrate what you're doing in the bathroom. Children learn through observation and this normalizes sitting to poop.

**5. Use books as preparation**

Read every book available about toileting. Recommended: "Toilet Learning" by Alison Mack. Books normalize the process and give the child mental frameworks for understanding what's happening.

### Phase 2: Building Physical Comfort and Habit

**6. Set expectations clearly but kindly**

Tell the child you are tired of washing so many underpants. Remind them you love them no matter what. Be clear that you will be happy when they can poop in the potty. The message is: "This matters, AND I'm not mad at you." Let them know they should tell you when they're ready.

**7. Build muscle memory through repetition**

Encourage sitting on the potty fully clothed, as many times a day as possible. This builds the physical habit of getting on and off. Tell the child that when they are ready, they will poop on the potty. Communicate that they are in charge of their own body, while implying that of course eventually they will do this since all people poop in the potty.

**8. Progress to naked sitting**

Once comfortable fully clothed, have the child sit naked on the potty. Read potty books and other books while they sit there. This builds the association between bare bottom and potty, and makes sitting there pleasant rather than anxious.

**9. Make the potty a desirable place to be**

Toddlers are busy. You have to make the potty a place they love being if you want them to spend any time there.

Options for making it festive:
- Sing a special song when sitting
- Give a cheerio or small treat each time they sit naked
- Cheer loudly each time they get on and off

**Critical warning**: Never force the child to sit on the potty or stay there. Forcing creates negative associations that will set back the entire process.

### Phase 3: Making the Connection

**10. Establish the poop-potty association through ritual**

After accidents, dump the poop into the potty. Explain that every day their body makes poop and it belongs in the potty or toilet. Admire it there without hurrying to dispose of it. Let the child eventually help empty the potty into the toilet and be the one to flush. Cheer and wave goodbye to the poop each time.

This ritual serves multiple purposes: it shows where poop "belongs," makes disposal fun rather than shameful, and gives the child a participatory role.

**11. Develop body awareness through language**

Notice when the child shows signs of needing to defecate (becoming quiet, withdrawing to their room, starting to squat). Give them language for what's happening: "Are you ready to poop? Tell Mommy so we can go to the potty."

The child may not immediately start telling you, but they will learn the concept that when they feel this way, the goal is to communicate and head to the potty. At first they will need help recognizing the signals.

### Phase 4: Active Transition

**12. Catch the moment when possible**

If you can catch the child just before they begin to defecate, take them to the potty. They will be resistant because their instinct says "get to my room" but provide positive momentum: "Your new potty is waiting for you! Don't worry, I'll help you. Let's pull those pants down quick! You will be so proud of yourself!"

**13. Stay calm when attempts don't work**

If the child sits on the potty and doesn't poop, then later poops in their pants, remain calm. Help put the poop in the potty and admire it there. Say: "Poop belongs in the potty. Soon you'll be pooping in the potty every time, when you're ready."

**14. Frame success as internal pride, not external approval**

When the child actually goes in the potty, tell them they must be so proud of themselves. Do NOT tell them YOU are proud, or they'll wonder what's in it for them. The motivation needs to be internal, not external pleasing.

The child will gradually begin associating the feeling of needing to go with the potty instead of their room. But don't assume one success means toilet training is complete. True toilet training is when the child knows when they have to go AND gets themselves there.

**15. Praise effort and direction, not just results**

If the child tells you they need to use the bathroom, even if they don't make it in time, celebrate the communication. This is progress in the right direction.

**17. Keep stakes low**

Respond to accidents with a shrug and forward-looking optimism: "Oh well, accidents are how we learn. Soon you'll get it in the potty every time." Never express disappointment or the stakes become too high.

**18. Enthusiastic but not pushy**

This balance is critical. Enthusiasm motivates; pushiness creates resistance.

**19. Praise partial success**

Praise is warranted if the child tried to let you know or tried to get to the bathroom, even if they didn't make it. "You noticed as soon as you started to poop! I am so proud of you! Let's go quick to the bathroom in case there's more to come out. Then we'll clean this up together. You noticed yourself when you needed the potty! Next time you'll probably notice sooner and get all the way to the bathroom!"

### Phase 5: Full Transition Methods

**20. The "naked day" approach (for willing children)**

Ask directly if the child wants help beginning to use the potty on their own. If they seem open to it, tell them they'll need to pay attention and yell for you as soon as they might need to poop, then run to the potty.

If they agree, let them go naked from the waist down on a day when you can pay constant attention. At the first sign a bathroom visit might be needed, grab their hand and go together. Greet any success with warm approval.

This works best if the child is fairly regular about what time of day they typically go. Warning: may not work if the child's usual pooping spot has carpet.

**21. The "locked door" strategy (for resistant children)**

This is for children who are very comfortable sitting naked on their potty and seem interested in using it, but still insist on going to their room to poop.

Stay with the child upstairs. When they head for their room, go with them. "Accidentally" discover together that the door is locked. Tell them you will find the key in a minute, but in the meantime if they need to poop you will help them use the potty.

**Critical warning**: This ploy only works once. You MUST stress afterward that you have the key handy in case it ever happens again, or the child may develop a fear of getting locked in their room.

## What NOT to Do (Anti-Patterns)

**Don't put a nearly-trained child back in diapers**. A child who is dry at night and successful with peeing is too close to completion to regress. This advice, sometimes given by pediatricians, is misguided for children at this stage.

**Don't assume jealousy of a new sibling is the cause**. While normal sibling jealousy exists, the pooping issue is typically developmental, not emotional. The private squatting behavior is very common regardless of family circumstances.

**Don't use rewards that externalize motivation**. Telling the child YOU are proud shifts focus to pleasing you rather than their own bodily mastery. Frame success as their achievement: "You must be so proud of yourself."

**Don't interpret the behavior as defiance**. A child who goes to their room to squat privately is following biological instinct, not acting out. Understanding this prevents the parent from responding punitively.

**Don't rush the disposal ritual**. Taking time to admire the poop in the potty before flushing serves important psychological purposes. Hurrying past this step misses an opportunity for positive association.

## The Role of New Siblings

Normal jealousy toward a new baby (alternating between loving and wanting to pinch) does not typically cause pooping resistance. The private squatting behavior and difficulty transitioning to the toilet are common developmental patterns that occur regardless of family composition.

Daily special time with the older child from both parents is excellent practice for maintaining connection, and may help generally, but is unlikely to be the specific solution to the pooping issue.

## Signs of Readiness That Indicate Training Can Succeed

- Waking up dry in the morning consistently
- Few urination accidents
- Success with peeing in the potty
- Predictable elimination timing
- Child can communicate needs verbally
- Child shows awareness of elimination (retreating to private spot, squatting behavior)

All of these indicate sufficient bodily control and awareness for successful training. The issue is behavioral transition, not physical readiness.

## Timeline Considerations

When there's an external deadline (like a classroom transition in June), parents need to fully focus on the process and get the child onboard and positive about it. The approach can be accelerated with consistent attention while still maintaining the non-punitive, child-led philosophy.
