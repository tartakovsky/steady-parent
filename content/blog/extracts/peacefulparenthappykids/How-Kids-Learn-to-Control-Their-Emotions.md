## Core Principle: Say No to Behavior, Not Emotions

The foundational distinction in helping children manage emotions is understanding what parents should and should not limit. Parents need to set limits on behavior all day, every day. Children cannot run into the street, throw food at each other, or pee on their baby brother. However, children should be allowed to feel and express their anger, disappointment, and sadness.

This distinction matters because when we don't "allow" children to get upset, we're actually making it harder for them to learn to manage their emotions, not easier.

## Why Suppressing Emotions Backfires

### The Impossibility of Preventing Upset

You cannot actually keep your child from getting upset, regardless of whether you "allow" it. Telling a child not to cry won't keep them from being upset. It only sends the message that there's something scary or shameful about their emotions, so they'd better try to hide them.

### The Mechanism of Emotional Dysregulation

When humans repress emotion, those emotions are no longer under conscious control. This causes them to "pop out" unregulated, leading the child to lash out or act out. This dysregulation is what scares parents, when their child seems out of control.

**Key insight**: Kids don't get dysregulated because we "allow" their emotions. Children and adults reliably escalate into dysregulation when they don't feel heard. When we tell someone not to "get upset," we can count on them becoming more upset.

### The Accumulation Effect

When children feel an emotion but have gotten the message that they "aren't allowed" to feel it, they try to push the feeling down. This may work momentarily, but the feelings build up and make kids tense, anxious, demanding, and whiny. Eventually, these repressed feelings that are no longer under conscious control bubble up to the surface and explode, resulting in behavior that is even more out of control.

**Conclusion**: Denying emotion or making ourselves wrong for having emotions doesn't help us control emotions. It makes control harder.

## The Eight Actions Parents Take to Help Children Regulate Emotions

Notice that all the action items start with what the parents do. The child learns emotional regulation through the parent's behavior, not through being told what to feel.

### 1. Model Self-Regulation

**What this means**: Parents resist their own "tantrums," such as yelling. Instead, they take a parent time-out to calm themselves down.

**Practical application**: If the child is too young for the parent to leave the room, do as much emotional processing at other times as possible, so you can stay calmer while with your kids. In the moment, slow things down and take responsibility for how you express your emotions.

**Why this works**: Children learn from parents. When we yell, they learn to yell. When we speak respectfully, they learn to speak respectfully. Every time you model in front of your child how to stop yourself from acting badly when you're angry, your child is learning emotional regulation.

**Important distinction**: This is not about "stuffing" or repressing emotions. That would make them harder to control. The approach is to handle emotions responsibly by noticing feelings and tolerating them, but NOT taking action. Every time you do this, you're strengthening your neural networks to manage your emotions. This is exactly what we're trying to teach children to do.

**Encouragement for imperfect parents**: Most people are still working on this. It's the work of a lifetime. Just keep taking steps in the right direction.

### 2. Prioritize a Deep Nurturing Connection

**Neurological foundation**: Babies grow the neural wiring to soothe themselves by being soothed by their parents. Even older children need to feel connected to parents or they cannot regulate themselves emotionally.

**What to do when dysregulation happens**: When you notice your child getting dysregulated, the most important thing you can do is to calm yourself, then reconnect.

**Why connection eliminates misbehavior**: When kids feel that we're on their side, even when we need to say no to them, they WANT to cooperate. That warm, delighted connection eliminates a lot of "misbehavior."

### 3. Accept Your Child's Feelings, Even When Inconvenient

**Example language**: "Oh, Sweetie, I know that's disappointing... I'm so sorry things didn't work out the way you wanted."

**Multiple benefits of empathy as the go-to response**:
- The child feels heard, so they don't have to escalate
- They learn that emotions may not feel good, but they're not dangerous
- They accept and process emotions as they come up, instead of stuffing them (where they just get uglier)
- The child knows someone understands, so she doesn't have to yell to be heard
- When parental support helps them learn they can live through bad feelings and the sun will come out the next day, they begin to develop resilience

### 4. Make It Easy to Talk About Emotions

**Research-backed approach**: Children grow in emotional intelligence when parents talk about their own feelings, acknowledge their children's feelings, and wonder aloud about those of other people.

**Example**: "That little boy in the stroller is crying... I wonder what's wrong? What do you think he needs?"

**On teaching emotion words**: Yes, teaching children words for emotions validates their experience and helps them understand others. However, labeling emotions when tempers are raging just makes the child feel analyzed instead of understood.

**Why talking during upset is counterproductive**: When the child is upset, talking of any kind takes the child out of their heart and into their head, which makes it harder to work through the feelings.

**Better approach during difficult moments**: Start by simply accepting your child's emotions and offering compassion, even if you need to limit your child's actions.

### 5. Limit Actions as Necessary

**The goal**: Create a safe space for the child to feel their emotions. This never means letting them hit you or break things.

**Understanding children's limited capacity**: Children aren't yet capable of making all their own decisions in life, even when they're thinking well. When they're angry, it's not surprising that they do and say things they'll be sorry for later.

**How to handle hitting**: Simply move away if your child tries to hit you. If you need to hold their hands to keep them from hitting, do so, but keep that to a minimum.

**Key insight about rage**: Rage needs to feel heard or it escalates. If you can acknowledge that you see how angry your child is and empathize with why they're upset, they usually won't need to show you how upset they are by hitting.

### 6. Model Repair and Care

**Reframing the angry child**: Your angry child is not a bad person, but a hurting, very young human. When kids aren't controlling their emotions, it's because they can't at that moment. This is not the time to teach them not to be rude.

**What happens when you stay compassionate**: If you can stay compassionate, your child will feel safe enough to surface, feel, and express the tears and fears that are driving their anger and acting out. If you can help them feel safe enough to actually feel those tears and fears, they'll evaporate, and the anger and acting out will vanish too.

**Post-incident conversation (after everyone is calm)**: Talk with your child about what happened, not to criticize or lecture, but to apologize, empathize, and restore connection.

**Example language**: "We were all so upset that we started yelling. But that's no way to work things out with someone you love. I'm sorry I lost my temper. I know you must have been so upset, too, to say/do those things. I'm ready to listen now to what you were upset about."

**On setting boundaries about yelling**: Yes, you should tell your child they are not allowed to yell at you. But they can't take that in until they feel heard. Wait until you first listen and offer understanding. Then you might say: "I see why you were so upset that you yelled at me. I'm sorry I didn't understand sooner. You never need to yell to get my attention. I will always listen and try to help."

**The natural outcome**: From this place of mutual understanding, your child will almost certainly apologize, and they will be much more motivated in the future to express themselves without yelling.

### 7. Guide Behavior Without Punishment

**What doesn't work**: Spankings, time outs, consequences, and shaming don't give kids the help they need with their emotions.

**Why punishment backfires**: The message kids get is that the emotions that drove them to "misbehave" are bad. So kids try to repress those emotions, and their emotional backpack gets stuffed even more full of bad feelings.

**The cycle punishment creates**: Those repressed feelings keep bubbling up out of the emotional backpack looking for healing, and the child lashes out because the emotions feel so scary. This is one reason punishment actually leads to more misbehavior.

**What to do instead**: Help your child stay on track with loving guidance and emotion coaching to help them process emotions.

### 8. Act Like the Grown-Up

**What happens when parents don't take charge**: When we aren't able to take charge in our home, setting appropriate limits and creating a positive tone, kids don't feel safe. They worry that we aren't able to meet their emotional needs, so they start working hard to take charge themselves.

**How this manifests**: Children become bossy and demanding. Even worse for their development, they stop coming to parents with their tears and fears. They don't trust us with their vulnerability. They have to keep their defenses up, so they develop a chip on their shoulder.

**Developmental consequences**: Children can't relax and tackle things that scare them (otherwise known as age-appropriate developmental tasks), like learning to work out conflicts with peers and taking the risk of trying new things.

**The solution to "attitude"**: Help the child feel safe by committing to being a calm, emotionally generous parent who sets empathic limits and models emotional intelligence.

## What Children Learn From This Approach

Kids who are parented this way learn to "control" their emotions because they have a healthy emotional life, not because they've been told not to feel, or been punished or shamed for their feelings.

**Specific lessons children internalize**:
- Emotions aren't bad, they're just part of the richness of being human. When you allow yourself to feel, the emotions begin to fade away.
- We don't usually have a choice about what we feel, but we always have a choice about how we choose to act.

## The Demands on Parents and the Reward

This approach demands a lot of the parent. But the motivation is love for your child.

**Encouraging insight for parents still working on self-regulation**: Your kids will almost certainly be better at managing their emotions than you are. Why? You're doing the hard work now to help them learn how. And most of the work, surprise, is on yourself.
