## Why Children Need Limits

Children need limits because the process of exercising self-restraint literally builds self-control. When a child faces the necessity of reining in an impulse toward something they want (like grabbing a toy from a baby) in order to have something they want more (a warm, happy connection with you), they develop the neural pathways for self-regulation. This is confirmed by research findings in neurology. **Limits teach kids to set limits for themselves, which is otherwise known as self-discipline.**

The key insight is that limits are not just rules imposed from outside - they are the training ground for internal regulation. The child practices restraining impulses in the context of relationship, and this practice becomes the foundation for lifelong self-control.

## The Parenting Spectrum: Three Approaches to Limits

### Permissive Parenting (Too Few Limits)

**What it looks like:** Parents avoid setting limits, especially with toddlers, because they hate causing their child grief, don't want to incite tantrums, and don't want their child to be angry at them.

**Why parents choose this:** Often stems from a desire to create an egalitarian home, rejection of the authoritarian households they grew up in, wanting kids who think for themselves, or fear of losing their child's love.

**What happens over time:** Children do not develop the ability to tolerate frustration or to manage themselves. These children are often called "spoiled" by others.

**Research findings on permissive parenting outcomes:**
- Children become "difficult" - unable to manage themselves
- Inconsiderate of others
- Unable to form mutually satisfying relationships

**Critical clarification:** Attachment Parenting is about meeting kids' needs for connection and does NOT preclude setting limits. No Attachment expert discourages empathic limit setting. The rejection of authoritarian parenting is good, but rejecting the role of a parent is not. **All parents have a critical responsibility to teach and guide their young. That necessarily includes setting limits.**

### Authoritarian Parenting (Punitive Limits)

**What it looks like:** Parents boast about having no problem setting limits and take pride in their child's quick obedience to directives. "I count to three and they jump. No raising a brat for me!"

**Short-term appearance:** Children often do well until high school.

**Long-term outcomes:**
- Haven't developed good judgment
- Haven't developed the ability to think for themselves
- More likely to go along with peers (lacking internal compass)
- More likely to become bullies or victims
- Have difficulty managing their anger
- More prone to depression as adults

**Why punitive limits backfire:** Studies show that when we try to control kids, especially punitively, they react with anger and resistance, as all humans do. All humans push back when they feel controlled. Limits are perceived as punitive or controlling by the child unless offered with empathy.

**The psychological damage:** Authoritarian limit setting makes children feel like bad people. This leaves them hopeless and depressed.

### The Sweet Spot: Empathic Limit-Setting

**The research-backed finding:** Children develop optimally when we set limits as necessary but do so with empathy.

**Why empathy changes everything:** Empathy makes your limit more palatable to your child, so she doesn't resist it as much. That reduced resistance is what allows her to internalize the limit. Kids are more willing to "follow" our guidance if we empathize - they understand that you get why they want something and that they aren't a bad person for wanting it, even if you don't let them have it.

**The core principle: Kids need appropriate limits, but it's how you do it that counts.**

## The Four Components of Effective Limit-Setting

### 1. Start with a Strong, Supportive Connection

Your child needs to know you're on their side before limits feel acceptable rather than adversarial. Without this foundation, your attempts at empathy during limit-setting will fall flat because the child experiences you as sabotaging their happiness.

### 2. See It from Their Point of View and Offer Genuine Empathy

The empathy must be genuine - something they can actually feel. This is not a technique to get compliance; it's authentic recognition of their experience and desires.

### 3. Resist the Temptation to Be Punitive in Any Way

**Setting the limit teaches the lesson. Anything more backfires.**

This means no punishment layered on top of the limit. The distinction is crucial: stopping a behavior and enforcing a boundary is different from punishing a child for having wanted something or having tried something.

### 4. Only Set the Limits You Really Need to Set

See his life from his point of view so that his life is more about connection and discovery than about limits and frustration. **Saying "No" too often undermines your relationship.**

## Which Limits Are Truly Necessary?

### Non-Negotiable Categories

**Safety (for himself and others):** Always non-negotiable.

**Treating others with respect:** Important, though always a work in progress. The skill here is teaching him to advocate for his own needs without attacking anyone else.

### Developmentally Appropriate Limits

Other rules will change over time as children mature:
- Learning to clean up their own messes
- Not interrupting mid-sentence
- Various life skills and social norms

**The key to determining readiness:** If you're seeing things from his perspective and keeping in mind what's age-appropriate, you will know what he is ready to handle.

**Don't forget needs:** You will also see what he needs - for instance, a good night's sleep - and be prepared to enforce him getting those things.

### The Guiding Principle

Don't go out of your way to create unnecessary limits, but don't hesitate to set necessary ones. Ensure you have a terrific connection with your child so that you can offer genuine empathy, and he can feel it, while the limit setting is taking place.

## Limits vs. Punishments: A Critical Distinction

### What Setting Limits Actually Means

Setting limits means sometimes you will stop your child from doing something. You may in fact have to remove him from the park.

### Why Framing Matters Enormously

**If you remove the child as punishment:**
- He will get stuck in the injustice
- He will be angry at you
- The lesson is lost

**If you remove the child with empathy:**
- Example language: "It was too hard for you to stop throwing sand. But throwing sand hurts people, so we had to leave. Soon you will be able to stop yourself, so we can stay and play. We can try again tomorrow."
- The child will still be upset that he had to leave
- But he sees you as on his side
- He sees staying at the park next time as within his power

### The Long-Term Difference

**Loving guidance and empathic limits:** Help your child WANT to follow your guidance, so those good habits become part of who he is, whether you're there or not.

**"Consequences" designed to punish:** Kids end up rebelling against them. The external control never transforms into internal motivation.

## The Principle: Limit Behavior, Allow Feelings

### Tantrums Are Natural Responses to Limits

When you set limits, it's natural for a child to feel anger and disappointment. She is allowed to have her feelings. Your job is to accept those feelings and love her through them.

**An important pattern:** The more we accept their feelings with empathy, the less overwhelming their feelings become, and the less they'll tantrum over time.

### What Happens When We Can't Tolerate Their Emotional Reactions

If we can't tolerate her anger and sadness - when her reaction to the limit is not met with empathy - several damaging things happen:

1. She learns that part of who she is is unacceptable
2. She learns that there are ways in which she is shameful
3. She feels completely alone in her experience
4. The anger and sadness don't vanish - they go underground
5. Underground emotions are magnified and sow the seeds of depression

### The Concept of an Emotional "Holding Environment"

**What parents provide:** A safe container where the child can experience intense emotions while the limit remains firm.

**What this allows:**
- The child has freedom to rail against the limit
- The child can cry and grieve about it
- The child finally accepts it and moves on

### What "Moving On" Actually Looks Like

Moving on consists of letting go of that path and finding another, acceptable path. Example: "I can't play with Maggie right now; I'll see her tomorrow."

**Why firm limits with empathy enable this:** The child learns that the world is indeed full of obstacles to her desires, but she isn't left fighting that (which is what happens when the limit is not clearly reinforced). She grieves and then moves on, looking for another way to feel better.

### The Deeper Outcomes of This Approach

**What the child learns:**
1. She cannot always get her way, but she gets something better: someone who loves and accepts the full range of who she is
2. She can tolerate her rage and misery and feel better afterwards (the beginning of resilience)
3. She can consider other courses of action

**This unconditional positive regard becomes the core of unshakeable positive self-esteem and stable internal happiness.**

**Example of resilience in action:** "I can't have my birthday party at the circus because we can't afford it. I cried about it all day yesterday. But mom and dad seem to understand. Maybe they would help me design a soccer party in the park and let me have the girls stay for a sleepover."

## How Many Limits is Optimal?

### More Frustrations Are NOT Better

Two reasons why deliberately creating frustrations is counterproductive:

**Reason 1 - The bond must be strong:** You need a strong emotional bond for the child to accept your empathy. If she experiences you as sabotaging her happiness by creating frustrations, or as arbitrary or unfair, she won't accept your attempts to empathize. After all, you have the power to grant her desire and you are refusing to do so, over and over.

**Reason 2 - Life provides plenty already:** Kids have plenty of frustrating occurrences in their lives on a daily basis without you creating them.

## Special Considerations for Babies

### The Core Principles Still Apply

Sometimes you need to enforce a limit (like not letting him stick his finger in the light socket), and you need to empathize with his disappointment.

### Why Babies Need Fewer Limits

Babies can tolerate much less frustration than older children because they simply haven't learned yet how to manage their feelings.

### The Mood Habit Connection

**Critical finding:** There is increasing evidence that moods in infancy lay the groundwork for mood habits later in life.

**The implication:** You want to minimize the amount of time your baby spends unhappy. If she gets used to being unhappy, she will think unhappiness is a normal state and do her best to recreate it throughout her life.

**Bottom line for babies:** Always minimize frustration.

### Practical Approach for Babies

You can't give her everything she wants, but luckily babies can generally be distracted. Babyproof and stay a step ahead of your baby.

### The Natural Progression

You will find yourself gradually increasing your limit setting as your child moves from babyhood to toddlerhood to preschooler, because it becomes clear both that appropriate behavior demands it and that she can handle it.

### Important Reframe

She's not trying to drive you crazy, and she's not bad for wanting something, even something that is patently impossible. What your baby needs is your empathy when you have to say no.

## Giving Children More Say Over Time

### The Developmental Trajectory

Giving kids more and more say over their lives as they gain maturity is certainly desirable.

### The Limits of Early Autonomy

We would not let a toddler make all his own decisions. Most fourteen-year-olds are not yet ready to make all their own decisions either.

### The Key Requirement for Parents

As a parent, you need to feel comfortable setting limits when necessary. This is true regardless of your philosophical commitments to egalitarianism or attachment parenting.
