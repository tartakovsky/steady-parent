# Helping a 7-Year-Old with Eating and Sleep Independence

Source: Dr. Laura Markham, Peaceful Parent Happy Kids

## Core Framework: Both Behaviors Are Developmentally Normal

Before addressing either issue, Dr. Markham establishes an important perspective: both refusing to eat at meals and needing parental presence to sleep are developmentally normal and age-appropriate for a 7-year-old. The child will outgrow both behaviors. This framing matters because it shifts the parent's approach from "fixing a problem child" to "supporting normal development."

## Picky Eating and Grazing Behavior

### Understanding the Root Cause

There are two possible explanations for why a child eats little at meals but asks for food an hour later:

1. **The child is a natural grazer** - Many humans are not biologically designed to eat big meals, particularly as small children. Their bodies function better with smaller, more frequent eating.

2. **It's a control issue** - The child may be asserting autonomy through food choices.

Either way, the underlying principle is the same: **you don't want the child to stuff himself to bursting, and you don't want to get into power struggles about eating.**

### The Division of Responsibility

**The parent decides what foods the child can eat. The child decides how much food to eat at any given time.**

This division exists because fights about food intake lead to ugly issues later in life, and these are battles parents will never win. The power struggle itself causes more harm than the grazing behavior.

### Two Approaches to Meals

**Option 1: Expect three meals a day plus snacks**
This option will be frustrating for both parent and child because the child has already proven he has a hard time doing it. It creates a power struggle, which is counterproductive.

**Option 2: Abandon the concept of meals for now (Recommended)**
- Parents can continue having meals normally
- The child should sit and eat with the family (maintaining the social ritual)
- Don't expect the child to eat much during the meal
- Don't drag out the meal to let him finish
- When parents are done, the child can either:
  - Sit and read while finishing his food if he wants, OR
  - If he feels full, food is taken away and he's excused from the table

### Handling the "I'm Hungry" Request an Hour Later

When the child asks for food an hour after a meal:

**Option A:** Pull out the same food he didn't eat at the meal and reheat it in the microwave.

**Option B:** If that's too difficult or unappetizing, give him something else that is healthy:
- Yogurt
- A can of soup
- A frozen entree
- Raw carrots
- Frozen peas

### Reframing "Meals" as "Eating Events"

Stop thinking in terms of full meals. Instead, focus on any given eating event getting some key nutrient into him:
- Protein
- Vegetables (primarily Vitamins A and C)
- Iron
- Calcium

**Practical example:** The child may live on eight or so small snacks a day. One might be a glass of milk and some carrots. One might be a scrambled egg or a baked sweet potato. There's no reason the child needs to eat a big meal.

### Keep It Simple for Yourself

- Don't stress yourself out about it
- Don't turn snacks into meals by making a big production out of them
- The child can sit and eat and look at a book
- Make it easy on yourself

### Why Continue Having the Child Attend Family Meals

Even though you're not expecting him to eat much, having him attend meals serves important purposes:
- He gets used to the idea of meals
- He learns conversation skills
- He learns manners

Over time, you'll find he focuses more on the food at those meals and naturally stops needing as many snacks. Dr. Markham notes her 16-year-old now inhales food at meals and asks for several more servings - the grazing phase is temporary.

## Teaching a Child to Sleep Independently

### Realistic Expectations

This process will take self-discipline on the parent's part because it will take **a few months to complete**. But at the end, the child will be comfortable sleeping in his bed all night.

### Step 0: The Conversation

Before beginning the process, talk with the child and introduce the idea that now that he is seven, he needs to learn to sleep by himself.

**Frame it developmentally:** Seven-year-olds go to school, they learn to read, they learn to ride a bike, and they learn to go to sleep by themselves.

**Provide reassurance:** You will always be there if he needs you in the night or when he is falling asleep. You will help him learn.

**Build motivation:** Praise him for any progress and tell him how proud you are that he is learning to sleep by himself. He needs some motivation to do what is, after all, a hard thing for most kids.

**Additional motivators that work for some kids:**
- Little prizes in the morning
- If he shows interest in eventually having sleepovers, praise his progress toward them

**Compensate with daytime connection:** Provide plenty of physical closeness and snuggles during the day to make up for his independence at night.

### The Bedtime Routine

Begin with a bedtime routine that gives the child a chance to wind down:
- Maybe a bath
- 2 stories
- Tucking in stuffed animals
- A backrub

**Timing is critical:** Begin early enough in the evening that he hasn't gotten his "second wind" yet. Bedtime routines usually take a full hour if they include a bath.

### The Gradual Progression (5 Phases)

**Phase 1: Hold while sitting (don't lie down)**

Hold your child until he falls asleep, but you can't lie down. The reason: lying down puts you in danger of falling asleep yourself, which defeats the purpose.

Use the time productively: meditate if you can, or think of something delightful you can look forward to.

**Helpful tool:** Give kids a large stuffed animal or pillow to hold and curl around. This substitutes for them being able to twine around you. In the beginning, definitely hold him so that he feels held.

**Phase 2: Touch but don't hold**

Once he's used to falling asleep with you sitting in bed by him and holding him, the next phase is to touch but not hold your child.

Kids resist this step, but eventually get used to falling asleep this way. Eventually, he will be able to fall asleep with you simply holding his hand, or putting your hand on his forehead.

**Phase 3: Sit next to without touching**

When he can fall asleep being touched but not held, begin to sit next to him while he falls asleep without actually touching him.

In the beginning, you will probably need to sit close enough that he can touch you briefly if he wants to reach out.

Make a big deal of how proud you are that he is able to do this.

**Phase 4: Gradually increase distance**

Begin sitting further and further away until eventually you are outside the bedroom door. This could take a month.

**Practical tip:** Dr. Markham used a flashlight to read, which was a welcome relief from sitting in the dark.

**Alternative variation:** Move quietly around the room, straightening up or folding laundry, while he falls asleep. This provides a sense of security without him depending on your physical proximity.

**Phase 5: Leave the room for increasing periods**

After he is used to falling asleep without you touching him, the process will move faster.

Leave the room for longer and longer periods. Use the framing: "I'll be right back, I just remembered I have to check the laundry."

Begin by sitting right outside his door with a good book.

### Handling Backsliding

Some days the child will backslide and need you to touch him again. That's okay - it won't sabotage your overall momentum, as long as it isn't frequent and the next day you're back to your program.

### Handling Night Wakings

**Why they happen:** While your child is still needing you to fall asleep, he will probably keep waking up at night. This is because when children wake slightly at night, they look around for whatever conditions were present when they fell asleep.

**Why they diminish:** Night wakings usually diminish as kids learn to put themselves to sleep, because when they wake slightly at night they're no longer looking around for mom.

**If he wakes and needs you at night:**

You can minimize him repeating that behavior by:
1. Returning him to his own bed
2. Repeating your bedtime practice of sitting near him while he falls asleep

Most parents lie down on the rug with a blanket for this. Yes, this means some nights on the floor in his room. But you are steadily moving in the direction of nighttime independence in a way that protects your son's sense of security.

**Alternative approach that won't sabotage progress:** Many parents who are teaching their child to fall asleep by himself just let him into their bed if he awakens at night. There is no problem with doing that. It will not sabotage what you are doing at bedtime. Once he is comfortable putting himself to sleep, he will generally be able to do that at night also.

### Special Consideration: Divorce

Sometimes a divorce, and shuttling between two homes, causes kids extra insecurity that slows this process. But they will still learn to sleep by themselves if you are clear about your intention that they are ready to do so and need to do so.

You may have to offer lots of extra connection and reassurance during the day.

### The End Result

Eventually, you'll find that he is asleep almost as soon as his head settles on the pillow, and you'll be amazed to find you actually have an evening.

## Why Not Just Let Them Cry It Out?

### The Question

A follow-up question asked: "Is it really so traumatic to just tell him to go to sleep and let him cry if necessary? He is seven, after all."

### Dr. Markham's Response

The gradual process is labor intensive by design. It is meant to be gradual and gentle, and to build the child's self-esteem and confidence.

**On whether cry-it-out is harmful:**

Every child is different, but Dr. Markham has never let her children cry themselves to sleep and cannot personally imagine doing so.

**Evidence from adults who experienced cry-it-out:**

1. Some adults cannot fall asleep without the company of a TV because they were left alone, terrified, in the dark without being given the help of being taught to fall asleep feeling safe.

2. Some adults still carry shame from being told they were babies when they struggled with nighttime fears.

### Reading the Child's Signals

A seven-year-old who insists on mom lying down with him and who cannot go to sleep by himself is on the sensitive end of the spectrum and needs a little extra help. Additionally, this particular child has been through a divorce.

**The key distinction:**

He is expressing a need that should be taken seriously. NOT given into in the way he wants it (sleeping with Mom every night). But definitely taken seriously, in the sense of: "I know this is hard for you and I am going to help you learn to do it."

This captures the balance: acknowledge the need is real, don't dismiss it, but also don't simply accommodate it indefinitely. Instead, provide scaffolded support to develop independence.
