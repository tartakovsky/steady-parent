# Colic Prevention and Treatment: Holding, Nutrition, and Probiotics

## The Central Question: Does Holding Babies Prevent Colic?

The conventional wisdom suggests that traditional cultures experience less colic because they hold their babies more frequently. However, this source presents a compelling counter-example that challenges this assumption and points toward alternative explanations.

## Counter-Evidence: A Case Study of Constant Holding with Persistent Colic

**Donella's experience** provides a detailed case study that contradicts the holding-prevents-colic hypothesis:

- She was a colicky baby herself despite being held constantly by three family members in rotation: her mother during the day, her 13-year-old half-sister after school, and her father (who was 56 at her birth, mother was 41) until nighttime
- Her son was born a month premature with lung difficulties requiring a week of hospitalization
- After bringing him home, she rarely put him down and responded to every whimper
- She carried him in a wrap throughout all daily activities, including outdoor chores like tending to dogs and cleaning horse stalls
- She nursed on demand
- Despite this constant holding and immediate responsiveness, her son cried almost all day and most of the night for five months straight

The key insight: **maximum possible holding and responsiveness did not prevent or cure the colic**, which directly contradicts theories that colic results from insufficient carrying or attention.

## Nutritional and Biological Explanations for Colic

### The Magnesium and B-6 Treatment

**Donella's father's discovery**: When Donella was a colicky baby, her father researched and gave her a combination of magnesium and B-6 vitamins. The result was near-instant improvement. Unfortunately, the exact dosage combination was lost when her father passed away before her son was born.

**Dr. Laura Markham's interpretation**: The rapid cure suggests "something was out of balance in your body" - pointing to a metabolic or nutritional deficiency rather than a behavioral cause. The hereditary pattern (mother and son both having colic) supports the possibility of an inherited nutritional processing issue.

### The Cow's Milk Elimination Finding

A study demonstrated that **when breastfeeding mothers stopped drinking cow's milk, half of their colicky babies improved**. This suggests that for a significant portion of colic cases, the cause is sensitivity to proteins passing through breast milk from the mother's diet.

The limitation: The other half of babies continued crying, indicating cow's milk is not the universal cause.

### The Probiotic Treatment Breakthrough

**The January 2007 Pediatrics study** combined two interventions:
1. Daily administration of 5 drops of the probiotic **L. reuteri** (beneficial gut bacteria)
2. Elimination of cow's milk from the breastfeeding mother's diet

**Results**:
- 95% of babies receiving probiotics improved
- Only 7% of control babies improved
- Timeline: Some improvement visible in the first week, dramatic improvement within a month

**Dr. Markham's assessment**: If this study is replicated by other researchers with similar results, probiotics will likely become the standard treatment for colic. In the meantime, parents of colicky babies may want to conduct their own experiment with this approach.

## Reframing the Traditional Culture Observation

The observation that traditional cultures have less colic has typically been attributed to their practice of holding babies more. However, Donella proposes an alternative hypothesis: **the difference may be in the vitamin and mineral content of the mothers' and babies' bodies**, not in the holding behavior.

Dr. Markham acknowledges this is "entirely possible" while noting that "everything we know about traditional cultures doesn't support" the idea that they are nutritionally better off. She concedes that "it may well be that it isn't the holding that prevents the colic in those cultures" - suggesting the causal mechanism remains genuinely uncertain.

## Key Takeaways for Parents

1. **Holding alone may not prevent or cure colic** - parents should not blame themselves if their baby has colic despite constant holding and attention

2. **Consider biological causes**: Nutritional deficiencies, gut bacteria imbalances, and food sensitivities may be more relevant than parenting behaviors

3. **Practical interventions to try**:
   - Eliminate cow's milk from breastfeeding mother's diet
   - Try probiotic supplementation (L. reuteri specifically mentioned)
   - Consider magnesium and B-6 supplementation (though specific dosing was not provided)

4. **The condition may have hereditary components** - if a parent had colic, their child may be more susceptible

5. **Colic is not a failure of parenting** - the case study demonstrates that even extraordinary levels of holding, responsiveness, and attentiveness cannot guarantee prevention
