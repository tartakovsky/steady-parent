## Defining True Bullying

**Bullying** is not the same as a one-time conflict, hurtful comment, or occasional teasing. All children will sometimes be teased or feel left out, but true bullying has specific characteristics:

- **Intentional** - the aggressor means to cause harm
- **Repeated** - it happens more than once
- **Abuse of power** - there's a real or perceived power imbalance

The power can take different forms: physical strength, access to embarrassing information, or popularity. The bully uses this power to control or harm others.

Bullying manifests in multiple forms: spreading rumors, name-calling, exclusion, threats, or physical aggression.

## Why Children Bully

Every human needs to feel powerful in their lives. When children don't have access to healthy sources of power - like autonomy, mastery, and connection - they seek power in unhealthy ways. If a child feels powerless or emotionally overwhelmed, bullying becomes a way to gain control.

**Many children who bully are themselves hurting.** They've often been humiliated, threatened, or mistreated, and they displace those feelings onto someone else. This creates a cycle: kids who are hurting often hurt other kids.

## The Limits of Bully-Proofing

You cannot fully bully-proof your child. There will always be people who are hurting and lash out, and your child's path will sometimes cross with theirs. It's also developmentally normal for kids to experiment with power dynamics, especially before they've fully developed empathy.

**The real goal is not to shield your child from every instance of unkindness, but to help them develop two things:**
1. The skills to respond with confidence
2. The willingness to reach out when they need help

## The Systemic Nature of Bullying

Bullying can begin as early as preschool and often intensifies in middle school. Studies show 40% to 80% of middle schoolers admit to participating in bullying at some point. Many describe themselves as both victims and aggressors. This tells us something crucial: bullying is often systemic, not just individual.

**Punishment doesn't work.** Research shows that restorative justice circles, conflict resolution training, and transforming the school culture have all proven more effective at reducing bullying than targeting bullies with punishment.

## The Cyberbullying Dimension

With social media, bullying can follow children home, eroding their sense of safety even in their own bedrooms. Research links cyberbullying to rising rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide. Long-term consequences of bullying include higher risk for depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse, and self-destructive behavior.

## Strategy 1: Model Compassionate, Respectful Relationships From the Start

Children learn how relationships work by watching how you treat them and others. The modeling happens in two directions:

- If you use power over your child, they learn to either use power over others OR allow others to use power over them
- If you model respectful communication and set limits with empathy, children learn that relationships don't require domination or submission, and that they deserve to be treated with dignity

**Physical punishment is strongly linked to later bullying behaviors.** If you spank, your child learns that physical violence is the way to respond to interpersonal problems. Research has repeatedly established this connection.

Any discipline methods that use power over a child teach them to use power over others or let others use power over them. Children often perceive punishment as adults using force to get their way, which teaches them that bullying is acceptable.

As Alice Miller wrote: "If children have been accustomed from the start to having their world respected, they will have no trouble later in life recognizing disrespect... and will rebel against it on their own."

## Strategy 2: Stay Connected Through Thick and Thin

**Lonely kids are more likely to be bullied.** Kids are often ashamed that they're being bullied, making them hesitant to tell their parents. If your child knows you will always listen and have their back, they're more likely to talk with you about things that upset them.

How do you ensure your child would tell you if they were being bullied? **Connection is the foundation.** It's described as "the 80% that makes the other 20% of guidance stick." When your child feels seen and supported:
- They're more likely to talk to you
- They're more likely to believe in their own self-worth

## Strategy 3: Model Confident, Respectful Assertiveness

Your own behavior teaches your child about assertiveness. Two problematic patterns to avoid:

1. **Aggressive response**: If you lose your temper and curse out other drivers, even from the privacy of your own car, you teach your child that sometimes it's okay to disrespect other people

2. **Passive response**: If you back down easily to avoid making a scene but then seethe silently, your child learns those strategies too

**Healthy assertiveness looks like:** calm, clear, respectful communication, even when you disagree.

## Strategy 4: Directly Teach Respectful Self-Assertion

Kids need to know they can get their needs met while being respectful of other people. Give your child simple, powerful scripts for everyday use:

- "It's my turn now."
- "Hey, stop that."
- "Hands off my body."
- "It's not okay to hurt."
- "I don't like being called that. I want you to call me by my name."

## Strategy 5: Build Social Skills Through Play and Coaching

**Bullies often target kids who seem isolated or unsure.** If your child has social challenges, support them in building confidence, but not by pushing them into uncomfortable situations. Instead, practice together:

- Roleplay joining games
- Navigate playground dynamics in rehearsal
- Practice introducing themselves

**Observe how your child interacts with peers and offer gentle coaching.** One specific skill: kids who are successful in joining groups of kids usually observe first and find a way to fit into the group, rather than just barging in. This may need practice.

**Help children listen to their inner guidance about which friendships feel safe and respectful.** Sometimes kids want peer acceptance so much that they continue hanging around a group even when one of the group leaders begins to mistreat them. Listen to what your child says about peer interactions to help them learn to check in with their own inner wisdom, and work to provide healthy relationship opportunities.

## Strategy 6: Teach How Bullying Dynamics Work

**Bullies are testing for a reaction.** If the aggression gives the bully what they're looking for - a feeling of power from successfully pushing the other child's buttons - the aggression will generally escalate. But if the "target" stays calm, the bully often loses interest.

**Key teaching point:** Since every bully is looking for a reaction, the calmer your child stays, the more likely the bully will stop their provocation.

**Timing is critical:** Discuss this with every child BEFORE they might be subject to bullying, so they can stand up for themselves successfully when a bully first "tests" them. When children understand the why behind bullying behavior, they can respond without taking it personally and without reacting in ways that escalate the situation.

## Strategy 7: Practice with Roleplays

Role-playing prepares your child to respond to teasing and provocations. Key concepts to communicate during practice:

- The bully wants to provoke a response that makes the bully feel powerful
- Showing emotion and fighting back are exactly what the bully feeds off
- While your child can't control the bully, they can always control their own response
- In every interaction, how they respond will either inflame or defuse the situation
- Your child needs to avoid getting "hooked" no matter how mad the bully makes them

**The best strategy maintains everyone's dignity:** keep your own dignity while withdrawing from the situation, and don't attack or demean the other person.

**Physical and verbal components to practice:**
- Stand tall
- Make eye contact
- Use a strong voice
- Count to ten to stay calm
- Say something calm like:
  - "You know, I'm just going to ignore that comment."
  - "I think I have something else to do right now."
  - "No thank you."
- Then just walk away

**Practice until your child has a strong, self-assured tone.**

## Strategy 8: Supervise Early Technology Use

Bullying on social media is still an abuse of power, but there are differences from in-person bullying. Kids who wouldn't be likely to engage in unkindness to someone's face may be able to ignore the impact of their actions online, making it harder to resist bullying.

**When your child first begins to use social media, review it with them daily.** Maintain an attitude of curiosity, support, and humor. Ask your child:
- How they felt about their various interactions
- What was hard
- How they decided what to do

Children develop good judgment from interactions where they have a chance to safely reflect on the choices they made and what happened.

**Reflective questions to ask:**
- "What was fun about your online time today?"
- "Did anything feel confusing or upsetting?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"

**Concrete cyber safety rules to teach:**
- Never share your passwords, even with friends
- Review privacy settings regularly with your parents
- Do not share anything that could hurt or embarrass anyone
- Never forward anything that could be hurtful
- Being kind to others online will help keep you safe
- Being mean online or forwarding hurtful messages is just like being mean or spreading hurtful rumors or embarrassing someone in person
- Always come to a parent right away if something online makes you uncomfortable

**When cyberbullying occurs, you have an advantage: documentation exists.**
Steps to take:
1. Document everything with screenshots and dates
2. Block the person
3. Report it to the school with documentation

## Strategy 9: Remove the Shame From Walking Away

Teach your child that there is no shame in:
- Being frightened by a bully
- Walking away
- Telling an adult and asking for help

Bullying situations can escalate, and saving face is less important than staying safe.

## Strategy 10: Teach Bystander Intervention

**Bystander intervention is highly effective.** Bullying expert Michele Borba reports that when bystanders intervene correctly, studies find they can stop bullying more than half the time and within 10 seconds.

Empower your child to be a **defender**, not a bystander.

**Best intervention strategies:**

**Partner with the victim and remove them from danger:**
- Go stand with the victim physically
- Turn the victim away from the bully
- Walk them off in the other direction toward adult help
- Use phrases like: "You look upset" or "I've been looking for you" or "The teacher sent me to find you"

**Get help and recruit other bystanders:**
- Bullies love an audience, so get the other kids on your side
- Wave them over, yelling "We need your help"
- Confront the bully: "You're being mean"
- Then walk away with the group: "C'mon, let's go!"

**For safety concerns:** shout for a teacher or dial 911 on a cell phone.

## Strategy 11: Teach Basic Bully Avoidance

**Bullies operate where adults aren't present.** If your child has been bullied, they should avoid unsupervised areas:
- Unsupervised hallways
- Bathrooms
- Areas of the playground without adult supervision

**Specific positioning strategies:**
- Sit in the front of the school bus
- Stand in the front of the line
- Sit at a lunch table near the cafeteria chaperones

## Strategy 12: Don't Hesitate to Intervene as a Parent

Your job as the parent is to protect your child. In addition to teaching your child to stick up for themselves, you may need to call the teacher or principal.

**Even if your child begs you not to tell the school:**
- Document everything
- Advocate fiercely

**Emotional bullying and exclusion can be just as damaging as physical aggression.** If the school doesn't take it seriously, escalate. Options include:
- Requesting a safety plan
- Transferring schools
- Homeschooling if necessary
