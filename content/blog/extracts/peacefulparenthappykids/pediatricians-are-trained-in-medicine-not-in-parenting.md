# When Pediatricians Give Unsolicited Parenting Advice

Source: https://www.peacefulparenthappykids.com/read/pediatricians-are-trained-in-medicine-not-in-parenting

## Core Principle: Medical Training Does Not Equal Parenting Expertise

**Pediatricians have almost no psychological training.** They are trained in medicine and physical health, not in child psychology or discipline practices. This means they are "way out of their league" when giving psychological or parenting advice.

The implication: Parents should not automatically defer to pediatricians on matters of discipline, emotional development, or parenting approaches simply because of their medical authority. Their expertise has clear boundaries.

## How to Respond to Unwanted Parenting Advice from Doctors

### The Recommended Response Script

When a pediatrician pushes discipline advice, use this approach:

1. **Politely redirect**: "We've got that all covered. I am very happy with my approach, thank you."
2. **Refocus on their actual expertise**: "Anything we need to know about how he's doing physically?"

This response accomplishes several things:
- It does not engage in debate or justification
- It establishes a clear boundary without being confrontational
- It redirects the conversation to the pediatrician's actual area of competence

### If the Doctor Persists

If the pediatrician pushes further despite the initial redirect:
- Point out that just as healthcare has made huge advances in the past thirty years based on constant research, **psychological understanding of children has also advanced significantly**
- Suggest they read current research-based parenting literature
- Consider bringing a well-respected parenting book to appointments as a reference

## Understanding the Parent-Doctor Relationship

### What Pediatricians Can and Cannot Require

**Key insight**: A pediatrician cannot refuse to see your child as long as you are "compliant" with any physical prescriptions they give you.

Pediatric duties are limited to physical health. A doctor **has no right to impose discipline practices** because discipline falls outside their medical responsibilities entirely.

### Trusting Your Own Judgment

The article raises a thought-provoking question: **"Why would you take any expert's word against your own intuition and experience?"**

The metaphor offered: Deferring to a pediatrician on parenting is "like letting the waiter eat your dinner." The waiter (pediatrician) has a role in the experience, but consuming the meal (raising the child) is not their job.

## Context: When Gentle Parenting Is Questioned

This advice emerged from a situation where:
- A parent had successfully used gentle parenting for 12 years with positive results
- A new pediatrician began lecturing about using "negative consequences" with a one-year-old
- The doctor was skeptical of gentle methods

The parent's experience demonstrates an important point: **gentle parenting approaches that work well may still be questioned by professionals unfamiliar with the research or methodology.** This does not mean the approach is wrong.

## Warning: The Pressure to Conform

The emotional weight of having a medical professional question your parenting can be significant. The article acknowledges this ("If that is hard for you, then that is valuable information for you").

The underlying message: Difficulty in standing up to authority figures on parenting matters may indicate an opportunity for personal growth in trusting your own experience and research over outside opinions, even from experts in adjacent fields.
