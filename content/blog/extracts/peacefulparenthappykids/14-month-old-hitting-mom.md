## Core Principle: Hitting Is a Cry for Help, Not Misbehavior

When a 14-month-old hits a parent, this behavior is not evidence of a "bad" or "mean" child. The hitting is a **cry for help** - the baby has big feelings that overwhelm her underdeveloped brain and nervous system, and she needs parental assistance to handle those emotions. Understanding this fundamental truth shapes the entire response strategy.

**Why babies hit:** Babies are sensitive people who must handle an overload of intense feelings throughout their days - pain from teething, disappointment that feels like the end of the world to them. Their brain and nervous systems are not developed enough to manage these feelings gracefully, so they resort to more primitive methods of expression, such as hitting.

## The Emotional Mechanics Behind Hitting

### The Anger-Vulnerability Connection

**Underneath all human anger are more vulnerable feelings:** hurt, fear, and pain. All of these feelings make us feel powerless - and if adults struggle with powerlessness, imagine how overwhelming it feels for a baby. Humans find these vulnerable feelings so hard to tolerate that we defend against them by feeling anger instead. Babies are no exception: when they feel pain, hurt, or fear, babies get angry, just like adults do.

This means that when a 14-month-old hits, she is not primarily expressing anger - she is **defending against** the deeper feelings of disappointment, pain, or fear that she cannot tolerate. The hitting is the visible symptom; the vulnerable feelings underneath are the actual issue that needs to be addressed.

### What "Acting Out" Actually Means

**"Acting out" means:** instead of feeling our emotions, we act them out. The hitting is the "acting out" - the child is converting internal emotional distress into external physical behavior because she cannot yet process the feelings directly.

## The Correct Response: Firm Kindness Without Punishment

### What to Do (The Recommended Approach)

The correct response has two simultaneous components:

1. **Stop the hitting immediately** - Hitting is not something that should ever be permitted. You do not want to model a relationship where hitting is ever okay, no matter what feelings your child has. So you stop her immediately and firmly.

2. **Respond with kindness, not discipline** - Because the child is hitting as a cry for help, not out of malice, the response should not be punitive. The child needs help handling her emotions, not punishment for failing to handle them.

### Why Firm Kindness Works

When a parent stops the hitting firmly and really means it, the baby often stops hitting. **The key factor is parental clarity and confidence in the limit.** When parents are ambivalent - wondering if they should not hurt the baby's feelings - the hitting continues because the limit is not clear to the child.

### The Sign That You're Doing It Right

When you use "gentle guidance" to say "we don't hit" and the child's face crumples and she starts crying, **this is a great sign, not a failure.** The crumpling face means you have gotten past the anger to the feelings beneath it. Feeling and expressing those deeper "bad" feelings is exactly what she needs at that moment to get to the source of her acting-out behavior.

## Why Punishment and Anger Make Things Worse

### The Anger Response Backfires

If a parent responds to hitting with anger, the child would **never get to those deeper feelings.** Instead, she would stay angry. The defensive anger remains in place because the child never feels safe enough to access the vulnerable feelings underneath.

### An Even Worse Outcome: Defensive Smiling

Another possible result of parental anger: to keep the parent's anger in check, the child may **begin smiling while she hits.** This smile is another defense against the painful feelings - a way of disconnecting from the emotional reality of the situation. Either way - continued anger or defensive smiling - the hitting is more likely to continue when parents respond with anger or punishment.

## The Four-Step Sequence for Responding to Hitting

Dr. Markham provides a specific sequence:

### Step 1: Set a Limit

Use clear, simple language: **"We don't hit"** or **"No hitting mommy"**

The limit should be firm and clear. Ambivalence about setting the limit undermines its effectiveness.

### Step 2: Offer Empathy and Acceptance of Feelings

Give the child words for her feelings so she won't have to act them out. Important: **she doesn't have to be able to say the words herself - she just has to hear that you are understanding her.**

Example phrases:
- "You are so sad; you wanted that."
- "You can be as mad as you want, but I won't let you hit me."
- "You feel so sad and mad."

The empathy serves a critical function: it creates **safety** for the child to feel her feelings. Without feeling safe, she cannot access the vulnerable emotions underneath the anger.

### Step 3: Let Her Discharge Her Feelings by Crying With Your Comfort

When the child then cries and you hold her, she is expressing those "yucky" feelings in the safety of your arms and your love. **She's learning two things simultaneously:**
1. She can't always have everything she wants (like that dangerous object you just took from her)
2. She can have something even more important - someone who adores her and accepts all of her, including those "negative" feelings

**This unconditional love is the greatest gift any child can receive, and the foundation of all emotional health.**

### Step 4: Help Her Explore Ways to Shift Her Mood

Once your daughter has "shown you" her upset, let her know that her happiness matters to you, even though you can't say yes. **This is how children learn that we love them, even though we frustrate them with limits.**

Example transition phrases:
- "Let's find a way to feel better."
- "Should we dance to some music?"
- "Look out the window?"
- "Turn on the faucet and put our hands in the water?"

## Why Crying Is Healthy and Necessary

### The Danger of Distraction

**Warning: Distracting a child from her feelings to stop her from crying sets up a destructive pattern for later life.** This pattern can manifest as using food, shopping, or alcohol to avoid feelings in adulthood. The child learns that uncomfortable feelings should be escaped rather than experienced.

### The Healing Power of Feeling Feelings

**The amazing thing about human emotion is that once we allow ourselves to feel them, they dissipate.** The disappointment, sadness, and powerlessness go away once the child feels safe enough to feel them. Then she doesn't need to get mad as a way to defend against those more vulnerable feelings, and the anger melts away too.

This is the mechanism by which the four-step sequence actually works: by creating safety for the child to feel her vulnerable feelings, you allow those feelings to complete their natural cycle and dissipate, which removes the need for the defensive anger, which removes the need for the hitting.

### Crying Is Part of the Solution

**It is perfectly okay for a child to cry about her disappointment, as long as you're offering her comfort.** Sometimes crying is exactly what we need. The crying is the discharge mechanism - the way the feelings are processed and released.

## Why This Approach Builds Emotional Health for Life

The sequence of firm limits combined with empathy and comfort teaches several foundational lessons:

1. **Limits exist, but they don't mean you're unloved** - The child learns that parents can frustrate them with limits while still loving them completely.

2. **Negative feelings are acceptable** - The child learns that someone adores her and accepts all of her, including her "negative" feelings.

3. **Feelings can be tolerated and will pass** - The child learns that vulnerable feelings, while uncomfortable, can be experienced safely and will dissipate.

4. **There are healthy ways to handle difficult emotions** - Rather than acting out (hitting) or numbing (distraction/avoidance), there is a path through the feelings.

**If you can follow this sequence, you are giving your daughter a foundation of emotional health for life.**

## Common Patterns and What They Indicate

### Pattern: Hitting is worse when child wants something she can't have or something is taken away

This is consistent with the framework. The disappointment of not getting something feels like the end of the world to a baby, triggering the vulnerable feelings that lead to defensive anger and hitting.

### Pattern: Hitting is worse when child is not feeling well (e.g., teething)

Pain is one of the core vulnerable feelings that triggers defensive anger. More physical discomfort means more vulnerable feelings to manage, which means more potential for hitting when the child's limited emotional regulation capacity is overwhelmed.

### Pattern: Child's face crumples and she cries after being told not to hit

This indicates the child has moved past the defensive anger to the vulnerable feelings beneath. This is the desired outcome - the feelings can now be processed and discharged through crying with comfort.
