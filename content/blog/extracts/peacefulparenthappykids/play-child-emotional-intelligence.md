# Play as a Tool for Connection and Emotional Intelligence

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids

## Core Principle: Why Play Matters

**The central claim**: Five minutes of play that gets your child laughing is one of the best ways you can spend time with your child. This is not said lightly because play serves a critical biological and emotional function.

### The Emotional Backpack Theory

Children face an avalanche of stressful feelings from normal daily life:
- Fear (What if there IS something under the bed?)
- Anger (But it was my turn! That's not fair!)
- Jealousy (Maybe you do love their sibling more!)
- Humiliation (The teacher acted like he should already know that, and all the kids laughed!)
- Panic (What if they don't make it to the bathroom on time? What if they have a pop quiz when they've been spending time on Minecraft instead of studying?)
- Disappointment (Doesn't anyone care what I want?!)

When children cannot work through these emotions as they arise, the emotions get **stuffed into the "emotional backpack"** (otherwise known as the body). This creates a cascade of problems:
- More tension builds up looking for release
- More stress hormones circulate in the bloodstream
- The child becomes cranky, rigid, and reactive
- Basically, a pain to live with

### Nature's Release Valve

**Laughter transforms body chemistry** by reducing stress hormones and increasing bonding hormones. This is why nature designed children with a built-in release valve: play, especially play that triggers laughter.

Play is one of the main ways small humans process emotions. All mammals play because it's their way of learning skills they'll need when they're full-grown, from finding food to getting along with others. Play releases tension and helps children work through the big emotions that arise as they tackle new challenges.

### The Physical Component

Kids are more physical than adults. When they get wound up emotionally, their bodies need to discharge all that energy. This is one reason children have so much more energy than adults and wear us out.

**The payoff of physical games**: When we play physical games with children, they giggle and sweat and scream, and they release the same pent-up stress hormones that they'd otherwise have to tantrum to discharge. Physical play provides an alternative outlet to tantrums.

## Play as a Healing Tool

### The Oxytocin Connection

Because laughter triggers the release of **oxytocin**, play that gets both people laughing helps parents and kids feel closer. This matters because feeling close is required for having influence with your child.

### Learning Through Play

Play is how kids learn, so when you "teach" an emotional lesson by playing, your child really gets it. This makes play superior to lecturing or explaining for emotional lessons.

### Issue-Specific Healing

If your child is struggling with a specific issue, you can often help them work through that issue using play. Whether the issue is:
- Separation anxiety
- Sibling rivalry
- Feeling needy
- Feeling powerless
- Feeling unloved

**The healing mechanism**: If you can get your child laughing about an issue, that's the beginning of healing it.

## Overcoming Parent Resistance to Play

### Reframing "Hating Play"

Many parents feel exhausted at the end of the day and believe they hate playing with their child. The reframe:
- What if you set a timer and forget about your To-Do list and just connect for five minutes?
- What if doing this regularly makes your child more cooperative?
- What if it makes you feel more energized?
- What if five minutes of play every evening helps you become a happier parent?

### Why Play Energizes Parents

The tension and irritation we carry around makes us tired. When we play, we discharge stress hormones just like our kids, giving us a little more energy for the task of moving kids through the schedule. Most parents find these games energizing, not draining.

### Time Requirements

These games don't have to last long:
- Maybe 10 minutes at most
- Can be as little as 2 minutes
- Five minutes is a reasonable starting point

### Making a Deal with Your Child

When your child asks you to play (dollhouse, build a train track, etc.), make a deal: Sure, you'll play that, but first, will they play a roughhousing game with you for a few minutes? Don't be surprised if your child loves this kind of play so much they begin begging for these games over and over.

## Games for Specific Situations

### When Your Child is Annoying, In Your Face, or Teasing Siblings

**The underlying need**: We dismiss "She just wants attention" as if that's not a legitimate need. But every child sometimes NEEDS reassurance of your love. This annoying behavior may be the only way they know to show you that need. You can fill that need and transform the entire day.

**The Long Hug technique**:
1. Say: "Are you out of hugs again? Let's do something about that!"
2. Grab your child and give her a LONG hug, as long as you can
3. Don't loosen your grip until she begins to squirm
4. When she squirms, don't let go immediately
5. Hug harder and say: "I LOVE hugging you! I never want to let go. Promise I can hug you again soon?"
6. Then let go and connect with a big, warm smile
7. Say: "Thank you! I needed that!"

### The Fix Game (More Intensive Version)

**Use when**: A child has a new sibling, or you've been doing a lot of disciplining.

**Purpose**: Convince your child on a very deep level that you LOVE him.

**How to play**:
1. Chase him
2. Hug and kiss him
3. Let him get away
4. Repeat again and again

**Sample script**: "I need my Michael.... You can't get away... I have to hug you and cover you with kisses.... Oh, no, you got away... I'm coming after you.... I just have to kiss you more and hug you more....You're too fast for me.... But I'll never give up... I love you too much...I got you.... Now I'll kiss your toes.... Oh, no, you're too strong for me... But I will always want more Michael hugs...."

**Why it works**: This game is guaranteed to transform your child's doubt about whether he's truly loved. Any child who is "misbehaving" harbors that doubt. Called the "Fix" game because it Fixes whatever's wrong.

**Parent testimonial**: "I'm kind of shocked how much my son is loving the Fix game!? I don't think I've ever heard my son say, 'Let's do it again!' so many times :)"

### Two-Parent Variation

Fight over your child (jokingly), vying to see who can snatch him up and hug him.

**Sample script**: "I want him!' 'No, I want him!' 'But I NEED him so much!' 'No, I need him! You ALWAYS get him!'"

### The NO! Game (When Your Child is Grumpy)

**The script**: "You seem to be in a NO! mood. I have an idea. I want to hear you say NO! as much as you want. I will say YES!, and you can answer NO! in the same tone of voice. So when I say YES! in this low voice, you say NO! in a low voice. When I say YES! in this squeaky voice, you say NO! in this squeaky voice. Okay?"

### When Your Child is Over-Excited or Too Revved Up

**Opening**: "You have so much energy right now. What can we do with all this energy? Do you want to spin around? Come over here (or outside) with me where it's safe to spin around, and I'll spot you."

**The process**:
1. Find a safe place where no other kids or parents are there to further stimulate him
2. Let him spin around, or jump up and down, or run in circles around you, whatever he chooses
3. When he drops in exhaustion, snuggle him

**The teaching moment script**: "It's so much fun to be excited. But sometimes you get over-excited and you need a little help to calm down. Now, let's take three deep breaths to relax. In through the nose, out through the mouth. 1.....2......3......Good! Do you feel a little calmer? It's good to know how to calm yourself down. Now, let's go snuggle by ourselves and read a book for a bit."

**Key elements**:
- Acknowledge that excitement is fun
- Teach that sometimes you need help calming down
- Practice the calming technique together (three deep breaths)
- Validate learning self-regulation as a valuable skill
- Transition to quiet activity

### When You're Having Lots of Power Struggles

**Core principle**: Give your child the chance to be the more powerful one and to outsmart and overpower a terrible monster: You!

**Game variations**:

1. **The Bumbling Monster**: Swagger and strut and roar at your child about how you will catch him and show him who's boss. But when you chase him, always trip and bumble and let him outsmart you or overpower you and get away.

2. **The Remote Control**: Give her a remote and pretend she can make you stop, start, move forward and backward.

3. **The Powerful High-Five**: When she high-fives you, pretend she almost knocked you over.

4. **The Knockdown Game**: Give your child a feather, or a pillow, to hit you with. Every time he hits you, fall over! Repeat as long as he's giggling. Acknowledge your child's formidable power: "You are so strong! You pushed me right over!"

### When Your Child is Cheating at a Game

**Response**: "Looks like we have new rules now.... But how come you always win?!... I HATE losing!"

**Key**: Overdo your role as the "sore loser" so that your child gets to laugh at you.

### When Your Child is Super-Clingy or Has Separation Anxiety

**The role reversal**: Cling to your child, being super-exaggerated and silly.

**Sample script**: "I know you want me to let go so you can go play, but I NEED you! I only want to be with you. PLEASE be with me now?"

**Physical component**: Keep holding your child's hand or clinging to their clothes.

**Why it works**:
- She will like the feeling that SHE is the one in charge of letting go, rather than feeling pushed away
- If you act silly enough, she will also giggle and let off some of the tension around goodbyes

**The ending**: When she definitively pushes you away, say: "It's ok. I know you will come back. We always come back to each other."

### When Your Child Only Wants Mommy (or Daddy)

**Setup**: Let the preferred parent sit on the couch. The non-preferred parent gets between the child and the preferred parent.

**The non-preferred parent boasts**: "You can't get to Mommy! You are all mine! Only I get to be with you! I will keep you from getting to Mommy!"

**The gameplay**:
1. As your child tries to get to Mommy, grab at him, but bumble and be unsuccessful
2. When he reaches Mommy, she laughs, cheers, hugs him and then lets him go
3. You lament that he got through, but continue to boast and challenge him and try to grab him
4. Exaggerate your boasting: "You can't push around me to get to Mommy!" and then bumble and let him push past you

**The healing mechanism**: He should giggle and giggle, which means that he is releasing his fears and anxieties.

### When Your Kids are Fighting a Lot

**Timing**: Do this when tempers are calm, not during the fight.

**The prompt**: "Would you two please fight with each other now?"

**The TV Commentator technique**: When they begin to fight, pretend to be a TV commentator.

**Sample script**: "We're on the scene tonight watching two sisters who can't seem to get along! Will they work things out or not? Stay with us while we observe this behavior live! Notice how big sister is bossy, but little sister is provocative! Both girls want the same piece of salami! Can they work this out? Are they smart enough to realize there's more salami in the fridge? Stay tuned..."

**The result**: If you catch this before tempers get too hot, you can transform insults into giggles and completely defuse the tension.

### When Your Child Feels Like a Bottomless Pit

**The prescription**: Every day, spend 15 minutes snuggling. Revel in touching your child. Don't structure this time.

**What to do**:
- Kiss him on the nose
- Nuzzle her hair
- Let him sink into the comfort of your lap
- Even if your kid is eight, treat him as if he's a baby, just beginning to be verbal
- Rock him in your arms
- Play the physical games you played when she was tiny

**What to avoid**: Resist tickling, which can make kids feel invaded and out of control.

**Enhancement**: Look together at old baby pictures: "You were so adorable, almost as adorable as you are now!"

### When Your Child is Whining a Lot

**Understanding the root cause**: Whining is an expression of powerlessness.

**What NOT to do**: Refusing to "hear" until they use a "big kid" voice further invalidates them.

**What also NOT to do**: Don't "give in" to whining and reward it.

**The solution**: Express confidence that your child can use her "strong" voice and offer your assistance to help her find it, by making it into a game.

**Sample script**: "Hey, where did your strong voice go? It was here a minute ago. I LOVE your strong voice! I'll help you find it. Help me look. Is it under the chair? No...In the toy box? No.... HEY! You found it!! That was your strong voice!! Yay! I love your strong voice! Now, tell me again what you need, in your strong voice."

**If this doesn't work**: It's because your child needs more tenderness and maybe a chance to cry.

### To Help Your Child Fall Asleep at Night

**The technique**: Say goodnight to each part of your child's body, touching each part in turn gently, with a little massage.

**Sample script**: "Good night shoulder... good night arm.... good night elbow, good night forearm, good night wrist, good night hand, good night fingers."

**How to do it**: Take your time so your child relaxes each part of her body as you "recognize" it.

**Why it works**: The more you can simply relax and connect with your child, the more you are helping your child be fully present in her body, which helps her let go of tension and relax.

### When Your Child Has Stolen Something

**The dual approach**: Yes, you need to have a conversation, but you also need to help through play.

**The conversation elements**:
- How he really wished he could have what he stole, so he took it
- He must never take things that don't belong to him
- Now he must return it, and you will go with him to support him
- In the future he can ask you if he wants something

**Why play is also needed**: Your child knew all that already. He succumbed to that fierce need that he thought he could fill by taking this thing that didn't even help him feel better. Now he is overcome with shame and anxiety. He needs your help to work that through before he can be brave enough to make amends.

**The play approach**: Get your child laughing by enacting a stuffed animal "stealing" things from all over the room. Meanwhile, the stuffed animal mother is searching for the stolen things: "I can't find the dog dish anywhere! Wherever did it go?!" Of course, the pile of stolen things is right in front of her.

**Purpose**: Help melt away the shame and fear, so your child can actually learn from this experience.

### When Your Child Has Been Screeching or Complaining

**The permission technique**:

**Sample script**: "Ok, there's been so much complaining (or loud screeching)! This is your last chance to complain (screech) for the rest of the day. I'm setting the timer and putting on my earphones. I want you to complain (screech) as loud as you can for the next three minutes. You only have three minutes so make the most of them. After that, we're all back to normal inside voices. 1, 2, 3, GO!"

### For Challenging Issues (Start of School, Playground Struggles, Being Sick)

**Stuffed animal roleplay**: Have one stuffed animal be the parent, and one be the child, and act out the situation.

**Why stuffed animals**: Using stuffed animals removes it one step from reality so most kids find it more comfortable. However, some children prefer to act the situation out themselves.

**Sample prompts**:
- "Let's pretend we're in the sandbox and I want your truck but you don't want to share"
- "Let's pretend you're the teacher and I'm the student"
- "Let's pretend you're the doctor and I'm sick"

**Why it works**: Playing out these situations that cause so much stress helps children feel more in control of their own emotions, and lets them be the powerful one in a situation where they might have felt powerless and humiliated in real life.

### For Recurring Problems (Dawdling in the Morning or at Bedtime)

**Setup**: Grab a mom and baby stuffed animal.

**Step 1**: Have them act out the morning (or bedtime) routine. Have the little one resist, whine, collapse. Have the mom "lose it" but don't scare your child by overdoing it. Have the mom be a funny, incompetent bumbler. Your child will be fascinated.

**Step 2**: Hand your kid the "mom" and play out the scenario again, with you being the kid.

**Key elements**:
- Make it funny so you can both giggle and let off tension
- Include absurd scenarios: the kid goes to school in his pjs, the mom goes to work in her pjs, the kid has to yell at the mom to hurry up and get ready

**Sample absurd script**: "Who cares about that meeting? Let's tell the boss it's more important to find your toy car!"

**The principle**: Give him in fantasy what he can't have in reality.

**Benefits**:
- You may learn something about how to make things work better
- At minimum, you'll defuse the tension so you'll see more understanding and cooperation on Monday
- Bonus: It's a great window to see how your kid perceives you!

### To Reconnect

**Game options**:
- Start a pillow fight
- Start a snowball fight
- Wrestling game in which you take each other's socks off (an excuse for hugs)
- Give your child a pillow to hold, and try to steal it from her

**Critical rule**: Always let your child win.

**The indicator of success**: As long as your child is laughing, that game is working to alleviate anxiety and increase well-being.

**Expect repetition**: Don't be surprised if your child wants to play these games over and over. They relieve stress, help your child master emotion, and believe it or not, they're fun!

## Key Principles Across All Games

### The Laughter Indicator

As long as your child is laughing, the game is working. Laughter is the signal that stress hormones are being released and healing is happening.

### Power Reversal

Many games involve putting the child in the powerful position while the parent plays the incompetent, bumbling, or defeated role. This helps children who feel powerless in their daily lives.

### Exaggeration and Silliness

Being exaggerated and silly is a feature, not a bug. It creates the safety and humor that allows children to giggle and release tension.

### Physical Contact and Touch

Many games incorporate hugging, holding, and physical touch as part of the healing mechanism. Physical closeness releases bonding hormones and provides the reassurance children need.

### Fantasy Fulfillment

Give children in fantasy what they can't have in reality. This helps process feelings about things they can't control.
