## Summary
A parent asks Dr. Laura Markham for advice about their 13-year-old son who resists daily piano practice despite years of lessons. The parent has tried making practice more enjoyable with fun pieces but the resistance continues. Dr. Laura provides perspective on the developmental timing and offers several alternative approaches.

## Key Concepts

### Piano Practice Resistance is Developmentally Normal
- Most children do not willingly practice piano because it requires sustained hard work with constantly increasing difficulty
- Puberty is the typical age when most kids give up piano
- Many who quit during adolescence report regretting it later

### The Mastery vs. Motivation Dilemma
- Working through difficulties while pursuing mastery builds resilience and confidence
- However, this benefit only applies when the child is internally motivated and passionate
- For most children taking piano lessons, it was originally the parents' idea, not theirs
- External motivation (parent-driven) is less effective than intrinsic motivation

### Child Autonomy in Adolescence
- At 13, children should be pursuing their own passions rather than their parents'
- If piano hasn't become personally rewarding after years of practice, it may be time to explore other interests

## Practical Recommendations

1. **Explore the child's own interests**: Identify what genuinely matters to the teen - sports, art, writing, or other activities
2. **Leverage existing musical foundation**: Consider transitioning to another instrument (like guitar) that might spark more enthusiasm
3. **Offer a challenge**: Tell the child they can switch instruments if they find something they love more than piano
4. **Consider changing teachers**: An inspiring teacher can transform a child's motivation - some teachers naturally make students want to practice

## Parenting Insights

- The goal should be avoiding resentment while also helping the child develop through meaningful challenge
- Forcing practice risks creating negative associations with music
- Supporting a child's own passion is more valuable than maintaining an activity chosen by parents
- The investment in piano isn't wasted - it can serve as foundation for other musical pursuits

## Themes
- Adolescent development and autonomy
- Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation
- Building resilience through mastery
- Respecting children's individual interests
- Flexible parenting approaches
