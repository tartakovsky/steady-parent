## Core Philosophy and Why This Matters

### The Fundamental Goal

The goal is not simply to inform children about biological mechanics, but to create **sexually healthy adults** who feel good about their bodies, can experience pleasure responsibly, and navigate intimate relationships well. Sexual health begins with enjoying the body and all its feelings, but since most people's sexual health will include interactions with others, it also depends on the ability to engage in intimacy and take responsibility for healthy interactions.

### Why Parents Must Talk About Sex Despite Discomfort

**Protection from abuse**: Giving children information about their bodies, sexuality, and family values protects them from abuse. Children who understand these topics can identify inappropriate behavior and are more likely to report it.

**You become the trusted resource**: If discussion of sex is too uncomfortable in your family, the child's takeaway will be that sex is shameful. The goal is to be the resource your child turns to when they have questions or worries. This is better than them getting information from peers, media, or pornography.

**Research evidence strongly supports this approach**:
- Comprehensive sex education programs significantly reduce risky sexual behaviors
- These programs delay onset of sexual activity, reduce numbers of partners, increase condom and contraceptive use, and decrease incidence of teen pregnancy and STIs including HIV (per American Academy of Pediatrics)
- States with "abstinence only" education have the highest rates of teen pregnancy, abortion, sexually transmitted disease, and HIV

### Key Teaching Goals Across All Ages

1. **Consent**: Teach children regardless of gender to say NO and to hear the No of others
2. **Remove shame**: Protect them from the cultural shame that surrounds sex
3. **Openness about sex**: Make sex something they know about and can come to parents about, which protects them from pornography and abuse
4. **Healthy body image**: This includes healthy sexual and gender identity
5. **Responsibility**: Raise children who will be responsible in their sexual activities as adults

## Foundational Principles for All Conversations

### Principle 1: Ongoing Small Conversations, Not "The Talk"

**What to avoid**: One big embarrassing talk out of the blue that you subject your child to as they hit puberty.

**What to do instead**: Have small conversations on an ongoing basis, as your child is ready for them. The earlier you begin, the easier it becomes. You lay the foundation for open discussion when your child is very young, a little at a time.

### Principle 2: Establish "Parent-Child" Discussion Boundaries

Tell your child that some discussions are "parent-child" discussions. These are things that each parent wants to talk to their own child about when they feel it's the right time. This means:
- These topics are always fine to discuss in your family
- They are not appropriate for your child to talk with other kids about
- Your home is a safe place for these discussions
- You always welcome any question

**Why this matters**: It avoids situations where your seven-year-old shows off sexual knowledge to peers and you hear from their parents or the teacher.

### Principle 3: Handle Resistance Gracefully

When your child doesn't want to discuss something ("Ooh, Mom, stop! That's gross!"):

1. Acknowledge their feelings: "Okay, I will keep this very short"
2. Assert your parental responsibility: "but it's my job as your parent to tell you this"
3. Explain your purpose: "I want you to feel ready for anything that you hear about, to hear it first from me"
4. Deliver the information calmly and warmly, with the same matter-of-fact tone you would use to discuss nutrition or food choices

**Timer technique**: Set a timer for two minutes and make it a game to finish your comment in time to ask if they have any questions, have ever heard of this before, or know anyone this happened to. If they say no, thank them for listening, hug them, and tell them you are always there if questions occur to them.

### Principle 4: Build Cumulatively

For each age group, make sure you have read and covered the information and approach from the earlier ages. The content builds upon itself.

## Age-by-Age Guide

### Babies

**Core developmental task**: Developing trust in physical interaction with another person and confidence in one's own agency over their body.

**What to do**: Talk to your baby as you touch their body. Narrate what you're doing to establish that physical interaction is communicative and respectful.

**Example language**: "Ready for your diaper change? Now I'll lift your legs up. Here's my hand cleaning you gently."

**Why this matters**: This establishes the foundation that their body belongs to them and that physical interactions should be communicated about openly.

---

### Toddlers

**Key understanding**: Your toddler is an explorer who takes delight in what they discover, including their body.

**Affirm body exploration**: Mirror their delight in body discovery just as you would with any other discovery. This removes stigma and shame.

**Example language**: "Touching your penis like that feels good, doesn't it?"

**Important context**: At this age, this is not really masturbation, but humans do feel pleasure in their sexual organs from very early in life. If they loved playing with their toes, you'd make a similar comment. The point is affirming self-exploration and removing stigma.

**Use correct anatomical names**: Every day, children learn from you that they have toes, a nose, a belly. They also need to know the correct names: vulva, clitoris, vagina, penis.

**Why correct names matter**:
- Imagine never using the correct word for the knee but referring to it only as "down there" - substantial shame would develop about this unnamed body part
- How would they communicate if something hurt?
- How would they tell you if someone touched them inappropriately?
- Correct names normalize these body parts and enable clear communication

### Three and Four-Year-Olds

**Answer questions as they arise**: If your child asks where babies come from, you might say "Babies grow inside their moms" and give examples of pregnant women they may have met. You don't need to go into full mechanics of sex unless your child asks follow-up questions.

**Establish boundaries around self-pleasure**: It's appropriate to establish healthy boundaries early about the context for self-pleasure.

**Example language**: "It feels good when you touch your penis doesn't it? That's wonderful, and it's private, so it's just for you. That means you do it in your own bedroom."

**Read books about emotions**: A healthy emotional life is at the heart of healthy sexuality. Books that help children develop emotional intelligence support sexual health.

**Teach body safety to prevent sexual abuse**:
- Teach that the part of their body under their bathing suit is special
- Some day they might use it to create a baby
- Because it is special, it is private
- No one touches them under their bathing suit, except a doctor if their parent is there and gives permission

**Gender identity awareness**: Some children identify as a gender different from the one assigned at birth, and they are often able to express this by age four. Gender identity does not depend on what body parts we have. Children need permission from their parents to be themselves, in all human variety.

### Five to Seven-Year-Olds

**Time for a real conversation**: If you haven't had a real conversation about sex and babies, it's time. Start with a good book about sex.

**Keep explanations simple but accurate**:

**Example language**: "The sperm and the egg join up, and a baby grows. Isn't that cool? Usually the sperm gets to the egg when the penis enters the vagina. It might sound strange to you, but that's because sex is not for kids. Sex feels good to grownup bodies."

**Teach consent**: We never touch anyone without their consent, and no one touches them without their consent.

**Frame sex within relationships**: Talk about sex as a part of healthy, loving relationships. Discuss what makes a good relationship.

**Begin talking about gender identity diversity**:

**Why so early**: Gender identity is already expressing itself, and children need support if they or someone they know does not fit social norms.

**Key concepts to explain**:
- Gender identity is who you feel yourself to be on the inside
- Most people identify with the gender they were born into, some do not
- Many children don't feel comfortable conforming to binary expressions of gender in appearance, behavior, mannerisms, and interests
- This may or may not have anything to do with gender identity or sexual orientation
- Example: A boy who likes to dress up as a princess will not necessarily later identify as a woman, or as gay
- Children need permission from their parents to be themselves

**Talk about diversity of sexual orientation**:

**Why so early**: Kids need to know that while most people are heterosexual, there is a range of sexual orientation, and that's okay. Sexual orientation is usually defined as who we are sexually attracted to.

**Example language**: "Uncle Tom and Uncle Billy are getting married. While most people like and marry people who are the opposite gender, some people like and marry people who are the same gender as they are. And some people don't want to get married at all!"

**Normalize masturbation**:
- Tell your child that masturbation feels good and is a way to love yourself
- It is private and should only be done in their own room
- **Important warning**: Children who masturbate very frequently are often using it to calm anxiety. Rather than intervening to stop masturbation done privately, address the underlying anxiety.

### Eight to Nine-Year-Olds

**Puberty education timing**: Average age for puberty to begin is now nine or ten years old. At ten or eleven, children may be more embarrassed, so even if your child shows no signs of puberty, it's great to start talking about it now.

**Framing language**: "I found this cool book for us to read together, about relationships and sex. I'm so glad that you're old enough now for us to have fun talking about this."

**Daughter-specific preparation**: Make sure your daughter knows about getting her period so it's not a shock. Discuss pads, tampons, and what to do when she finds blood on her panties, especially if you aren't around to help.

**Watch for modesty signals**: Be responsive to comments indicating your child feels more modest, such as:
- Asking to bathe without siblings
- Asking to bathe without you in the bathroom
- Looking uncomfortable when you are naked

**Tech controls**: Be sure your child has adequate media controls on all tech.

**Pornography education**: Statistically, most children stumble across pornography by age eight. Before that first exposure:
1. Ensure adequate parental controls on devices
2. Educate your child about pornography - what it is and how to respond to it

### Ten to Twelve-Year-Olds

**Revisit puberty discussions**: As puberty becomes more real to your child, revisit various aspects of it.

**Set expectations about sexual activity**: Teach your preteen that being a teenager does not mean they have to be sexually active. Express hope that they will wait to have sex until they're in a loving, long-term relationship.

**Talk about contraception**: This does not mean your child will run out and have sex. The goal is ensuring they know it's important to prevent pregnancy until they're ready for a child.

**Internet safety precautions**:
- Don't share personal information in public places (including age and location)
- Don't share passwords with friends
- Never share nude photos
- **Warning about pressure**: Many girls this age are pressured into sharing nude photos by a boy who professes his love. Talk with your child about what they would do in the face of such pressure.

**Keep home a safe place for all discussions**: As you continue discussing all previously introduced topics, share your values about love and sex with your child.

**Discussion questions to ask** (these create dialogue and reveal your child's thinking):

About love and relationships:
- At what age do you think people can fall in love?
- Do you think people should be married to have sex? If not, how should they decide whether they're ready?
- What do you think changes when you have sex?
- How do you think love and sex are different in real life than in the movies?
- What would be most important to you in looking for a romantic partner? What about a spouse?

About orientation and marriage:
- Do you think some day you'll date girls, or guys, or both (or neither)?
- At what age should people get married?
- Do you think you ever want to get married?
- How should you decide who to marry?
- Why do you think people get divorced?

About peers and social context:
- Do you think any of the kids at school have had sex? What do you think about that?
- Do kids at your school actually "date"?
- Do you know anyone who's gay or trans? Does anyone treat them differently? What do you think about that?

About gender and relationships:
- Do you think girls and guys have the same needs from sex and relationships?
- What do you think about the idea of "friends with benefits"?

About attraction and consent:
- If you are attracted to someone else, what do you think is the best way to show it?
- If someone wants to have sex with another person and they are too drunk to say yes or no, what should they do?
- What if someone says yes to sex but then changes their mind when they start?

### Thirteen Through the Teen Years

**Catch up if needed**: Re-visit suggestions for all previous ages to be sure you have covered everything. It's not too late!

**Ensure comprehensive knowledge**: Be sure your child knows all about safe sex, contraception, and sexually transmitted infections.

**Maintain ongoing discussions**: Have ongoing discussions, not one big talk. Ask what other kids are talking about related to sex and whether there's anything they're wondering about.

**Get comfortable with difficult topics**: Work hard to get comfortable answering questions about:
- Masturbation
- Nocturnal emissions
- Oral sex
- Anything else your child may ask about

**Why this matters**: This may seem impossible, but teens are so grateful when parents welcome their questions comfortably. They're much more likely to ask about things they're hearing when parents respond without discomfort.

**Your basic job is done**: Keep talking! Most important, keep listening!

## Important Awareness: Intersex Variations

**Frequency**: Although not often discussed, many children are born with sexual or reproductive anatomy that doesn't fit traditional definitions of female or male.

**Statistics**:
- About 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 2,000 births are noticeably atypical enough that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in
- Some estimates claim as many as 1 in 100 children are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life

**Key point**: There are a variety of ways for a body to be intersex, and parents should be aware this exists within normal human variation.
