## The Core Problem with Spanking: Children Learn the Wrong Lessons

The fundamental issue with spanking is not that children fail to learn from it - they do learn, but they learn things we do not intend to teach. This distinction is critical: spanking is not ineffective at teaching; it is effective at teaching the wrong things.

### Research Evidence on What Spanking Actually Teaches

**Spanking increases the very behaviors parents want to stop.** A large study by Straus, Sugarman, and Giles-Sims (1997) demonstrated that the more parents spanked children for antisocial behavior, the more that antisocial behavior increased. This creates a counterproductive cycle: the punishment intended to reduce bad behavior actually amplifies it.

**Spanking teaches children that hitting is acceptable when you have power over someone.** Children learn that it is okay to hit others who are smaller and weaker. This manifests in multiple ways:
- Children who are hit are more likely to hit peers and siblings (Straus and Gelles, 1990; Wolfe, 1987)
- As adults, they are more likely to hit their spouses (Straus and Gelles, 1990; Wolfe, 1987)

**The hypocrisy problem:** When a parent says "I'm going to hit you because you hit your sister," children recognize this contradiction. The message undermines itself because the parent is modeling the exact behavior they are trying to eliminate.

### Long-Term Mental Health Impact

**Even minimal spanking correlates with depression.** Studies by Strauss (1994) and Strassberg, Dodge, Pettit, and Bates (1994) found that even a few instances of being hit as children are associated with more depressive symptoms as adults. This is not about severe abuse - even occasional, "normal" spanking shows this correlation.

**Dr. Elizabeth Gershoff's landmark meta-analysis (2002)** examined 88 corporal punishment studies spanning six decades. The finding: spanking was consistently associated with negative behavioral outcomes. This is not a single study but a synthesis of decades of research pointing in the same direction.

## Addressing Common Defenses of Spanking

### "I Was Spanked and I Turned Out OK"

This is one of the most common justifications for spanking. The psychological dynamic behind it: it is difficult for us to believe that people who loved us would intentionally hurt us, so we feel compelled to excuse that hurt. We rationalize the experience rather than accept that our parents, who loved us, did something harmful.

The reframe: While most people who were spanked did "turn out OK," the research suggests that not being spanked would have helped them turn out even healthier. The comparison is not "spanked vs. ruined" but "spanked vs. better outcomes."

### "If We Don't Spank, Children Will Grow Up Rotten"

**International evidence contradicts this fear.** Countries that have banned corporal punishment of children - including Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, and Finland - have remarkably low rates of interpersonal violence compared to the United States.

**Professor Adrienne Haeuser's research (1981 and 1991)** on educational laws in Europe found a counterintuitive result: "Children are receiving more discipline since the law in Sweden passed. Parents think twice and tend to rely more on verbal conflict resolution to manage their children." Banning physical punishment did not lead to less discipline - it led to more thoughtful, effective discipline.

## The Alternative Framework: Discipline as Teaching

### Redefining Discipline

**The word "discipline" means "to teach."** This reframing is essential. The goal of discipline is not to punish or cause pain - it is to help children learn to manage themselves.

### What Teaching-Based Discipline Develops

Effective discipline methods develop:
- A child's **conscience** (internal sense of right and wrong)
- A child's **self-control** (ability to regulate their own behavior)

### The Outcome Difference

Children who experience teaching-based discipline:
- Are less likely to misbehave (because they have internalized self-regulation)
- Are more likely to become self-disciplined adults (the ultimate goal of parenting)

This contrasts with punishment-based approaches, which may temporarily suppress behavior through fear but do not build the internal structures children need to regulate themselves.

## Practical Context: When Positive Approaches Feel Insufficient

The parent asking this question noted that timeouts do not work with her son, and the only thing that does is "staying three steps ahead of him" - which is not always possible.

The acknowledgment here is important: some children are genuinely more challenging. The solution is not to default to spanking because it feels like the only option, but to explore the full range of positive discipline techniques. The premise that spanking is the "only thing that works" is contradicted by the research showing it actually makes behaviors worse over time.

## Key Takeaways for Conversations About Spanking

When discussing spanking with others (such as grandparents who believe spanking is necessary):

1. **Acknowledge that spanking does produce learning** - but redirect to what is actually learned
2. **Reference the research** showing spanking increases the behaviors it aims to stop
3. **Address the "I turned out fine" argument** by noting that "fine" does not mean "optimal"
4. **Point to international evidence** that banning spanking leads to less violence, not more
5. **Reframe discipline as teaching** rather than punishment
6. **Focus on the goal** of raising self-disciplined adults with functioning consciences
