## The Core Insight: Felt Love vs. Felt Anger

The love you feel for your child is not the most important factor in their emotional development. What matters is whether your child **feels** loved, unconditionally. This means the child feels loved exactly as they are, even when they're acting like a monster.

The distinction is critical: You may know you love your child during a meltdown, but ask the child and they certainly don't feel loved in that moment. Parents often think "We WANT them to know how mad we are! They can feel our love later!" But this approach backfires.

**Why unconditional felt love matters:** Your child knows you love them when they're being sweet, generous, and obedient. They're not so sure you love them when they're feeling angry, jealous, or greedy. When a child acts like a monster, they're afraid they ARE a monster. If you push them away with your anger, they become convinced that they are a monster.

## What Children Need When They're Acting Out

A child who is misbehaving needs a clear message that the parent KNOWS they are a good kid who is struggling with some big feelings at this moment but will recover and express their best self again.

**The effective intervention sequence:**
1. Calm yourself
2. Set a clear limit
3. Help the child through the big feelings that are causing them to act out

The big feelings are the root cause of the misbehavior. Addressing only the behavior without addressing the underlying feelings is incomplete.

## The Problem with Parental Anger

When parents indulge their anger, several harmful things happen simultaneously:

**What you model:** Indulging in blame and revenge, which is the exact inappropriate behavior you're trying to correct in your child.

**The message you send:** That you can't handle your child's worst self, that they're all alone with the big feelings that are swamping them.

**The long-term effects on children:**
- At best: They assume they're bad people who can never be good enough
- At worst: Many young children secretly fear parents will send them to jail or trade them in for a new kid
- Anger always erodes your relationship with your child
- Anger always increases their anxiety
- All of this makes children behave worse, not better

**Why anger blocks learning:** When a parent is angry, the child can't help but shift into "fight, flight or freeze" mode, which means the learning parts of the brain shut down. They literally cannot learn while in this state. Your child never believes your love when you're angry.

## The Victor Frankl Framework

"Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and freedom."

**The practical application:** Enlarge that space between your child's stimulus (their behavior) and your reaction, so that you have the freedom to choose a response that heals. Then you'll be able to show up as a real teacher for your child and help them process their upset constructively.

The key mechanism is noticing. Noticing is what gives you a choice next time.

## How to Handle Your Own Anger in the Moment

### Step 1: Shift Attention and Calm Yourself

When you're angry, shift your attention away from your child and concentrate on calming yourself. Instead of unloading your anger on this small person entrusted to your care and guidance, train yourself to take a deep breath and take a few minutes to calm yourself.

**The fastest way to calm down:** Give yourself some compassion. Tell yourself it's okay for this to be happening. You're a good parent, your kid is a good kid, and everyone has felt and acted this way at some point.

### Step 2: Understand Anger Ownership

You're always entitled to your anger, but it's always YOUR anger, not the other person's responsibility. This is true even when you think your child "deserves" it. In any case, that's not a judgment you can make while you're angry.

### Step 3: Reframe What "Discipline" Means

**Discipline means guidance.** Your guidance will be a lot more effective once you're calm. It's the parent's job to be the child's role model in handling emotions constructively.

**What to avoid:** Never act on anger from that "fight, flight or freeze" place where your child looks like the enemy and you have to "win" while your child has to "lose."

**Anger and punishment are never based in love.** When you're angry, only set limits to keep everyone safe. Forget about teaching your child lessons unless you're in a state of love and can teach lovingly.

**The limit-setting distinction:**
- A limit means that you intervene so that your child is not endangering anyone, including themselves (this is appropriate when angry)
- Teaching lessons requires both people to be receptive and positive (this should wait until calm)

A teachable moment is always when both people are receptive and positive.

### Step 4: Process Your Anger Correctly

**What's unhealthy:** Dumping your anger on another person. This just reinforces your rage.

**What's healthy:** A multi-step internal process:
1. Acknowledge to yourself how you feel: angry
2. Be brave enough to pause and notice what's under your anger: hurt, fear, sadness, disappointment
3. Allow yourself to feel those sensations in your body without acting on them
4. The feelings begin to melt away
5. Once you've calmed down, you'll be better able to take care of your own hurt places AND intervene so your child learns how to manage their behavior better

**The insight about anger:** Anger typically masks other emotions like hurt, fear, sadness, or disappointment. Addressing these underlying emotions is more productive than expressing the anger itself.

### Step 5: Wait for Teachable Moments

Rage is not the lesson you want to teach. If you make your teachable moments into learnable moments by waiting until your child is receptive, your teaching will stick.

**What the child gains from this approach:**
- The lesson about behavior
- Lessons about self-regulation (even more valuable)
- The unshakable conviction that they are wholly and unconditionally loved exactly as they are, including all those messy, passionate emotions that make us human

## The Neuroplasticity Principle

This is not easy. It's one of the hardest things for anyone to do. But every time you manage your anger instead of dumping it onto your child, it gets easier. You're actually re-wiring your brain.

The more you practice finding that moment of freedom between the stimulus (your child's behavior) and your own response, the more natural it becomes.

## The "Win-Win" Framing

Loving unconditionally is "Win-Win" parenting. Not acting on your anger creates more space for love. And where there is more love, there is always more room for miracles.

**Love looks for solutions, not blame.** This orientation fundamentally changes how you approach discipline situations.

## Healing Your Ability to Love Unconditionally

Healing your ability to love unconditionally means committing to parenting from love, not anger, no matter what. This doesn't mean you won't get angry at your child. You will still get angry, and you won't feel very loving at those moments.

**The reframe:** Loving unconditionally when you're furious isn't easy. In fact, it's such heavy lifting of the heart that it builds real love muscle. But nothing changes your child's behavior quite as quickly.

The difficulty is the feature, not the bug. The challenge of managing anger in the heat of the moment is what builds the capacity for unconditional love over time.

## Common Trigger Scenarios

The article acknowledges specific situations that make it hard to feel love for children:
- Child slams homework on the floor and storms off
- Child screams "I hate you!" and slams the door
- Child throws a toy at your head
- Child throws a fit in a restaurant
- Child hits a sibling

These situations make parents feel attacked, publicly shamed, or worried about keeping one of their children safe. The impulse to "lose it" is understandable but counterproductive.
