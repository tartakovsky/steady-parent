# The Transformative Power of Love in Parenting

## The Secret Purpose of Parenting

Parenting has two purposes - an obvious one and a hidden one. The obvious purpose is to raise children. The **secret purpose** is to transform the parents themselves. Loving a child helps parents heal themselves, which enables them to live more fully.

Parents commonly forget this secret purpose and reduce parenting to "teaching" children. In practice, this teaching often degrades further into **controlling** - an endless series of struggles over everyday tasks: sleep, potty training, teeth brushing, eating dinner, sibling conflicts, homework, cleaning rooms. These control struggles drain all the joy from parenting.

## The Illusion of Control

A fundamental truth: parents don't actually have control over their children. Children are human beings who make their own choices. Parents' ideas of what a child "should" do frequently won't align with the child's own ideas.

This lack of control isn't a problem to solve - it's a reality to accept. The struggles emerge from fighting against this reality rather than working with it.

## Five Strategies to Avoid Struggles

Rather than engaging in control battles, parents can prevent many struggles by:

1. **Staying connected** - maintaining the relationship bond
2. **Seeing things from the child's perspective and acknowledging their feelings** - empathy precedes cooperation
3. **Staying calm** - parental regulation enables child regulation
4. **Looking for win/win solutions** - moving beyond zero-sum thinking
5. **Helping kids with the upset feelings that drive them to act out** - addressing root causes rather than surface behaviors
6. **Delighting in each child** - genuine enjoyment of who they are

## When Things Have Already Gone Wrong

The strategies above work best preventatively. But what about when you're already trapped in a negative cycle? When there's resentment, hurt feelings, and anger on both sides? When you find yourself blowing up at your child repeatedly?

**The way out is love** - but this requires precise understanding of what "love" means in this context.

### What Love Is NOT in This Context

- Not a lofty, grand idea
- Not the feeling of love (which becomes inaccessible when you're in fight/flight/freeze and your child appears to be the enemy)

### What Love IS in This Context

**Love as an action.** Specifically: the nitty-gritty, courageous thing you do in the moment when your child appears possessed and you've reached the end of your rope, ready to give up. It's the choice that faces you in terrible moments when you're hot with rage and cold with fright inside.

The choice is always between **love and fear**.

## The Practical Process: How to Choose Love in Crisis Moments

### Step 1: Forget Your Programming
Tell yourself a mantra: **"Whatever the question, love is the answer."** (This phrase is attributed to The Dalai Lama.) Abandon temporarily everything you've been taught about what you're "supposed to do" as a parent.

### Step 2: Shift Your Physiology
Take a deep breath and blow it out slowly. This shifts you back into **belly breathing**, which calms the nervous system. The physiological shift must come first because you cannot think your way out of a dysregulated state.

### Step 3: Reframe the Situation
Remind yourself: **your child's behavior is not a reflection on you.** Only your reaction to their behavior reflects on you.

Continue breathing. Let go of fearful thoughts about how your child is "turning out." These future-oriented fears are unhelpful in the present moment. Every moment offers a new choice of how to react.

### Step 4: See the Child Behind the Behavior
Look at this beautiful child you love, who is acting so upsettingly right now. Consider: **how terrible must she feel inside to be acting like this?**

The child's upset is a **physiological state**. Someone this out of control cannot listen to reason and cannot learn at this moment. What they need is to feel safe enough to move from fight-or-flight back into equilibrium. Only the parent can help the child re-regulate.

### Step 5: Pour Love Into the Child
Forget about the behavior for now - you can address it later when both parties can reason. Right now, go beyond the behavior to heal its cause. Just pour your love into your child.

- Stay present
- Keep breathing
- Accept who they're being at this moment - all the tears, rage, and rebellion
- Soften yourself, and the child will soften too

## Why This Approach Works: The Underlying Mechanism

The child's difficult behavior signals internal distress. Addressing the behavior without addressing the underlying emotional state is futile because:
- A dysregulated child cannot process logic or lessons
- Punishment or correction in this state increases fear, deepening dysregulation
- Only feeling safe allows the child to return to equilibrium

When the parent shifts from fear to love, they become a source of safety rather than threat. This allows the child's nervous system to co-regulate with the parent's calm state.

## Heather T. Forbes Framework

**"Behind the anger, behind the disrespect, and behind the manipulation is a scared child in desperate need of connection, love, and acceptance."**

This reframe is crucial: what appears as aggression, defiance, or manipulation is actually fear-driven behavior from a child who desperately needs connection.

**"If you show up for your child in a different state, he can only be different."**

The parent's state determines what's possible. A parent in fear/anger locks the child into reciprocal fear/anger. A parent in love opens space for the child to shift.

**"When you are in a loving state, you automatically do the right thing."**

This eliminates the need to figure out the "correct" technique. The loving state itself guides appropriate action.

**"Love never fails."**

## The Difficulty Acknowledged

This approach is explicitly acknowledged as **one of the hardest things you'll ever do**. Shifting from fear into love requires summoning all available courage and strength. The simplicity of the concept doesn't make the execution easy.

However: each time you make this shift, it gets easier. You're **laying down neural pathways and rewiring your brain**. The practice builds capacity.

## Core Principles Summarized

- **No child is beyond your love** - the approach applies universally
- **No love you give is ever wasted** - even when immediate results aren't visible
- **Love never fails** - presented as an absolute principle
- **Whatever the question, love is the answer** - a decision heuristic for difficult moments

## The Promise

Consistently choosing love over fear in difficult moments leads to:
- Fewer tough moments overall (the pattern breaks)
- More "melt-your-heart" moments with your child
- Genuine enjoyment of your unique child
- Loving being your child's parent
- Rediscovery of joy in parenting

The transformation isn't just in the child's behavior - it's in the parent's experience of parenting itself.
