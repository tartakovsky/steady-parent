## Core Problem: The Emotional Backpack

Children carry an **"emotional backpack"** full of old stuffed feelings. These unprocessed emotions don't disappear - they continuously bubble up in an attempt to heal. However, children (like most humans) respond to the discomfort of these rising feelings by **lashing out with anger**. The anger serves as a defense against the underlying fear or hurt from past experiences.

This creates a visible pattern: when emotions bubble up seeking release and healing, the child lashes out - trying to hit a sibling, yelling at a pet, or being contrary with parents. The aggressive behavior is not the core problem; it's a symptom of the unprocessed emotions beneath.

## The Two-Part Framework for Creating Safety

For a child to feel safe enough to work through upsetting emotions, parents must create safety in two dimensions:

**Part 1: Continuous Safety (24/7)**
- Responding to needs consistently
- Empathizing with the child's experience
- Being playful in daily interactions

**Part 2: Elevated Understanding During Emotional Moments**
When a child becomes emotional or angry, the parent must ramp up their compassionate response. If the parent can respond with total compassion during these moments, and if the child feels safe enough, the feelings behind the anger will eventually burst out. The typical progression is: the child starts off angry but ends up sobbing in the parent's arms. After this release, parents observe the child becoming more connected, happy, and cooperative.

## The 12-Step Process for Helping Children Release Stuffed Emotions

### Step 1: Work on Yourself First

The parent's own emotional state is always the first priority. Being compassionate with a child who is hitting a baby or being mean to a pet is genuinely difficult. Parents need opportunities to "off-load" their own feelings about:
- Their child's difficult behavior
- Their own reactions to that behavior
- Past parenting choices and worries about their effects

**Practical approaches:**
- Write in a journal
- Talk to a friend or counselor who won't try to change you
- Talk to yourself and breathe through anxiety or fear as it arises

All parents carry anxieties about their children. The more parents can acknowledge these feelings and breathe through them without acting on them, the less their fears and worries will drive their responses to their child.

### Step 2: Get in Touch with Compassion for Your Child

**Shift to the child's perspective.** For a young child, the parent is the center of the universe. When a new sibling arrives, the child may be:
- Terrified that the parent loves the baby more
- Feeling like a terrible person for having negative feelings
- Ashamed of lashing out
- Unable to control themselves despite wanting to

Though the child may seem huge compared to a baby, they are still a very small person, very new to the world. What they want more than anything is to feel fully loved and accepted - to know they are good enough exactly as they are.

### Step 3: Strengthen the Bond Through Special Time

For a child to feel safe enough to show vulnerable feelings, the parent-child bond must be strong. **Special time** should be:
- At minimum 10 minutes daily
- 20 minutes is even better
- Conducted according to specific practices that transform the relationship

Beyond scheduled special time, parents should look for ways to connect throughout the day. Even when setting limits, the parent should try to stay connected while doing so.

### Step 4: Use Laughter as Emotional Release

**Laughter releases the same stress hormones as tears.** This is a crucial insight because children who won't cry may still release through giggling.

The child's acting out often stems from worry that they aren't loved as much as a sibling, or that they aren't a good enough person. They have tears and fears they need to release. If the child won't engage in a pillow fight, find other ways to make them laugh.

The more the parent laughs with the child:
- The more connected the child feels
- The safer they feel
- The more likely they become to show their feelings

### Step 5: Be Explicit About Allowing Feelings

**Acknowledge emotions and name them**, treating emotional states as matter-of-factly as the weather: "You are mad." This simple acknowledgment accomplishes several things at once.

**When setting limits, always acknowledge the emotion first:** "You are mad, but no hitting." This structure:
- Validates the feeling
- Builds emotional literacy
- Prevents feelings from being stuffed

**Use books to normalize emotions:**
- Books about feelings in general develop emotional intelligence
- Books specifically about jealousy of new siblings help children stop feeling guilty
- When children feel less guilty, they don't work as hard to repress their feelings

**Comment on feelings in the environment:** "That boy is crying... it looks like maybe he is sad and mad at his mom... you can love someone and be mad at them at the same time."

This last example teaches a crucial lesson: conflicting emotions can coexist. Loving someone and being angry at them can happen simultaneously.

### Step 6: Sidestep Power Struggles

Power struggles require two participants. If the parent sidesteps, there won't be a power struggle. This requires an attitude shift.

**For each potential conflict, ask:** Does it really matter? If it does, find a way to give the child some power in the situation.

**Six strategies for sidestepping (using the example of a child refusing to put on shoes):**

1. **Invitation to play:** "No shoes? How will you skip? I was hoping to skip with you to the car!"

2. **Ask for help solving the problem:** "Sweetie, we have a problem. We have to leave right now; it's cold and wet outside; and you don't have your shoes on yet. What should we do?" Most children can't resist being the problem-solver.

3. **Give something to move toward:** "In the car, do you want to play that game where we make the lights turn green by counting? Ok, quick, let's get your shoes on so we can go!"

4. **Offer a choice:** "Sweetie, you need shoes, it's wet outside. Do you want to wear your sneakers or your boots? Ok, boots, let's get them on."

5. **Connection through playfulness:** "I think those toes need kissing before they can go into those shoes, that's the problem... I'm kissing all those toes... 1,2,3,4,5... what delicious toes! Oh, they're talking to me... they're saying 'Put me in my shoe!' Ok, in they go... Now the other foot!"

6. **Invite autonomy:** "You can't put your shoes on yourself, can you? NO? Really? I don't believe it! WOW! You can! Look at you putting on your own shoes!"

**Critical prerequisite:** The parent must be in a good mood to execute any of these strategies. Staying calm and connected enables shifting the child into a more cooperative state.

### Step 7: Fill the Love Cup

**Reframe acting out as a cry for love:** "Are you out of hugs again? Let's do something about that!"

**The long hug technique:**
1. Grab the child and give them a LONG hug - as long as possible
2. Don't loosen your grip until they begin to squirm
3. When they squirm, don't let go immediately
4. Hug harder and say "I LOVE hugging you! I never want to let go. Promise I can hug you again soon?"
5. Then release and connect with a big, warm smile
6. Say "Thank you! I needed that!"

### Step 8: Intervene Playfully When Misbehavior Occurs

When the child tries to hit a sibling or yells at a pet, intervene with warmth rather than harshness.

**The playful intervention sequence:**

1. **Grab the child warmly and name what's happening:** "What's that? Yelling at the dog? Yes, yes, we can be mad, but No, we can't scare the dog!"

2. **Move to physical play:** Take them to the couch to roughhouse (kissing all over, tossing around), or run around the room with them while chanting: "We're mad, we're mad, but we can't scare the dog!"

3. **Observe the result after putting them down:**

**Outcome A - They bask in warm attention:** This means reconnection was what they needed. The warm attention filled them up, and they feel truly loved. Success.

**Outcome B - They head back toward the dog/baby:** This is actually good. The child's feelings are too big to ignore. The playfulness served as "permission" or an invitation to acknowledge feelings. When they head back toward the target, grab them up and repeat the playful running and chanting.

4. **After several rounds, observe again:**

**Outcome A - Child relaxes and snuggles:** They giggled a lot and now feel deeply connected.

**Outcome B - Child becomes frenzied:** Feelings are reaching a fevered pitch. Or the parent has simply had enough. This signals it's time to transition.

5. **Transition to calm compassion:** Take a deep breath. Change from playful to calmly compassionate. Stop and place the child next to you on the couch or rug (away from the baby). Look them in the eye and say compassionately and seriously: "Ok, Sweetie, no more playing... I won't let you scare the dog... (hurt the baby.)"

6. **Almost certainly, the child will begin crying.** The sense of safety built through play allows the tears to emerge.

**How to hold during crying:**
- Hold warmly, as in a hug
- Hold if necessary to keep them from hurting you, the dog, or the baby
- Don't hold if you don't need to for safety
- Get in touch with your compassion for this small person
- Reassure them: "Sweetie, you are so upset... you are really hurting... I won't let you hurt the dog..."

### Step 9: Experiment with Language

Children vary in what helps them cry:

**Some children need explicit permission:** "Everybody needs to cry sometimes... You can cry as much as you want... I am right here."

**Many children become self-conscious when crying is mentioned.** For these children, simply create safety and let them feel whatever emotions arise: "I am right here... I will keep you safe."

**The key principle:** You don't have to say much. Just make it safe for the child to feel.

### Step 10: Handle Running Away

When a child runs to another room during an emotional moment, they're leaving because the parent's warm, loving presence is allowing tears to bubble up. Naturally, the child doesn't want to feel those feelings, so they flee.

**The message to convey:** The parent will always be there, even if the child tries to push them away with anger.

**How to handle:**
- Let the child regulate the distance by saying: "I hear you want me to leave... I will step back a little, to here."
- Reassure them you're there when they're ready for a hug
- Even if they shout to leave them alone, they don't mean it
- They desperately want to reconnect

### Step 11: Welcome Fear

Children may have fear to express from:
- Past spankings or punishments
- The many things small children are afraid of daily (fear is frequent in childhood)

**Fear must be felt before it will heal.**

**Physical signs of releasing fear:**
- Writhing
- Sweating
- Red face
- Seeming to struggle more than cry
- Wanting to push against the parent

**How to respond:**
- Provide resistance when they push against you
- If they lash out, protect yourself from getting hurt
- Let them push against your hands
- Hold a couch pillow in front of you for them to push against
- Use a warm, compassionate, soothing voice
- Don't analyze or say much
- Reassure them that you are there and they are safe

**The typical resolution:** After releasing fear, children collapse in the parent's arms and want to reconnect.

### Step 12: Keep the Tears Coming

The goal is helping the child surface their most vulnerable hurts, which are accompanied by tears. To facilitate this:

**Gently remind them of the trigger:** "I'm sorry the baby upset you, Sweetie."

When you remind them, you'll likely notice increased sobbing. This is good - it's the way into the snarl of emotions. You're helping them:
- Loosen up the tangled emotions
- Feel them fully
- Show you the feelings
- Let them go

## The Fundamental Reassurance

Parents don't have to do anything to **make** a child feel their emotions. The only requirement is to embrace the child with warm compassion and adore them - messy, contrary feelings and all. With that unconditional love, the child will open up to healing and will blossom.

## Key Principles Summarized

**On emotions surfacing:** Emotions always bubble up in an attempt to heal. The parent's job is to create conditions where this natural healing process can complete rather than being defended against.

**On anger:** Anger defends against fear and hurt. What looks like aggression is usually a child's attempt to keep painful feelings at bay.

**On the parent's state:** The parent's emotional regulation and compassion are prerequisites for everything else. You can't do playful interventions from a frustrated state.

**On safety:** Safety comes in two forms - ongoing daily safety through responsiveness and playfulness, plus heightened compassionate response during emotional moments.

**On laughter:** Laughter and tears release the same stress hormones. A child who won't cry may still heal through giggling.

**On power struggles:** They require two participants. Sidestep rather than engage, and find ways to give the child power within necessary limits.

**On running away:** The child flees because the parent's loving presence is bringing up feelings. Stay nearby, let them regulate distance, but don't abandon.

**On physical release of fear:** Fear often comes out through physical struggle rather than tears. Provide resistance and containment while maintaining warmth.
