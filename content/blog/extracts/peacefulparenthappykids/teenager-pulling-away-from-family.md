## The Normal Nature of Teen Distancing

**Pulling away is developmentally normal**, even in intact biological families. It is part of how teens establish their independence. They are practicing for the day when they will need to stand on their own two feet as independent people. This means distancing themselves from their families is a natural part of this process.

However, teens still need to know their parents are there for them. Most fifteen year olds say they wish they could talk with their parents but they just don't know how to be closer. This creates an important opening for parents who understand how to bridge that gap.

## Strategy 1: Work to Stay Close Through Deliberate Connection

The foundation is the individual relationship between parent and teen. Think back to when the child was little at the playground, yelling "Look at me, Mommy!" while hanging on the monkey bars. **The need to feel seen by a parent persists** into adolescence. Teens still need attention to feel good about themselves and their new achievements, but it has to be the kind of attention that supports rather than limits them.

The teen still needs the parent but cannot acknowledge it openly. The parent's job is to find every opportunity to warmly connect.

### Effective Connection Opportunities

**Walking together** (with the dog or just a daily walk) creates natural connection time.

**Transitions throughout the day** matter: hug hello and goodbye when leaving for school or work.

**Car rides** are particularly effective because eye contact is limited and the ride is guaranteed to end, which makes people feel safer talking.

**Bedtime moments**: If the teen will allow it, lying down next to them for a few minutes as they're going to bed to discuss their day creates quiet connection time. Parents often report that car rides and bedtime are the two times when they have their best discussions with their teens.

**Regular one-on-one time** at least once a week, going out together for brunch, a manicure, or just running errands, maximizes these connection opportunities.

### Conversation Approach

When talking with the teen, **resist the urge to lecture**. Instead: ask questions and listen. Give the daughter space to be a separate person with her own developing identity. If the parent can do that, the teen won't need to push the parent away in order to become herself.

## Strategy 2: Don't Take It Personally

Try not to feel hurt by the teen's behavior. Most of it is not about the parent at all but about the teen's urgent need to shape an identity as a separate, independent person.

When feeling hurt, just breathe and stay calm. **The minute the parent gets triggered, they're pushing the teen away.**

A helpful reframe: This is the teen version of the toddler's alternating "do it myself" with meltdowns. Both represent the process of becoming comfortable with independence.

The parent's job is to be the teen's safe foundation, so she can grow her wings and experiment with leaving the nest in safe ways, knowing that the parent is waiting when she needs to refuel.

### Addressing Mean Behavior

If the teen is actually mean (beyond the usual annoyance of pushing away), making frequent cutting remarks, this is a sign of a relationship that needs strengthening. The parent will get no respect if the teen doesn't feel connected to them.

## Strategy 3: Seek First to Understand

When the teen acts out or is disrespectful, acknowledge that she is upset and take responsibility for any way in which the parent is contributing to the unhappiness. The parent's job is always to de-escalate the drama.

**Example response to mean behavior**: "Ouch! Are you trying to hurt my feelings? You must be mad at me to use that tone/words like that. Tell me what's upsetting you, Sweetheart. We can work this out."

Teenage girls are famous for feeling like their moms "just don't understand." Parents need to cultivate a whole new level of empathy. As the parent listens, they should remind themselves that the upset of the moment may not seem like a big deal to the adult, but to the teen it feels like the end of the world.

### Using Ruptures as Opportunities

Teenage girls can be volatile. If the parent can:
- Empathize with them
- Look for the upset under the disrespect
- Remind them of who they really are ("You don't usually act unkindly")

...this creates an opening. **The inevitable ruptures of daily life become opportunities** to model:
- How to process emotions
- How to repair an emotional rift
- How to problem solve
- That the teen can trust the parent

Most importantly, parents end these interactions with a stronger relationship.

## Strategy 6: Require Family Dinners at Least Four Days a Week

**Research shows** (Luthar and Latendresse, 2005) that even when relationships between parents and teens are strained, family dinners are important for teens. The benefits include:
- Better performance in school
- Greater happiness
- Less proneness to depression and anxiety

## Strategy 7: Deepen Discussions with Questions About Family Dynamics

These conversations are particularly relevant for blended families but the principle applies broadly. Ask open-ended questions that invite the teen to reflect on family relationships:

**Questions about family comparison and closeness:**
- How do you think your friends' families compare to ours? Are they about as close? Closer? More distant? Why do you think that?
- Do you think your friends talk to their parents?
- What do you think makes a family close?

**Questions about communication:**
- Do you feel like you could talk with me about anything at all?

**Questions about parenting style:**
- How do your stepdad and I compare to your friends' parents? Are we about as strict? More? Less?

**Questions about the absent biological parent (if applicable):**
- Do you ever miss your dad?
- Do you think things would be different if your dad was still with us and I had never met your stepdad? How?

**Questions about stepparent relationship:**
- Even though your stepdad is not your biological dad, you know he adores you. Do you feel close to him?

**Questions about sibling relationships:**
- You know, to your little sister you are completely her sister, not her stepsister. Do you feel that way, or is it different for you?
- Do you feel close to her?
- When you both grow up, do you think you will stay connected?

### How to Conduct These Conversations

The teen may have a lot of feelings about her biological father and about her sister's role in the family. The parent should:
- Just listen and empathize without getting defensive
- Let the teen go slowly in this exploration
- Defuse the conversation and just accept whatever feelings she has
- Keep a gentle, accepting tone

If the parent can do this, the teen will probably keep talking. **This is not one big conversation but many small ones over time.** It will probably keep unfolding over months. If the daughter gets the chance to process her feelings about all this, she will probably be able to relax more into the family.

## Strategy 8: Ask the Teen What Activities Would Make It Feel Like a Family

**Involve the teen in defining what family means to her.** Ask directly what kinds of activities you could all do together that would make it feel like a family to her.

When there's a big age difference between children, options include:
- Games of chance (rather than skill, to level the playing field)
- Good conversations at dinner
- Going to a museum
- Taking walks together

## Strategy 9: Use Holidays to Build Family Connection Rituals

Developing rituals that connect the family during various holidays helps the teen start to feel more like part of the family.

### Specific Holiday Ideas

**Thanksgiving:**
- Bake pies with both daughters

**December holidays:**
- Pull out decorations and get her to help, but don't worry what the house looks like. Focus on connecting.
- Go gift shopping with her for other family members. Make it about her: take her to lunch, encourage her to try on clothes and buy her something she covets, or just make sure the conversation in the car is really special.
- Invite a few of her friends over for a holiday cookie-baking party. Be the fly on the wall, assisting as necessary and just enjoying as the young people talk. If she isn't interested, ask if she will help host a small cookie-baking party for the younger sibling.
- Have a family evening making holiday cards, writing them, making gift-wrap, or wrapping gifts.
- Ask if she will volunteer with you to pack or deliver meals to housebound senior citizens.

**Year-round continuation:**
- **New Year's ritual**: Each person in the family says what they are leaving behind and what they're looking forward to
- Making each other homemade Valentines cards
- Continue building rituals throughout the year

## Strategy 10: Include the Stepparent in Special Time

Take the teen to dinner with her stepparent included. This creates dedicated time for that relationship to develop.

## The Most Important Factor: Family Atmosphere

Above all specific strategies, **the mood in the family matters most**. If the parents can focus on creating a warm, playful, welcoming atmosphere, they may find that the daughter is hanging out with them more.

The atmosphere is the foundation that makes all other strategies effective.
