## The Core Question: Is Clingy Behavior a Problem?

When children become clingy, demanding, or possessive of a parent's time and attention, parents often wonder: Is this a legitimate need or "undue attention-seeking"? Is the child too dependent or attached?

**The fundamental premise: There is no such thing as "undue" attention. If a child is asking for attention, they need attention.**

This does not mean the child runs the parent's life or gets everything they demand. Parents are people too and need to care for themselves and their relationships. But it does mean parents can start from the premise that the child is expressing something valid that deserves respect, even when requests cannot always be fulfilled.

## Common Triggers for Clingy Behavior

### Family Structure Changes

Children often become more clingy following divorce, remarriage, or the introduction of a stepparent. **Very few children of any age fail to perceive stepparents as competitors for their parent's love.** The child's internal logic may run: "Mommy stopped loving Daddy. Now there's this new guy. Will Mommy stop loving me now?"

The usual reaction to this perceived competition is to cling, demand, and seek reassurance of the parent's continued love.

### Developmental Transitions

Many six-year-olds go through a clingy phase regardless of family circumstances. They are making significant developmental leaps - learning to read, starting formal school, learning physical skills like riding bikes and tying shoes. **Often children need reassurance that the parent is still there for them precisely when they appear most confident in the world.**

Even well-adjusted children have daily experiences that are scary to them but invisible to adults:
- Going on playdates without a parent
- Experiencing teacher disapproval
- Not being able to find the bathroom in a new environment
- Being excluded by peers at school

## Why "Too Dependent" Is Not a Useful Framework

**All children move from dependence to independence on their own schedule.** Evaluating whether a child is "too dependent" is not constructive because:

1. The more a parent meets the child's need for connection, the more secure the child becomes
2. Security is the foundation for healthy experimentation with independence
3. By adolescence, parents typically wish their children wanted to spend time with them

Meeting connection needs now builds the foundation for later independence.

## Two Approaches When Clingy Behavior Becomes Demanding

If the child's preference for closeness is expressed with affection and enthusiasm, simply meeting the need through connection is sufficient. However, if the behavior becomes threatening, difficult, or demanding, this signals unhappiness that needs a different response. The child still needs attention, but **they need a chance to release unhappy feelings** rather than just more of the same attention they are demanding.

### Approach A: Love Them Through Their Feelings

**Step 1: Set a reasonable, loving limit**

Choose something you feel clear about (not guilty about) so you can maintain the boundary. For example: going out to dinner while the child stays with a known, trusted caregiver.

**Step 2: Empathize with the child's unhappiness about the limit**

Whether or not you agree with their feelings is irrelevant - they are allowed to have them. Simple acknowledgment: "You really wish I wouldn't go."

**Step 3: Allow crying and strong reactions**

If the child has been expressing unhappiness through demanding behavior, they will likely "over-react" to the limit. This is not truly an overreaction - **they are tapping into the reservoir of fear and sadness that has been driving their behavior.**

**Step 4: Stay present with tenderness**

Parental tenderness allows the child to feel safe expressing difficult feelings. Stay with them, let them vent, and do not take their expressions personally.

### Approach B: Help Them Play the Feelings Out

Children can effectively work through emotions through play. This is an alternative to processing through crying and can be more accessible for some children.

## Five Specific Games for Clingy Children

### Game 1: The Long Hug (When Demanding Attention Annoyingly)

When the child is annoying you by being demanding: "Are you out of hugs again? Let's do something about that!"

Grab the child and give them a LONG hug - as long as possible. Do not loosen your grip until they begin to squirm, then do not let go immediately. Hug harder and say: "I LOVE hugging you! I never want to let go. Promise I can hug you again soon?"

Then let go, connect with a warm smile: "Thank you! I needed that!"

### Game 2: The Squishing Game (When Climbing on You)

When the child wants to climb on top of you, make it a game with exaggerated helplessness:

"No, no, don't climb on top of me... you're too big... you might squish me... Oh, no, now you're on top of me... I can't move... I can't get up... I have to stay right here with you no matter what... I am all yours... Nobody else can even see me... You're in charge of me..."

**This gives the child the experience of having complete control over the parent's attention.**

### Game 3: The Chase Game (When Child Constantly Pursues You)

Let the child experience you pursuing them, so they gain confidence that they can stop constantly pursuing and you will stay close.

Play the bumbler as you chase, hug, kiss, let them get away and repeat: "I need my [child's name] fix... You can't get away... I have to hug you and cover you with kisses... oh, no, you got away... I'm coming after you... I just have to kiss you more and hug you more... You're too fast for me... But I'll never give up... I love you too much... I got you... Now I'll kiss your toes... Oh, no, you're too strong for me... But I will always want more hugs..."

**This reverses the dynamic so the child feels pursued rather than always being the pursuer.**

### Game 4: The Competing-for-Mom Game (For Stepparent/New Partner Situations)

This game requires the partner's participation. The parent sits on the couch. The partner gets between the child and the parent, boasting: "You can't get to Mommy! Mommy is all mine! Only I get to be with Mommy! I will keep you from getting to Mommy!"

As the child tries to get past, the partner should grab at them but bumble and be unsuccessful. The parent cheers the child on, expressing clear preference and confidence that the child will reach them. When the child reaches the parent, celebrate with laughter and hugs.

**Critical implementation notes:**
- The partner must not be scary to the child
- Provide just enough obstacle that the child actually pushes past while the partner bumbles ineffectually
- The partner should boast and challenge but always lose
- Exaggerate the boasting

**If the child giggles extensively, this indicates they are releasing fears and anxieties about wanting the parent to themselves.**

### Game 5: The Escape Game

This game allows children to giggle out their feelings rather than cry them out. (See referenced article for full description.)

## Implementation Notes

- Do only one game per session
- Expect the child to beg to repeat the game many times, and for many days
- After a play session, the child is likely to relax more in their connection
- These games function as emotional release valves

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Attention-seeking is need-expressing** - If a child asks for attention, they need it
2. **Security enables independence** - Meeting connection needs now builds the foundation for later autonomy
3. **Demanding behavior signals emotional overload** - The child needs to release difficult feelings, not just get more attention
4. **Play processes emotions** - Games that address the child's specific fears (of losing the parent, of being replaced) allow feelings to be released through laughter
5. **Clingy phases are normal** - Many children, especially around age 6, go through periods of increased need for parental closeness due to developmental demands
