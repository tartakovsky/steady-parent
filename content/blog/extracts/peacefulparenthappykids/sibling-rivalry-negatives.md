# Understanding Sibling Rivalry: Why It's Never Actually Good for Children

## The Core Position: Sibling Rivalry Is Never Beneficial

The common idea that "a little sibling rivalry is healthy" is rejected entirely. While some online sources suggest rivalry can be good for children, this position conflates two different things: the valuable lessons that come from having siblings, and the jealousy/rivalry itself.

## Distinguishing Between Sibling Benefits and Sibling Rivalry

**What siblings can teach children:**
- Learning to get along with others
- Expressing your needs without attacking the other person
- Delaying gratification
- Waiting your turn

**The crucial distinction:** These lessons do not come from rivalry. They come from children loving the other child enough to be willing to regulate themselves in the context of the relationship. The motivation is love and connection, not competition.

**Important research note:** Children don't actually need siblings to learn these lessons. Research shows children will also learn these same skills through friendships with peers. The sibling relationship is not the only path to these social-emotional competencies.

## What Sibling Rivalry Actually Is

**Sibling rivalry** is defined as the feeling of jealousy that all siblings occasionally feel toward each other. This feeling stems from competition for scarce resources that all children need to thrive, specifically: the parent's time and loving attention.

The feeling of jealousy is completely within the range of normal. However, it is also a **red flag** that the child is in need of some loving connection with the parent.

## The Security-Rivalry Connection

When a child feels truly adored by his parent and trusts his parent to meet his needs, he believes that his parent could never love anyone else more. This child doesn't have much occasion to feel sibling rivalry.

When sibling rivalry does appear occasionally in a secure child, attentive parents will notice and increase their connection with the child, allowing him to relax into their love. The feeling passes because the underlying need gets met.

## When Sibling Rivalry Becomes Harmful

**Conditions that increase rivalry and aggression:**
- Children not having closeness with their parents
- Children feeling that another child is the favorite

**Consequences of unaddressed rivalry:**
- Psychological harm in each child
- Life-long rift between the children
- The more bad feelings result in aggressiveness, the more harm occurs
- If one sibling bullies the other, this can cause major long-term harm

## The Parent's Response: Treat Rivalry as a Red Flag

When parents notice sibling rivalry, they should take it seriously as a signal that they need to strengthen the relationship they have with each child.

**Specific tools for strengthening parent-child connection:**
- Spending one-on-one time daily with each child
- Creating a family culture of support rather than competition

## The Core Insight: Delight Prevents Jealousy

The most important factor: When kids feel we delight in them, they don't need to be jealous of their siblings.

This reframes the problem entirely. Sibling rivalry is not something to manage between the children. It is a symptom of unmet needs in the parent-child relationship. The solution lies in the parent's relationship with each individual child, not in mediating between siblings.
