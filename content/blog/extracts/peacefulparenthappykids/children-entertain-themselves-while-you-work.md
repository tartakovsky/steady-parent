# Can Young Children Entertain Themselves While You Work?

## Core Insight: This Is Not a Power Struggle

When a toddler screams for hours while confined to a play area so a parent can work, this is not a battle of wills where the child is "testing limits." It is a **failure to communicate** - the child has fundamental developmental needs that are not being met, and screaming is the only way they can express this.

The parent perspective: "My child should play quietly for two hours with the toys I've provided. He can even see me. If I give in to crying, I'll teach him that crying gets him what he wants."

The child's perspective: Their most fundamental emotional requirement is being ignored - the need to know they can cause their mother to love them and respond to their needs.

Dr. Markham's assessment: What the parent is asking is **developmentally impossible** for a 14-month-old. The child is not only suffering but learning harmful lessons about their worth and their ability to affect the world.

## Developmental Needs at 14 Months

### Why This Worked When the Child Was Younger

As a baby, a child might tolerate being in a bouncer or baby seat near a working parent because sitting gave them plenty of stimulation and connection. But at 14 months, everything has changed developmentally.

### What a 14-Month-Old Actually Needs

**Physical and intellectual stimulation through exploration:**
- Toddlers need to roam and explore freely
- They need to pull books off shelves and pans from cupboards
- They need fairly constant climbing and running
- They learn through engagement and doing - not through sitting with provided toys

**Emotional sense of competence and power:**
- Children this age need to feel their competence and power in the world
- When parents demonstrate they care about the child's needs and will meet them without the child having to fight, cry, and whine, the child tantrums less and cooperates more
- The inverse is also true: when a child feels powerless to get their needs met, they protest more intensely

### The "North Star" Concept

Young children need the constant presence of a **North Star** around which to orient themselves - and that North Star is the parent.

What this looks like in practice:
- At the playground, a toddler needs to know which bench their parent is sitting on so they can toddle over for frequent **emotional refueling**
- If the parent leaves, the child will cry, then gradually orient themselves around a babysitter, and breathe a sigh of relief when the parent reappears
- When the child looks up from playing and cannot see the parent, or tries to come to the parent and finds a gate blocking them, they panic

This is not manipulation or a power play - it is a survival mechanism. Throughout human history, 14-month-olds who could not make their caregivers respond to them mostly did not survive.

## The Damaging Messages of the "Ignore the Crying" Approach

When a parent gets a child settled with toys and then ignores their distress, the child learns:

1. **No matter how much I panic and try to show you I need you, I am so unlovable that you won't respond**
2. **People who love you can suddenly withdraw their love and act like they don't know you**
3. **I am powerless to affect the world in the way that matters most - by getting my parent to respond to me**
4. **I am invisible**

The child internalizes that they don't matter as much as whatever the parent is doing behind that gate. The child cannot possibly understand that this work puts food on the table. To them, this feels like it could be a matter of life or death.

## Why the "Don't Give In" Advice Is Partially Right but Misapplied

There is truth to the concern about "giving in" - if a child cries for an hour and then the parent picks them up and consoles them, this teaches the child to just keep protesting and eventually the parent will give in.

**But this doesn't mean the solution is to ignore the crying.** The solution is to not create the impossible situation in the first place.

## Practical Solutions

### Solutions That Won't Work

**TV is not the answer:**
Research shows negative effects on brain development, vocabulary, sleep patterns, and emotional development. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children under age two should not watch any TV at all.

**Working at home while the child plays in their usual space:**
This is slightly better than the "prison" setup because the child has freedom to move. However, it is not sustainable because as soon as parents get on the phone or absorbed in the computer, children sense the loss of attention and start to fret.

Why is work different from household tasks? When doing dishes, parents remain emotionally available and children sense this. When absorbed in focused work, parents are emotionally unavailable and children sense this too.

### The Recommended Solution: Childcare

If the work cannot be done during nap time or after the child goes to sleep, the best solution is to find a babysitter for those two hours daily.

**Why this is better than the confined hallway situation:**
- Two hours playing in a group situation with a loving sitter can actually enrich the child's life
- The child may have an adjustment period, but this is normal and manageable
- This is far healthier than the messages the child receives from two hours behind a baby gate howling for an unresponsive parent

### Alternative Scheduling Options to Explore

- Can the work be done at home during nap time?
- Can the work be done in the evening after the child goes to sleep?
- Can the child learn to nap at the workplace so the parent can work during the nap?

## Key Reframe: What the Child Is Really Communicating

The screaming is not the child trying to manipulate or get their way. It is an emergency response of such dire proportions that the child simply cannot focus on anything else until they reconnect with the parent.

The child's behavior makes complete sense from their perspective. They are communicating a legitimate need in the only way available to them. The question is not "how do I get my child to stop protesting this situation?" but rather "how do I meet both my need to work and my child's developmental needs?"
