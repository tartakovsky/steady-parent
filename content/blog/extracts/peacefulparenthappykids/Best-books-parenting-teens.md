# Recommended Books on Parenting Teens

## Source Context
This content comes from Peaceful Parent Happy Kids (peacefulparenthappykids.com), a parenting resource website. The page provides book recommendations for parents of teenagers.

## Key Recommendation

**Mike Riera's approach to parenting teens** receives the strongest endorsement. The author states they "can't say enough good things" about his methodology. If a parent is only going to purchase one book on maintaining a good relationship with their teenager, Riera's work is recommended as the starting point.

## Content Limitations

The original page relies heavily on Amazon affiliate links with book cover images that were not captured in the source material. The author acknowledges this technical limitation, noting that some browsers may not display the embedded Amazon book links. A downloadable PDF list of recommended books is available as an alternative.

## Target Audience
- Parents of **early teens** (approximately ages 11-13)
- Parents of **teenagers** (approximately ages 13-19)

## What This Source Does NOT Contain

Due to the nature of the scraped content (which relied on embedded Amazon widgets), the actual list of specific book titles beyond Riera's work was not captured. The source mentions "some fabulous suggestions" (plural), indicating multiple recommendations exist, but only the Riera endorsement came through in text form.
