# The Feingold Diet and Behavioral Issues in Children

## Core Concept: Diet as a Behavioral Intervention

The **Feingold diet** is presented as a dietary intervention that can dramatically reduce behavioral problems in children, including hyperactivity, tantrums, aggression, sleep problems, and even suicidal thoughts. The fundamental premise is that certain food additives and natural substances can trigger severe behavioral responses in susceptible children, and removing these triggers can produce rapid, sometimes dramatic calming effects.

## Evidence and Scientific Support

Dr. Laura Markham confirms there is **strong scientific evidence** correlating the following with ADHD:
- Food coloring
- Some other additives
- Pesticide intake from ordinary foods

This provides clinical backing for the experiential reports from families using the diet.

## The Feingold Program: What It Eliminates

The diet primarily targets:
- **Artificial colors** (specifically mentioned as causing problems)
- Various additives (the original Feingold focus)
- **Corn syrup** (while not specifically eliminated by Feingold, the food guide flags products containing it because it is "known to cause so many problems")

**Important distinction**: The parent specifically identified that it was corn syrup, not artificial ingredients, causing problems in her children after Halloween candy. She knew this because she had used all-natural candy to trade for what her kids collected, yet problems still occurred with the corn-syrup-containing natural candy.

## Timeline and Response Patterns

**Rapid response is possible**: The adopted daughter became "CALM for the first time in her whole life" within **three days** of beginning the program. This child had multiple diagnoses:
- Mosaic Down Syndrome
- ADHD
- Sensory Integration Disorder (SID)
- Sydenham's Chorea (a post-strep neurological disorder)
- Possible Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE)
- Hyperthyroidism

Despite being described as "VERY bright," she had serious trouble with impulsivity and "a LOT of hyper behaviors." The diet addressed the behavioral symptoms across this complex diagnostic picture.

**Subtle responses become clear through infractions**: The biological son (age 4 at diet start) had a more subtle initial response. The dramatic nature of his sensitivity only became apparent when he consumed eliminated foods. Specific triggers identified:
- Red apples
- Green grapes
- Artificial colors

These sent him "straight through the roof, in minutes" - demonstrating that some children's responses may not be obvious until you see the contrast created by accidental exposures.

## Effectiveness Claims and Caveats

**The diet works "the majority of the time"** according to this parent's assertion.

**Why some families report failure**: The parent argues that families who claim they tried the diet unsuccessfully often "didn't totally follow the program" and therefore "saw little to no results." This suggests the diet requires **complete adherence** to work properly - partial implementation may produce no benefit.

**Dr. Markham's more measured view**: "It doesn't work for all kids, but when it does work, I hear it's like a miracle." This acknowledges both the dramatic success cases and the reality that it's not universal.

## Reframing the "Difficulty" Objection

**Common professional objection**: Many professionals describe the Feingold diet as "difficult" and use this to discourage families, often recommending medication instead.

**Counter-argument**: The parent reframes what's actually difficult:
- Having an out-of-control child IS difficult
- Drugging a child and watching them experience side effects IS difficult
- "Choosing a different brand of ice cream is NOT difficult"

This reframing shifts the comparison from "easy medication vs. hard diet" to "hard life with symptoms vs. manageable dietary changes."

## Benefits Beyond Behavior

The parent reports:
- Children "function at the highest level of their ability"
- No drugs needed
- No labels put on children
- Family is "more peaceful"
- Parent feels "WONDERFUL" and has "control over many of my family's issues, where I felt helpless before"

This highlights the **empowerment aspect**: parents gain agency over their children's behavioral challenges rather than feeling dependent on medical interventions.

## Context: Family Background

The testimonial comes from a mother of **nine children, ages 2-30**, with three middle children adopted who have special needs. The adopted daughter with multiple diagnoses was adopted from Russia at 5 months old and started the diet at approximately 8 years old. This demonstrates the diet being applied across both biological and adopted children with varying needs.
