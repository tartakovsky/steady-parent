## Overview

This source is an index page for Dr. Laura Markham's four-video series on sibling rivalry. It contains brief descriptions of the video topics but not the actual video transcripts or detailed content.

**Key framing**: Sibling conflict is identified as the challenge that stresses parents out more than any other child-raising issue. However, parents have more power than they realize to help their children get along.

**Core promise**: The approach aims to transform sibling tensions, stop fighting, and raise children who become friends for life.

## Video Series Structure

The series is organized into four videos covering distinct aspects of sibling dynamics:

### Video 1: What Causes Sibling Rivalry

Focus: Understanding the root causes of sibling rivalry and how parents can intervene more positively to support healthy sibling relationships.

The emphasis on "intervening more positively" suggests that common parental interventions may be counterproductive, and understanding causes enables better responses.

### Video 2: Intervening in a Sibling Fight

Focus: Teaching parents how to intervene in sibling fights with three specific goals:
1. Both children feel heard
2. Children learn to express their needs without attacking each other
3. Children learn skills to work things out independently

The ultimate outcome is that parents eventually won't need to intervene because children will have developed conflict resolution skills.

### Video 3: Healing Sibling Resentment

Focus: Addressing situations where a child carries resentment toward their sibling (described as a "chip on the shoulder").

Two-part approach:
1. Melting the resentment
2. Increasing positive sibling interactions to create space for affection to grow

This suggests that reducing negative feelings alone isn't sufficient; positive interactions must be actively cultivated for affection to develop.

### Video 4: How Parents Can Reduce Sibling Rivalry

Focus: Dr. Laura Markham shares **six research-based secrets** to prevent and heal sibling rivalry.

This video appears to synthesize prevention strategies and healing approaches into an actionable framework.
