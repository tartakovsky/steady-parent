## The Core Misconception About Resilience

**Resilience does not come from being toughened up or thrown into difficulties.** The common belief that frustration is good for kids because the world is full of frustrations is flawed. This reasoning is compared to saying children should sleep without blankets because it's a cold, cruel world. The goal is not to harden children against hardship but to raise kids who have the resourcefulness to find or make blankets, and to create a warmer world where everyone can find blankets.

**Resilience comes from learning that even when things go wrong, you can pick yourself up, try again, and succeed, with support.** The critical element is that recovery and eventual success must happen with support available.

## Why Failure Alone Does Not Build Resilience

The idea that failure builds resilience has become commonplace, but this is only half the picture. **When children fail repeatedly without support to keep trying, they learn only that they are failures.** The lesson internalized is not perseverance but inadequacy.

**Resilience comes not from failing, but from the experience of learning that even when everything goes wrong, you can keep going and ultimately succeed.** This requires two things:
1. At least some experience of success
2. Lots of emotional support

We learn from overcoming challenges, but we learn best when we also experience success. Success motivates us to tackle more difficult challenges. **Failure without support creates a negative cycle: lack of confidence leads to giving up, which leads to more failure.** Mastery, on the other hand, begets mastery. Each success builds confidence for the next challenge.

## The Helicopter Parenting Anxiety

Parents are told they over-protect their children, preventing them from gaining confidence through handling things themselves. This creates anxiety for parents because the line between appropriate support and helicoptering is rarely clear. The observation is made that a helicopter parent is often just someone who hovers more than you do, highlighting the subjectivity of this judgment.

All parents want to protect their children because that is the parental job. But they also don't want to stymie the development of self-confidence, resourcefulness, and resilience. The tension between protection and independence is real and unavoidable.

**What we know for certain:** The more practice kids have in solving their own problems, managing their lives, and overcoming obstacles to meet their goals, whether in autonomous play or daily life, the more confidence and competence they develop.

The challenge is hitting the sweet spot: giving appropriate support and protection while allowing enough independence to foster confidence and competence.

## Strategy 1: Stop Controlling and Start Coaching

**Coaches help kids develop skills, but kids play the game.** The parent's job is to support the child so they can flourish and develop.

**Doing things FOR your child robs them of the opportunity to become competent.** The child never learns they can do it themselves.

**Doing things WITH your child teaches them how and builds confidence.** The learning happens through shared activity where the child is an active participant.

This approach requires parents to manage their own anxiety and let go of their need to control. The impulse to control often comes from parental anxiety rather than the child's actual needs.

## Strategy 2: Perfection Is Not the Goal

**Resist the temptation to improve on your child's task unless the outcome is vitally important.** Intervention undermines a child's confidence because it communicates that their effort was not good enough.

The key question to ask: Is this outcome actually vital, or am I intervening because of my own standards? Most outcomes are not vital enough to justify undermining confidence.

## Strategy 3: Let Them Try From the Earliest Age

**Rein in your own anxiety.** This does not mean abandoning the child to the task.

The approach:
1. Stand by, smiling, ready to be helpful in whatever way actually helps your child
2. Keep your mouth shut and your hands to yourself except to give appropriate encouragement
3. Only help when you really need to

**What not to do:** Clucking anxiously about how worried you are as your child climbs a play structure may make you feel better and may impress other parents with your attentiveness, but it does not help your child. In fact, it limits them. It communicates that the situation is dangerous and that you don't believe they can handle it.

**What to do instead:** Ask if they are keeping themselves safe. Stand by and spot them. Smile proudly. When they succeed, say something like: "Look at you! I knew you could do it!"

**Why this works:** If the child falls, you're there to catch them. It is precisely this safety net that allowed them to try it in the first place. The confidence to attempt something comes from knowing support is available if needed.

## Strategy 4: Build Confidence Through Manageable Challenges (Scaffolding)

**Scaffolding** is the framework you give your child on which they build. Emotional development researchers use this term for a specific approach to supporting learning.

Scaffolding takes several forms:
- Demonstrating how to do something
- Using words to suggest a strategy
- Simply spotting them (being present as a safety net)

**Why scaffolding works:** This assistance helps children succeed when trying something new. Small successes achieved with your help give them confidence to try new things themselves.

**The deeper lesson of scaffolding:** It teaches children that nonjudgmental help is always available if they need it. You want your kids to trust this deep in their bones before they hit adolescence. The belief that help is available without judgment is foundational to risk-taking and growth throughout life.

## Strategy 5: Don't Set Children Up for Failure

**Offer structure to help children succeed.** The question of whether to step in when you see failure ahead or let them learn a lesson is always a hard call.

**The case against pure rescue:** Rescuing children can prevent them from learning important lessons.

**The case against letting children fail:** When children see their parents stand by and let them fail, they experience that as not being loved. The lesson they learn is not that they should have practiced that clarinet or read the directions on that science kit. Instead, they learn:
- That they are failures
- That they cannot manage themselves
- That their parents did not care enough to help them not be failures
- That their parents did not teach them to manage themselves

**The key question: Is stepping in rescuing them?** That depends entirely on how it's done.

**Bad example of stepping in:** Taking over the science fair project and doing half of it the night before it's due. This is worse than rescuing because:
1. The child learns you will bail them out if they goof off
2. The child learns that they are incompetent (you had to do it for them)

**Good example of stepping in:** Helping the child each step of the way to organize their ideas and their work, while resisting the impulse to improve on the project yourself. The child completes the job hugely proud and having learned something about how to plan and execute a complex project.

**The critical distinction:** Help with process and organization, not with content improvement. The work remains theirs.

## Strategy 6: Autonomous Play Builds Inner Resourcefulness

**One of the best ways to build both competence and confidence is through autonomous play.** When children engage in unstructured play without constant adult direction, they are practicing critical life skills, not just having fun.

What children practice during autonomous play:
- Negotiating the rules of a game
- Solving disputes
- Figuring out how to build a fort that won't fall down

**Skills developed through this practice:**
- Learning to manage challenges
- Finding creative solutions on their own
- Developing emotional intelligence through reading the cues of playmates
- Taking others' perspectives
- Working through conflicts

**The outcome: Inner resourcefulness.** This is the sense that "I can handle this," even when things go wrong. Over time, kids gain confidence in their ability to solve problems, navigate relationships, and bounce back from setbacks.

The key element is that the play is autonomous, meaning without constant adult direction. Adult direction removes the problem-solving requirement that builds resourcefulness.

## Strategy 7: Encourage, Encourage, Encourage, and Teach Self-Encouragement

**All humans need encouragement.** This is presented as a universal truth about human psychology.

**Why encouragement matters beyond the moment:** Encouraging your child keeps them feeling more positive and motivated in the short term. More importantly, it gives them an inner voice that will help them encourage themselves for the rest of their life.

**Research finding:** Kids who talk themselves through difficult situations find it easier to master difficult tasks. Self-talk is an actual skill that improves performance.

**Practical application: Give children maxims to repeat as mantras when things get tough:**
- "Practice makes progress!"
- "If you don't succeed, try, try again!"
- "I think I can, I think I can!"

These phrases are designed to help manage frustration.

**Why mantras matter:** When your son goofs a piece on the piano and has to start over, or your daughter strikes out with the bases loaded, they need an automatic internal comforting voice to encourage and motivate them. **If the encouraging voice is not there, the harsh criticizing voice steps in, triggered by the disappointment.** The internal voice that activates in moments of failure is either encouraging or critical. Building the encouraging voice prevents the critical one from taking over.

## Strategy 8: Describe and Empathize Instead of Evaluating

**The problem with praise:** Phrases like "Good job!" evaluate the outcome of your child's action. This creates two problems:
1. It doesn't give the child information about what was good about what they did or why you think it was good
2. It teaches the child to rely on external sources to evaluate themselves

**Better approach:** Give children the power to evaluate for themselves by describing what they did and empathizing with how they must feel.

**Example transformation:**
- Instead of: "Good job!"
- Say: "You just kept practicing and didn't give up... You must feel so good that you finished that!"

This approach:
- Describes the specific behavior (kept practicing, didn't give up)
- Connects to the child's internal experience (you must feel so good)
- Puts the evaluation in the child's hands rather than yours

## Strategy 9: Model Positive Self-Talk

**Whatever you model, your child will learn and emulate.** This is a fundamental principle of how children learn.

**The effect of positive self-talk:** It improves our mood, unlike the self-disparaging comments many of us automatically make.

**What to avoid:** If something negative about your child starts to come out of your mouth, bite your tongue. Most parents know better than to say "What an idiot!" to their child, and most can stop themselves.

**The less obvious problem:** Many parents see nothing wrong with berating themselves that way in front of their kids. Saying "What an idiot!" about yourself teaches the same lesson about how to respond to mistakes.

**The instruction:** Train yourself not to make self-disparaging comments. This is presented as a skill that can be developed through deliberate practice. It is also not good for you. Would you let anyone else talk to you that way?

## Strategy 10: Focus on Effort, Not Results

**Example phrases that focus on effort:**
- "I see you worked so hard on this."
- "How did you learn to do that?!"

**The principle:** Give positive feedback about specific things the child has control over, like hard work or perseverance. Do not focus on things they feel they have no control over, like being smart.

**Why this matters:** The point is never the product. You don't want your child resting on their laurels at age six or sixteen. **Your goal is for them to keep trying, practicing, improving.** You want them to learn that when they work hard, they can accomplish their goals.

The focus on effort creates a growth orientation. The focus on results or innate ability creates a fixed orientation where the child believes their performance reflects who they are rather than what they did.

## Strategy 11: Don't Be Afraid of Your Child's Feelings

**When your child encounters frustration, your empathy will be a critical factor in their overcoming it.** The parental response to the child's frustration shapes whether they develop resilience.

**What not to do:** Automatically jump in to remove the source of the frustration.

**What to do instead:** Give the frustration a larger context by communicating your compassion that they have to encounter this circumstance.

**Example phrases:**
- "I'm sorry this is so hard..."
- "It's really disappointing when..."
- "This isn't how you hoped it would turn out..."

**Important clarification:** It's okay for children to get frustrated and to be disappointed. Your child may cry and sulk all day.

**Why empathy works for resilience:** Your unconditional understanding helps your child grieve the disappointment. Once they're done grieving, they'll be ready to pull themselves together to try again the next day, especially when you express your confidence in them.

**This is how children develop resilience:** Through the cycle of disappointment, empathic support during grieving, and then trying again with renewed confidence.

## Strategy 12: Don't Set Your Child Up for Extra Frustration

**Natural development of frustration tolerance:** Your child will naturally develop the ability to handle increasing amounts of frustration and anxiety as they attempt more difficult challenges.

**The key insight:** Those frustrations are inherent in growing up and are guaranteed in life. There is no need to manufacture additional frustration.

**There is no benefit whatsoever to setting your child up for extra frustration or negative experience.** The belief that extra hardship builds character is directly contradicted here.

**The harm of manufactured hardship:** The child will see you setting them up for failure as evidence of your lack of caring. This is always translated in their mind as their lack of value. **This undermines resilience rather than building it.**

The logic: If the parent doesn't care enough to prevent unnecessary suffering, the child concludes they are not worth caring about. This damages the foundation (feeling valued) that resilience is built upon.

## Strategy 13: Affirm Your Child's Ability to Impact the World

**Competence and feelings of mastery are about power and derive from a child's experience of themselves as having an effect on the world.** The internal experience of competence comes from seeing that one's actions produce results.

**Example of how this works:** "If I stand on the stool, I can flip this light switch and light up the room!" The child takes action and sees a result in the world.

**Realistic limits:** All children will experience reasonable limits to their power ("I can't make the rain stop, and neither can Mommy"). This is normal and healthy.

**The principle:** The more your child has opportunities to make a difference in the world, the more they will see themselves as capable. Capability is experienced through having effects, not through being told they are capable.

## The Overarching Framework: Working Yourself Out of a Job

**The parent's job is to work themselves out of a job, and this starts when children are very young.** All kids eventually grow up and live their lives without us. This is the inevitable endpoint, and parenting should prepare children for it.

How they live will depend partly on whether parents have been able to rise above two obstacles:
1. Their own anxiety
2. Their impulse to control their child

**The roots and wings metaphor:**
- **Unconditional love is the roots.** This is the foundation, the security, the sense of being valued.
- **Confidence is the wings.** This is the capacity to venture out, take risks, and handle challenges.

**Young people who have both live bigger lives.** The outcome of getting this balance right is not just competence or resilience in isolation, but an expanded capacity for living fully.
