## Are Tantrums Normal in Older Children?

**Frequent tantrums over slight provocations are not "normal" at age eight** - they serve as a red flag indicating the child needs parental help. The child is communicating through behavior that something of critical importance is missing in their emotional development: the ability to regulate their own emotions.

A single meltdown at the end of a series of frustrations would be predictable and understandable. However, when meltdowns happen often and are triggered by seemingly minor incidents - someone looking at them on the playground, someone having something they want - this pattern reveals a deeper need for emotional support.

## The Science Behind Self-Soothing and Co-Regulation

### Why Isolation Doesn't Work

The common approach of sending children to calm down alone (in their room, a tent, etc.) is based on the belief that isolation helps children learn to self-soothe. **New brain research shows the opposite is true.**

Brain development requires children to be soothed by someone else first. This external soothing helps them develop the **neural pathways** necessary to eventually soothe themselves. The capacity for self-regulation is built through experiencing regulation with another person.

### Who Needs This Help and Why

Children who didn't develop this neural network in infancy will need help developing it during childhood. This can happen for several reasons:
- They were left to cry as infants
- They are highly sensitive by temperament
- Other developmental factors interrupted this process

**Co-regulation** (the scientific term) is the process where children "borrow" the parent's strength and calm to develop their own regulation capacity. This cannot happen when the child is isolated during distress.

## The "Backpack" Model of Stored Emotions

### Why Reactions Seem Disproportionate

Children store up their big, scary feelings, waiting for a safe place to discharge them. The concept of the **emotional "backpack"** explains why children react to minor provocations with major meltdowns.

Some children have an especially large backpack of pent-up emotion that needs release. When they feel safe enough, a small trigger provides the opportunity to let out accumulated feelings that have nothing to do with the immediate situation.

**The key insight**: While the parent may not see a reason for such a big reaction, the meltdown is actually the child processing stored feelings they haven't been able to manage, not just reacting to the current moment.

### What to Expect When You Create Safety

**Warning/prediction**: Once children feel safe enough to let these feelings out, they will use every opportunity to cry for about a week. This is normal and expected - creating safety opens the floodgates temporarily.

The payoff comes after this initial release period. Between crying episodes, and thereafter, parents will observe:
- A calmer child
- A sweeter disposition
- A happier overall state
- Deeper trust in the parent-child relationship
- Restored joy in parenting that some parents find has been missing

## Empathy as the Primary Tool

**Empathy** is identified as the most effective parenting tool for helping children develop emotional regulation.

### How to Apply Empathy During a Meltdown

**Step 1: Regulate yourself first**

Take a deep breath to calm down. You cannot offer co-regulation if you become dysregulated yourself.

Remind yourself:
- Keep breathing
- Don't take anything the child says or does personally
- Focus on how much you love them

This self-regulation enables you to stay calm and provide the safe container the child needs.

**Step 2: Stay physically present**

Instead of sending the child away, stay with them. Your presence creates safety. Being alone when very upset won't teach them what they need to learn.

**Step 3: Restore a sense of safety**

The goal is creating conditions where the child feels safe enough to have a big cry, show you all those tears and fears they've been stuffing down, and let them go.

**Step 4: Reflect feelings to show understanding**

See things from their perspective and verbalize their experience:

Example language for the marshmallow incident:
- "Oh my goodness, you didn't mean for the marshmallows to fall on the ground. You didn't realize what would happen when you threw them. And then I snapped at you. Now you feel so terrible..."

Note: At this point, the child will likely cry louder because parental acceptance of their feelings allows them to actually feel those feelings. This is progress, not escalation.

Continue reflecting:
- "I see how upset you are right now. You're crying so hard. You probably wonder if I'm mad at you, too, and that scares you."

**Step 5: Be truthful and model getting over it**

If you were indeed mad (your tone of voice let them know), acknowledge this honestly while also demonstrating how to move past it:
- "I do feel bad, because I wanted a marshmallow - but don't worry, I'll get over my disappointment. Your feelings are a lot more important to me than a bag of marshmallows."

This models self-regulation - the exact skill you're trying to teach.

**Step 6: Apologize for your contribution**

- "I'm sorry I spoke so sharply when you dropped them. I know you didn't do it on purpose."

**Important framing**: You might think the child's offense (dropping marshmallows) is worse than yours (snapping at them). But you're the adult. Children learn to apologize by seeing parents model apology. Without this modeling, apology won't be learned.

**Step 7: Reconnection after calm returns**

As the child begins feeling understood, they will eventually calm down. This is when physical comfort (hugging) and reassurance of love become appropriate.

Transition language:
- "I'm so sorry you got so upset. Mostly I want to get back to that nice feeling the three of us had, sitting by the fire together. Do you think you're ready to calm down and snuggle with me and watch the fire?"

## When to Teach Lessons (Timing is Critical)

### Not During the Meltdown

The meltdown is not the time to ensure the child has "learned the lesson" about proper behavior (like walking marshmallows over instead of throwing them).

### Much Later - Probably Tomorrow

Wait until everyone is calm and feeling good. Then all it takes is one question, asked with a genuine smile of commiseration:
- "Next time you have to pass someone the bag of marshmallows, what do you think is the best way to do that?"

Regardless of the answer, follow this with a big hug.

## Why Criticism Doesn't Work

**Kids don't learn by being criticized.** They learn to be careful the same way adults do: by seeing the other person's instantly disappointed face as the consequence occurs.

Adding criticism to natural consequences makes children defensive rather than reflective.

**Judgment develops from experience**, often from bad experience. The motivation to do better comes from love and from learning through experience that certain approaches have unwanted results.

## The Long-Term Investment

### What to Expect

Because the child didn't learn emotional regulation earlier in life, developing this skill may take time - **potentially up to a year** of using this empathic technique every time the child has a meltdown.

### The Commitment Required

The parent must commit to empathizing every single time the child is even a little upset - not just during major meltdowns.

### The Guaranteed Results

With consistent application:
- The child will stop having meltdowns
- They will become the kind of person who would "walk across town" to bring you something
- They will never taunt their sibling when the sibling is upset

## Handling Siblings During Meltdowns

### Understanding the Older Sibling's Reaction

When an older sibling (in this case, a 14-year-old) mocks or taunts the melting-down child, several possible motivations may be at play:
- The lovely family moment was interrupted with shrieks
- The sibling's distress actually upset them emotionally
- Jealousy leads them to needle their sibling whenever possible
- The family culture treats kids being mean to each other as normal
- Embarrassment so intense they'd do anything to make the noise stop
- Simple frustration about missing out on something (wanting marshmallows)

### The Empathy Deficit Connection

A teen who mocks a distressed sibling is behaving like a toddler who clobbers another shrieking toddler. **This is the reaction of someone who hasn't yet developed much empathy.**

### The Prescription: Same Approach, Different Application

Help the older child develop more empathy by offering them understanding too.

**Step 1: Private conversation afterward**

Ask how they felt about the meltdown incident. Reflect back their feelings:
- "Sounds like you were mortified when your sister started screaming in the middle of the campground. That made you want to do anything to shut her up. I understand. I was pretty embarrassed too."

Listen and let them elaborate.

**Step 2: Shift perspective once venting winds down**

Ask what they think their sibling felt. Without attacking them, help them acknowledge that:
- The sibling's feelings were real (even if inconvenient)
- Taunting was unkind
- The taunting made things worse

**Step 3: Set clear limits**

Combine empathy with boundary-setting:
- "Please don't taunt your sister. That's the rule in our family. If you can't say something supportive when someone is upset, please stay out of it until they calm down."

This combination of empathy plus limits will eventually encourage empathy development in the older child.

## The Core Message to Communicate (Verbally or Through Behavior)

The learning the child needs is emotional, not intellectual. The message to convey, whether stated explicitly or communicated through consistent empathic response:

"I know your strong feelings scare you. I won't leave you alone with them and I'll show you how to accept them and let them go, so they don't overwhelm you and make you act out. Feelings can be scary, but they are just part of being human. In fact, your emotions are a gift, a message. I will help you learn how to manage yourself. It's going to be ok. You are safe and loved, no matter what."

The specific message of any given incident (like the marshmallow fiasco: you can't throw a bag of marshmallows without breaking it, and you feel terrible when you disappoint your parent) is secondary to this overarching emotional learning.

## Practical Note

When asked by authorities (like campground staff) about the disturbance, a simple face-saving explanation like "my daughter stepped on a bee" sidesteps the need for lengthy explanations while addressing the immediate social concern.
