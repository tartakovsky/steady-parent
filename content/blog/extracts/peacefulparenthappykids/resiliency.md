## What Resilience Is and Why It Matters

**Resilience** is defined as the capacity to handle adverse experiences constructively, recover from them, and integrate them in a way that allows a person to find growth and meaning as they move forward. Children naturally experience big feelings daily, including "negative" emotions like disappointment, grief, and anger. Resilient children recover more quickly from these experiences and often learn and grow from setbacks, gaining confidence and resourcefulness in the process.

A resilient child becomes a happy adult. Resilience is about rising above adversity, overcoming challenges, making the best of difficult situations, and using hardships as lessons for growth. Since all children face some adversity on their journey to adulthood, resilience serves as a prerequisite for healthy development. Building resilience in your child essentially vaccinates them against future difficulties.

## The Research Foundation: Three Key Findings

Research on resilience has established three important facts:

1. **Genetics influences resilience** - Tendencies like anxiety can affect a child's baseline resilience.

2. **The parent-child relationship is the most significant factor** - This relationship helps children develop a lifelong sense of safety and a nervous system that recovers from stress more quickly.

3. **Resilience skills can be learned** - Although everyone is born with different innate tendencies toward more or less resilience, anyone can develop greater resilience through learning and practice.

## The Critical Misconception About Failure

There is a common misconception that children develop resilience by failing. This is incorrect. **Children develop resilience by dealing successfully with failure.** The distinction is essential:

- When children have support to get up and try again, they learn they can survive adversity and come out okay.
- When a child lacks that support, all they learn from failing is that they are the kind of person who fails.

The key question becomes: what kind of support helps a child turn failure into confidence that no matter what happens, they can handle it?

## The Five Foundational Experiences for Building Resilience

### 1. Feeling Safe, Cared For, and Understood - Even When Things Go Wrong

The security of knowing someone is watching out for them allows a child to explore, to risk bumps, disappointment, and hurt feelings, and to emerge intact on the other side. When children feel safe, they develop a nervous system that is less alarmist, enabling them to recover more easily from upsets.

**What NOT to do:** Don't try to talk your child out of their feelings when something disappointing happens (like not getting a part in a play).

**What TO do:** Empathize with their disappointment and honor their grief. With your support, they will feel those big emotions and move past them, rather than freezing them inside (which locks in the feeling of failure). Through this process, they learn from experience that they can tolerate any emotion they feel and come out the other side, and that the sun will come up the next day.

### 2. The Experience of Solving Problems

Every child faces problems daily. Working through those problems builds confidence to face tougher challenges in the future. Your child needs to know you have their back.

**The parent's role is NOT to solve the problem.** Your job is to support your child so they feel empowered to tackle the challenge themselves.

**What NOT to do:** Don't lecture, teach, or solve the problem for your child. This teaches them they cannot solve things themselves.

**What TO do:** Your goal is to support your child to feel more capable by providing backup so they can successfully handle the challenge. In the future, they will have more confidence when they hit roadblocks because they think of themselves as someone who can solve problems.

**Practical approach:** When your child gets into a jam, manage your own anxiety and resist jumping in to rescue. Instead, support them to brainstorm possible solutions and their outcomes. Use questions like: "Hmm... yes, you could do that. I wonder what might happen then?"

### 3. The Experience of "Yet"

When your child gets frustrated at failure or feels they are not good at something, empower them with the word **"YET."**

**Example phrasings:**
- "You're just not as good at that as you want to be YET."
- "You don't know how to do that YET."
- "You've learned lots of hard things so far in your life, and your brain is always excited to learn more. It just hasn't learned that yet."
- "You haven't figured out how to succeed at that YET, but you will if you keep trying."

### 4. Encountering Difficult Emotions and Learning to Manage Them Constructively

Resilience depends on being able to handle negative emotions. It is natural for young children to crumble when overwhelmed by their emotions. However, as kids get older, they can develop enough **emotional regulation** to tolerate the disappointment of losing or the frustration of practicing as they master their craft. They recover more quickly from upsets, are more likely to re-apply themselves, and keep trying when things are hard.

**The most important parenting strategy:** Accept and allow all emotions, even when you need to limit behavior. The distinction between emotions (always acceptable) and behavior (sometimes needs limits) is fundamental.

### 5. The Experience of Mastery

Developing **grit** - the quality of pushing through obstacles while pursuing something you are passionate about - depends on the child working hard to accomplish their own goals. This could mean mastering a jump shot, writing a short story, perfecting a recipe, or planning a camping trip.

**Critical distinction:** The motivation must come from within the child, not from wanting to please parents. This means it has to be the child's own interest, not something imposed on them.

**Practical challenge:** Make sure your child gets plenty of time to initiate and pursue their own passions. This is not always easy in an age of homework and screen time, but it is essential for building grit and resilience.

## The Umbrella Metaphor for Resilience

You cannot protect your child from the rain that falls in every life. What you can do is ensure they know how to find an umbrella and have the confidence to make it through the storm.

**What NOT to do:** You don't teach resilience by withholding the umbrella and making them stand in the rain.

**What TO do:** You provide backup, coaching them repeatedly so they learn how to find or build an umbrella and develop the emotional strength to do that even when the rain pours down.

The practice starts now. Someday, your child will look back and remember that they have dealt with hard times before and came out fine. Your unwavering love is what will get them there.

## What a Resilient Person Looks Like: The Constellation of Traits

Resilience is actually a constellation of traits that work together. Resilient people:

- Are more likely to accept what they cannot change while still working to change what they can
- Are guided by an inner compass and sense of meaning or purpose
- Are more likely to be optimistic, choosing to look for silver linings
- Are connected to others, both offering and receiving support
- Are more likely to have a spiritual or religious practice in which they find meaning

**Important insight:** These qualities are choices. The more parents model these characteristics in their own lives, the more children will learn them as a way of life.

## The Genetics and Environment Interaction

Several traits contributing to resilience are at least partially inherited. Children who are naturally more adaptable, more outgoing, and more emotionally even-keeled have a head start in developing resilience. Specific genes have been identified that seem to confer some degree of resilience:
- **5HTT** - influences serotonin
- **OPRM1** - promotes attachment

However, what children actually experience is always the interaction between genetics and environment. **Regardless of your child's genetic makeup, you can give them a foundation of resilience through their early experiences.** These include healthy attachment bonding and positive interactions with adults that help the child develop an unshakable belief that the world is a friendly place that welcomes and assists them.

## The Power of Having Someone Believe in You

Many studies on children who survive adversity despite inadequate parenting have found that these children had someone - a teacher, a coach, a grandmother - who believed in them 100% and gave them nurturing and encouragement from which they could springboard.

**How do these children piece together limited support into enough of a security blanket to keep growing?** Most researchers suggest the answer lies in their earliest relationships. Those with enough positive parenting, where they felt loved and valued, are able to build on that foundation throughout life, even if later building materials are scarce.

**The mechanism works as follows:**
1. Every child needs to know that someone is in their corner, rooting for them
2. From that experience, they internalize a sense of their own value and potential
3. This internal sense cheers them on even when times are rough
4. Additionally, it allows them to find and use support from outside, in the form of encouraging adults who help them along their path

## How Sensitive Parenting Modifies Genetic Expression

Sensitive parenting can modify the way children's inherited tendencies are expressed. One striking study illustrated this with shy children:

- **Shy children who receive excellent parenting** are able to use their heightened sensitivity to others to become leaders
- **Shy children who are poorly parented** may find that their shyness becomes insecurity that plagues them throughout their lives

**Key insight:** Genetic makeup may be critical, but only when combined with environment does it become destiny. This demonstrates that parenting quality can fundamentally alter how genetic predispositions manifest in a child's life.

## Dr. Edward Hallowell on the Source of Resilience

"Where does resilience come from?... It comes from knowing that you never have to be alone... If you feel connected, you will always be able to deal with adversity. The skills we need to deal with adversity begin with a feeling of 'I can handle this.' It is a feeling of 'No matter what happens, I can find a solution'; a feeling of 'I have dealt with hard times and come out fine before'; a feeling of 'Even when I feel lost, I always have somewhere to turn.'"

This quote captures the emotional foundation of resilience: connection, self-efficacy, past success, and knowing support is available.
