# Why Spanking Is Ineffective and Harmful: The Research-Based Case for Alternative Discipline

## Core Finding: Spanking Produces Worse Behavior, Not Better

The central conclusion from thirty years of research is unambiguous: **corporal punishment makes children's behavior worse over time, not better**. This finding has been replicated across numerous peer-reviewed studies with remarkable consistency (99% agreement among research studies on the negative effects).

The only positive outcome ever demonstrated from spanking is **immediate compliance**. However, this short-term gain comes at the cost of **decreased long-term compliance**. Parents who spank are essentially trading future cooperation for momentary obedience.

## The Nine Negative Outcomes Linked to Corporal Punishment

Research has repeatedly linked corporal punishment to nine categories of negative outcomes:

1. **Increased aggression** - Children who are hit are more likely to hit others, including peers, siblings, and eventually spouses as adults
2. **Increased delinquency** - Antisocial behavior actually increases with more spanking
3. **Mental health problems** - Including depression and anxiety
4. **Drug and alcohol use** - Physical punishment is associated with substance use problems
5. **Problems in parent-child relationships** - Fear is established rather than love
6. **Defiance** - Spanked children become more defiant, not less
7. **Low frustration tolerance** - They become frustrated easily and demand immediate satisfaction
8. **Temper tantrums** - Spanked children have more tantrums, not fewer
9. **Physical aggression toward others** - Including lashing out at people and animals

## The Gershoff 2013 Study: Key Findings

**Elizabeth Gershoff**, recognized as the leading researcher on spanking in the United States, led a team that reviewed two decades of research and confirmed:

- Children who are spanked exhibit higher rates of depression, anxiety, drug use, and aggression as they age
- Children who experience more severe corporal punishment show **less gray matter in their frontal cortex** (brain damage)
- Their **amygdalas become more hyper-vigilant** (permanently elevated stress response)

## The 5-Year-Old Study: Behavioral Outcomes

A study comparing spanked versus non-spanked children at age five found that spanked children were more likely to:

- Be defiant
- Demand immediate satisfaction of wants and needs
- Become frustrated easily
- Have temper tantrums
- Lash out physically against other people or animals

This directly contradicts the intuition that spanking teaches children to behave better. The data shows it teaches them to behave worse.

## The IQ Impact

Research from Science Daily found that **IQs of children ages 2 to 4 who were not spanked were 5 points higher four years later** than the IQs of those who were spanked. Spanking has measurable cognitive consequences.

## Why Spanking Fails: The Teaching Problem

**Discipline means "to teach."** Spanking fails as a teaching tool because of what it actually teaches:

1. **It teaches children to be afraid of parents** - Fear is not a foundation for love or genuine respect
2. **It teaches sneakiness** - Children learn to avoid getting caught rather than avoiding wrong behavior
3. **It teaches children they are bad** - This self-concept makes them more likely to behave badly
4. **It teaches violence as problem-solving** - Children learn that hitting smaller, weaker people is acceptable when you want something
5. **It externalizes the locus of control** - Children only behave because an authority figure forces them to, rather than developing internal motivation to behave well. This prevents them from becoming self-disciplined adults.

The hypocrisy of "I'm going to hit you because you hit your sister" is not lost on children. They observe the contradiction and learn from what parents do, not what parents say.

## The Cycle of Violence: Intergenerational Transmission

A critical insight: **adults who were not spanked as children don't spank their kids**. It simply feels wrong to them. They find other ways to guide their children, and their children turn out fine.

Conversely, those who were spanked tend to think it's acceptable because they "turned out fine." The article challenges this reasoning: if you turned out fine, it was despite the spanking, not because of it. And you would likely be healthier emotionally if you hadn't been spanked.

Large peer-reviewed studies show:
- The more children are hit, the more likely they are to hit others
- The more parents spank for antisocial behavior, the more antisocial behavior increases
- As adults, spanked children are more likely to hit their spouses

Spanking perpetuates violence across generations.

## Brain Research on Stress and Child Development

**Dr. Allan Schore** (UCLA School of Medicine, 1996) demonstrated that:

- The stress hormone **cortisol** damages nerve connections in significant areas of an infant's brain
- When brain areas responsible for bonding, emotional control, and attachment are not nurtured in healthy ways, those areas remain undeveloped or underdeveloped
- The damage from stress is not just behavioral but structural

**Dr. Brazy** (Duke University) and **Ludington-Hoe** (Case Western University) showed that prolonged crying in infants causes:

- Increased blood pressure in the brain
- Elevated stress hormones
- Obstructed blood drainage from the brain
- Decreased oxygenation to the brain

Their conclusion: **caregivers should answer cries swiftly, consistently, and comprehensively**.

## The Alternative: Age-Appropriate Limits with Empathy

The article emphasizes that spanking is not only harmful but **totally unnecessary**. When children are raised with:

- Age-appropriate expectations
- Clear limits
- Empathy when limits are set

They tend to behave and cooperate naturally. These children don't need much discipline at all and grow into self-disciplined adults.

## Practical Strategy: What to Do When You're Angry

When you're so angry you want to hit:

1. **Tell your children you're taking a timeout** - Model the behavior you want them to learn
2. **Remove yourself physically** - Go into the bathroom, run the water, calm yourself down
3. **Use the time to get calm, not to justify your anger** - This distinction is crucial
4. **When you come out, tell them you need to think about what they did** - But right now you need to do something else (fix dinner, laundry, etc.)
5. **Ask them to be "little angels"** - Set the expectation for their behavior while you're processing
6. **Tell them you will talk when everyone is calm** - Schedule the teaching moment for later
7. **Follow through** - Have the conversation when everyone is regulated

### Why This Works Better

- **Flight or fight hormones block learning** - Children cannot absorb lessons when their stress response is activated
- **Modeling emotional regulation teaches emotional regulation** - When children see you manage your anger constructively, they learn how to do the same
- **Teaching from a calm state is more effective** - Both you and the child can think clearly

## The Dr. Sears Insight on Anger and Spanking

The spanking guidelines usually warn to "never spank in anger." Dr. Sears points out a revealing truth: **if this guideline were faithfully observed, 99% of spanking wouldn't occur**. Once a parent has calmed down, they can come up with a more appropriate method of correction.

This reveals that spanking is fundamentally about parental anger management failure, not about child discipline. The impulse to spank comes from the parent's dysregulated emotional state, not from a reasoned assessment of what the child needs to learn.

Furthermore, **controlling angry impulses is one of the things you're trying to teach children**. Spanking actively sabotages this teaching by modeling the opposite behavior.

## Marshall Rosenberg's Perspective

The article opens with a quote from **Marshall Rosenberg**: "Punishment is the root of violence on our planet." This frames corporal punishment not just as ineffective parenting but as contributing to broader societal violence.

## Key Research Sources

The article cites extensive research including:

- **Elizabeth Gershoff** (leading U.S. researcher on spanking) - Multiple studies from 2002-2013
- **Joan Durrant** (University of Manitoba, leading Canadian researcher)
- **Berlin et al. (2009)** - Study on correlates and consequences across White, African American, and Mexican American toddlers
- **Gershoff & Grogan-Kaylor (2013)** - New meta-analyses
- Studies published in Child Development, Science Daily, Time Magazine, Canadian Medical Association Journal

The consistency across multiple researchers, methodologies, and populations strengthens the finding that spanking's negative effects are universal, not culture-specific.
