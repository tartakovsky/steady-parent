# Eight Essential Discussions to Have with Your Teen Before College

## The Emotional Foundation: Managing the Transition

### Why Parents Struggle During This Period

The enormity of letting go of your child and wondering if they're ready can make parents terribly anxious. This anxiety often manifests as fighting about things that don't matter, which is counterproductive. The underlying cause is parental fear, not actual problems with the teen.

### The Evolution of the Parent-Teen Relationship

Throughout the teen years, your relationship has been steadily evolving. You've been biting your tongue and letting go more and more as your teen steps up to manage themselves and their responsibilities. This is rarely a graceful dance because teens can be mature one moment and thoughtless the next. However, by the time they leave home, all the love and lessons shared should mean they're ready for the next adventure.

### Critical Mindset Shift for Parents

**Take a breath, have a private cry, and let go some more.** The key insight here is that your anxiety should not increase your teen's anxiety. It's important for them to make some decisions the way they want to, regardless of what you think. There's a specific psychological mechanism at work: every time you let them lead, that's a vote of confidence in their maturity, and they'll act more mature. Confidence begets competence.

### Practical vs. Emotional Preparation

Teaching them to do laundry and buying a lamp for the dorm room may be important, but those tasks aren't nearly as essential as helping them prepare mentally and emotionally for the life changes and rites of passage ahead. The tactical items are easier to figure out; the emotional and psychological readiness requires deliberate conversation.

## Discussion 1: Affirmation and Unconditional Support

### What to Communicate

Tell your child how proud you are of them and how happy you are to be their parent. Explain that most of your job is done but that you will always be there if they need you.

### The 24/7 Promise

Be sure they know you mean it when you say they can call you 24/7 for any reason at all. This isn't just reassurance; it's establishing that no situation is too embarrassing, too late, or too complicated to reach out. This becomes especially critical in discussions about alcohol, drugs, and safety situations.

### Expressing Confidence

Tell them you have confidence in their judgment. This explicit statement of trust is psychologically important. It sets expectations and signals that you believe they're capable of making good decisions.

## Discussion 2: Listening to Their Hopes, Fears, and Expectations

### The Approach

Ask questions, listen, reassure, and brainstorm with them. The emphasis is on listening, not lecturing. Your role shifts from instructor to thought partner.

### Normalizing the Adjustment

Point out that this is a huge adjustment and they need to nurture themselves. Everyone goes through anxiety and homesickness as they adjust to college. The best cure is connecting with others who are feeling the same way. Knowing that these feelings are universal helps reduce shame and isolation.

### Key Questions to Explore

- Does she feel comfortable making friends?
- Does she feel comfortable reaching out for help if she needs it?
- If she has roommate problems, who can she turn to?
- How can she support herself if she feels stressed or depressed?
- What routines and activities will help her?

These questions prompt them to think through their support systems and coping mechanisms before they're in crisis.

## Discussion 3: Academic Preparation and Mindset

### Course Selection Strategy

Ask how they will choose which classes to take. **Ensure they're taking at least two classes they will probably love** because at least one of their classes will likely be a disappointment. This buffer of enjoyable classes helps maintain motivation when other courses are frustrating.

### Normalizing Academic Struggle

Many students find college much harder than high school and need extra tutoring, help from professors, or regular visits to the writing lab. This isn't failure; it's normal. The question to ask: If they find themselves struggling academically, who can they go to for help?

### The Value of Professor Relationships

Getting to know professors can be life changing. Ask how they might develop those relationships. There's a specific tactical insight here: **sitting in the back of the class might feel safer, but professors interpret that as a sign that the student isn't interested and isn't doing the work.** Where you sit sends a signal about your engagement.

### The Grades vs. Learning Trade-off

**Over-focusing on grades often means students take easier classes and get less pleasure out of learning.** The recommendation: tell them you'd rather they focus on learning and expanding their horizons than worry about grades. Frame it this way: while you don't want them wasting tuition dollars, their grades the first semester are not as important as creating a balanced life that includes healthy friendships and self-nurturing.

### Communication About Grades

Since parents won't have legal access to their grades, discuss how they'll feel most comfortable communicating about them. This proactive conversation prevents tension later and respects their growing autonomy while maintaining connection.

## Discussion 4: Time Management

### The Fundamental Shift

Kids spend less time in class during college than they do in high school, but they're expected to use that extra time studying, not fritter it away on screens. This unstructured time is both a freedom and a trap.

### Questions to Prompt Planning

- How will your teen organize themselves?
- Where will they study and how much time do they expect to need per class?
- What extracurricular activities do they expect to do?
- How much partying do they expect to do?
- How much gaming?
- How will they be sure they don't sleep through their alarm?
- Should they really take that 8am class or is that wishful thinking?

The last question is particularly important because it acknowledges that aspirational self-discipline often doesn't match reality, especially during freshman year.

## Discussion 5: Alcohol and Drugs

### The Risk Window

**Alcohol-related hospitalizations of college students are still on the increase, and many experts feel that the greatest risk is in the first semester**, when students are just learning how to manage their social lives and independence. The combination of newfound freedom, social pressure, and inexperience creates a dangerous period.

### The Realistic Framework

If your child will partake in alcohol, as most college students do, how can they stay safe? It IS possible for a young person to drink responsibly in the context of pregaming, beer pong, and binge drinking. The question is: what will that look like for your child specifically?

### Critical Scenarios to Discuss

- Do they know that every year college students who drive after drinking end up dead?
- If someone passes out at a party, what will they do?
- Do they understand the importance of the buddy system?
- If they go to a party with their friend and the friend gets very drunk, what will they do?
- Do they realize that taking a friend's ADHD meds is a dangerous habit, and why?

### The Ambulance Rule

**Be sure your child knows that you expect them to call an ambulance if someone else needs help, regardless of the repercussions.** This removes the calculation of "will I get in trouble" from life-threatening situations. Explicit permission and expectation to prioritize safety over consequences.

### Transportation Safety Setup

**Definitely set up an Uber and/or Lyft account and have your teen practice using it.** Tell them you will pay the bill for the car service if they ever need it for safety reasons. Your teen should never have to wonder if they can get home safely or find themselves in a car with a driver who has been drinking. This removes financial barriers to safe decisions.

## Discussion 6: Love, Sex, and Consent

### The Risk Context

**Young women in their first year of college are considered by many experts to be at higher risk of sexual assault.** This isn't meant to scare but to prompt serious preparation.

### The Central Question

Is it possible to act with integrity and to stay safe in romantic and sexual relationships in the age of hook-up culture, and what would that look like for your son or daughter?

### The Alcohol-Sex Connection

**If they feel too awkward having sex with that stranger without getting wasted, then maybe it's a bad idea to proceed with the sex.** The discomfort is information. Needing substances to feel comfortable with intimacy is a red flag about the situation itself.

### Consent Education

Every young man and woman needs to understand that **inebriated consent is not consent** and that **the absence of a Yes is effectively a No**. These are clear rules that remove ambiguity.

### For Young Men: Addressing Porn-Based Sex Education

Many teen boys have used pornography as their introduction to sex. Does he understand that porn is not a realistic depiction of healthy sex, and why? The specific reason given: most porn is male-centered and it often includes verbal or physical violence toward women. The practical skill to develop: does he know how to ask a girl what she likes in bed?

### For Young Women: Agency and Comfort

Does she feel good about pleasuring herself and comfortable saying No if she decides during foreplay that sex isn't a good idea? Self-knowledge and the ability to change your mind are both important.

### Practical Planning

- What's their plan for birth control and protection from STDs?
- Does your teen know how to follow her own inner compass and trust her instincts, so she's less likely to end up in scary situations?

### Making This an Ongoing Conversation

Hopefully, this isn't the first time you've had these discussions with your teen. Ask questions, listen, and help your teen evaluate what kind of intimate connections they really want and how they might create those. The goal is helping them clarify their own values, not imposing yours.

## Discussion 7: Health Preparedness

### Emergency Scenarios

Does your child know what to do if they break their leg or get sick? Does she know what to do if she's raped? No parent wants to think about these emergencies, but it is better for your child to be prepared. The conversation happens now so they're not figuring it out during a crisis.

### Practical Health Logistics

Be sure they know their insurance information and how to fill prescriptions. These administrative skills are often overlooked but essential for managing their own healthcare.

### The Sleep Discussion

Ask about sleep. Does your child realize that too little sleep:
- Compromises their intellectual ability
- Causes weight gain
- Makes it more likely that she'll spend time in bed with strep throat when everyone else is having fun

Framing sleep as affecting their academic performance and social life may be more motivating than abstract health warnings.

## Discussion 8: Money Management

### Establishing Financial Boundaries

Who pays for what? Is your child expected to cover their own incidentals? Will they work part time? Clear expectations prevent conflict and teach financial responsibility.

### Banking and Payment Setup

Does he need to open a bank account or can he just use his debit and/or credit card? Who will pay the credit card bill? Where is the closest ATM to where he'll be living? These logistical details matter for independence.

### Budgeting and Consequences

How will they budget their money? What will happen if they overspend? Having a plan for both expected spending and potential overruns.

### The Cost-Per-Class Calculation

**Explain that college is a privilege, a gift you are happy to help with, and you want to be sure he understands how much each class costs.** The specific technique: divide the cost of a semester by the number of classes and the number of weeks. They need to know how much they'll be wasting every time they skip class. This makes the abstract expense concrete and personal.

## How to Have These Discussions

### The Approach

Start asking questions and listen much more than you talk. The ratio matters: your job is to prompt thinking, not to deliver lectures.

### The Tone

Take a deep breath, enjoy these discussions, and be sure to stay calm and make them fun for your teen. Anxiety and lecturing shut down conversation. Calm curiosity opens it.

### Physical Connection

Every time you talk, don't forget to give your teen a big hug and say again how very proud you are of them and how lucky you are to be their parent. The affection reinforces that these conversations come from love, not control.
