# How to Use Family Meetings to Build a Closer Family

## Why Family Meetings Matter

Family meetings may initially seem stilted and artificial, but once established, they become an invaluable parenting tool. Regular family meetings serve multiple important functions:

- **Create connection** when everyone is calm rather than during conflicts
- **Teach problem-solving skills** to children in a structured environment
- **Help children feel like integral family members** with real voices and influence
- **Provide a forum** for discussing triumphs, grievances, schedules, and sibling disagreements
- **Help siblings work things out** and develop appreciation for each other

The key insight is that starting family meetings is the hard part. Once established, they become so rewarding they take on a life of their own. Starting during the preschool years creates a foundation for when family meetings become essential during more challenging developmental stages.

## Getting Started: Involve Your Kids First

Begin by asking children what one thing they would change about your family. Their answers might include wanting less yelling, more sharing from siblings, special vacations, or more screen time. Whatever they say, acknowledge it genuinely: "I hear you! I can see why you want that!"

**Critical principle**: Keep initial meetings short and fun. Length can increase as children grow older and everyone develops enjoyment of the process.

To get resistant kids to participate, add incentives like pizza or dessert, or assign children important roles such as recording secretary or keeper of the family record book.

## Practical Structure for Family Meetings

### 1. Schedule Consistency

Schedule meetings at the same time every week. This makes it easy to maintain even if one week is skipped. For example, Sunday evening dinners can become the designated family meeting time.

### 2. Agenda Building Throughout the Week

Post a sheet of paper low enough on the refrigerator that everyone can reach it. As issues arise during the week, model adding them to the agenda: "That might be a good thing to talk about at our family meeting. I'm going to add this to our agenda."

For issues between children, invite their participation: "Would you two like to put this on the agenda for our family meeting?"

**Important boundary**: Family meetings are not the time to bring up behavior issues concerning only one child. Those issues are better addressed outside of meetings. Family meetings are primarily forums for kids to get help solving issues that are not working for them in the home.

**Balance the agenda**: Keep a list of pleasant topics (planning family trips, birthday celebrations) and ensure one positive topic is added every week. If negative issues always dominate, children will stop enjoying the meetings.

### 3. Create Ritual and Ceremony

Signal that this is not ordinary time together through ritual:
- Hold hands while offering a blessing or lighting candles
- Use a **talking stick** (or decorated shell or other object) so everyone feels heard

The talking stick is a sacred tool drawn from indigenous traditions. Only the person holding it has the right to speak, while the rest of the family listens. Consider making the creation of a talking stick one of the first agenda items as a collaborative project.

## The Meeting Flow

### First: Appreciations (Every Week)

Everyone offers appreciations until every family member has appreciated every other family member:

- "I appreciate that Daddy played catch with me."
- "I appreciate that Eli helped me carry in the groceries."
- "I appreciate that Alice worked so hard to teach herself to tie her shoes."
- "I appreciate that Mom helped me make my costume for the school play."
- "I appreciate that Eli helped me build a fort."

**Why this matters**: Children love giving and receiving appreciations. This alone is reason enough for family meetings. Starting with appreciations creates positive connection before addressing any problems and serves as a powerful tool for building sibling relationships.

**When a child cannot think of anything nice to say**: This is a red flag indicating work is needed to help that child melt the chip on their shoulder. In the moment, prompt gently: "Hmm... I know sometimes you get pretty annoyed at your sister. If you were to think of one time this week when you didn't feel annoyed, what was she doing?"

Even if the answer is "She was asleep, so you could play with me!" there is something to work with. Reframe it positively: "I hear Dylan saying that he really appreciates that Madison gave him a long Special Time today with me... Thank you, Madison, for being so generous!" Madison will feel appreciated, and Dylan will see Madison as having given him something valuable.

Use such incidents as motivation to create positive interactions between siblings during the coming week, giving them something concrete to appreciate next time.

### Second: Likes and Improvements

This is the main content of the meeting. Two formats work well:

**Format A**: Use the agenda compiled during the week.

**Format B**: Everyone goes around the table sharing one thing they like about the family and one thing they would like to see improve.

This structure allows everyone to bring up issues in a positive way rather than just complaining. All issues are fair game: kids fighting, sharing household work, screen time struggles, a parent working late frequently, planning family trips, or kids dragging their feet on bedtime routines.

The scribe records the Likes each week and adds Improvement topics to the agenda along with items from the refrigerator list. **Limit agenda items to one per person per meeting** and ask kids if their topic is essential for today or can wait until the next meeting.

### Discussion Ground Rules

Children are still developing conflict resolution skills, so establish and remind about ground rules every week:

1. Everyone gets a chance to talk
2. One person talks at a time without interruption while everyone listens
3. Say what you need and want without attacking anyone
4. Be kind - only constructive feedback is allowed
5. These are blame-free meetings - our goal is always solutions
6. We are a family, we are on the same team, and we always work things out

**Facilitation techniques**:
- Use coaching skills to interpret and reflect each person's needs so no one feels wrong
- Use brainstorming (writing down everyone's ideas) to find possible solutions
- Hammer out compromises: "Hmm... sounds like that idea works for Isabel, but not Marco. Let's find something that works for everyone."
- Once there is an agreement, help children write it out in the family notebook
- Review agreements at the next meeting to see how they are working; revise if necessary

Keep this section short and upbeat. If a topic cannot be finished, defer it. Sometimes referring an issue to "the parents' committee" keeps a child from getting defensive, but try not to undermine the group process.

### Record Agreements in the Family Notebook

This is essential for referring back and revising agreements that are not working. The notebook should also include:

- **Family Rules** at the front
- **Family Motto**
- **Family Vision Statement** (articulates the values that guide your lives)

With young children, both Rules and Vision Statement should be very simple, but they can develop over time with children's input.

### Finish: Looking Forward To's

Each person describes something they are looking forward to in the coming week. This focuses on all the positive things happening in the family's life and often naturally segues into announcements.

### Close: Announcements

Announcements at the end help re-enter regular life, remind everyone of upcoming appointments, trips, and rides needed, and keep the household running smoothly. However, do not let logistics overwhelm the good feelings created during the meeting - defer logistical discussions that require real work.

### Final Closure

End with a big group hug and your family motto.

## Age-Specific Adaptations

**Under-five set**: Resist the impulse to do much business. Keep meetings short and rewarding.

**Elementary schoolers**: Add an incentive for the hard work of problem-solving (special dessert, special game afterward). Expect children to appropriate the meeting for their own concerns like being embarrassed in front of friends or negotiating allowance raises.

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Start young** - Family meetings established in preschool years will be available when you really need them later

2. **Consistency over perfection** - Same time every week makes maintenance easier

3. **Child involvement from the beginning** - Ask what they would change, assign meaningful roles

4. **Appreciations are non-negotiable** - This is the foundation that makes problem-solving possible

5. **Positive balance** - Always include pleasant topics so children continue to enjoy meetings

6. **Written records** - Document agreements so they can be reviewed and revised

7. **Age-appropriate expectations** - Keep it short for young children, add incentives for older ones

8. **Ritual matters** - The talking stick and opening ceremony signal this is special time

9. **Problem-solving focus** - The goal is solutions, not blame

10. **Family unity** - Reinforce that you are on the same team and always work things out together
