## Core Finding: Divorce Itself Is Not the Problem

The research shows that children can cope with divorce and come out just fine. However, many children whose parents divorce are emotionally wounded in a way that lingers throughout their lives. The critical distinction is that **the risk factor is not the divorce itself, but the experience children have when their parents divorce**.

This means outcomes are largely determined by how parents handle the divorce, not by the fact of separation.

## Statistical Outcomes for Children of Divorce

Children whose parents divorce, statistically speaking:

- **Academic performance**: Don't do as well academically and are less likely to go to college, partly because they don't have a parent to pay for it
- **Substance abuse**: Are 25% more likely to abuse drugs by age 14 (attributed to self-medication and lack of supervision)
- **Relationship patterns**: Are twice as likely to get divorced themselves
- **Abuse risk with step-parents**: If their parents find new partners, are **40 times more likely** than those who live with biological parents to be sexually or physically abused

These outcomes are not inevitable - they are associated with specific risk factors that can be avoided.

## The Six Risk Factors That Endanger Children

Avoiding these outcomes requires enormous maturity from both parents. The specific risk factors that harm children during divorce:

1. **Economic deterioration**: When the child's economic situation deteriorates
2. **Parental abandonment**: When one parent abandons the child or doesn't stay in close contact
3. **Ongoing conflict**: When parents keep fighting with each other
4. **Using the child as intermediary**: When parents say bad things about each other to their child, or use the child as a go-between
5. **Parental dysfunction**: When one or both parents "fall apart" and stop being responsible parents
6. **Lack of emotional support**: When the child does not have at least one warm, loving, accepting parent they can talk with and show their big emotions to
7. **Harsh step-parent**: When a new step-parent is harsh, rejecting, exploitive, or abusive

## Framework: Protecting Children Through Divorce

### Principle 1: Maintain the Co-Parenting Partnership

You may not be marital partners, but you will always be child-raising partners. This requires:

- Reaffirming to yourself every time you get mad at your ex that your child's emotional health is your mutual priority
- Modeling maturity in all interactions with your ex
- Continuously reaffirming this commitment to your ex through your behavior

### Principle 2: Eliminate Parental Conflict

Avoid fighting with your ex, even during divorce negotiations. The reasoning:

- Conflict between parents is one of the primary risk factors for poor child outcomes
- This requires great maturity from both parents
- Go to counseling together if necessary
- Frame this effort as being in the best interests of your child

**Specific tactic**: Avoid litigation, which creates a more adversarial relationship. Use mediation instead. Resolve financial issues quickly and move on.

### Principle 3: Both Parents Must Stay Involved

**It is in the best interests of the child for both parents to stay involved in the child's life.** This dramatically increases the chances that your child will grow up emotionally intact.

Options include:
- Shared custody
- Kids live with one parent but see the other parent very often

The key insight: "Would you be a great single parent? It's irrelevant." What damages children is feeling abandoned by the other parent. This happens frequently when fathers don't have much visitation time.

**Your job**: Nurture your child's relationship with their other parent:
- Be happy when they have fun with the other parent
- Don't make them feel guilty for loving their other parent
- Remember that your child did not get divorced - they are still related to, and need, both parents

## Handling Overnight Visitation

Overnight visitation is a stressor on all children. It is hard for any child to go back and forth from one home to another. All kids will need extra support during transitions.

**What matters most**: The child must be able to express distress about separation from the other parent and receive understanding from the parent they are with.

**The counterintuitive dynamic**: If the parent with the child expresses empathy for the child's distress about missing the other parent, it will actually strengthen the relationship with that parent. The relationship will begin to deepen so that the child feels close to both parents.

**What not to do**: Never distract the child from their upset about missing the other parent. This prevents the emotional processing they need.

## Announcing the Divorce to Children

### Before the Conversation

Make a plan with your ex before sitting down with children:
- Plan what you will tell the kids so there are clear answers to any questions
- As much as possible, plan to keep the child's life the same: home, bedroom, school, activities, friends
- This stability is important during a very hard time

### Give Maximum Warning Time

Adjusting to this new reality will be a challenge and will take time. Give as much time as possible for adjustment before big changes.

**Counterintuitive insight**: You may think giving early warning drags out the child's unhappiness, but having time to process will help your child adjust.

Specifics:
- If one parent will be moving out, tell your child as soon as you have both made a firm decision, even if it is months away
- If you are moving to a new home, tell your child as soon as you have a firm decision

### The Conversation Itself

**Do together**: Sit down together with the kids when telling them about the divorce.

**What to say**:
- Tell children you are not getting along and have decided to live apart
- Don't put blame on either partner
- Don't apologize for the decision
- Explain that you both did your best to save the marriage
- Say the decision to live apart was made by both people
- Say that even though there may be a tough transition, the divorce will give everyone a better life in the long run

**If child has seen fighting**: You can refer to that. Otherwise, just say you will be happier living apart, which will make you better parents.

**If child says you are destroying the family**: Stress that each of you is still in a family with your child, and that you will stay connected to each other as the child's parents.

### Critical Reassurances

1. **Not responsible**: Reassure kids they are not responsible for the separation

2. **Decision is final**: Emphasize that this is a decision you will not reconsider. The reasoning: Otherwise, your child will remain hopeful that you will "get back together." This prevents the child from moving into the necessary stage of grief. That stage is tough for them and for you, but it is essential for them to heal and get on with their lives.

3. **Love is unchanged**: Reassure kids that you both still love them very much and will both be there for them and be an active part of their lives.

4. **Stability commitments**: Commit to your kids that as much as possible will remain the same (home, room, school, activities, friends). Both parents will be there to support kids in their endeavors (shuttle them to sports games, see school performances).

5. **Control during chaos**: Especially if there will be big changes like a new home, work hard to identify some areas where things will NOT change, and where your child has some control of their life.

6. **Access to other parent**: Tell kids they can see the other parent whenever they want to. Make this easy for them. Give them cell phones so they can have a relationship with each parent that isn't mediated by the other.

## What Not to Do

### Never Ask Children to Choose

- Don't ask children who to live with
- Never ask kids to take sides, even subtly

### Never Make Promises You Can't Keep

You'll be tempted, but you'll end up regretting it.

### Never Use Children as Intermediaries

- Never say negative things about each other to the kids
- Never relay messages through your kids

**The reasoning**: Your child needs a positive relationship with both parents. If your ex is destroying that relationship, there is nothing you can do about that. But if you undermine that relationship with negative comments about your ex, you are hurting your child. You are also making your child angry at you. Even if your child can't tell you that, it will come out in their behavior.

### Never Talk About Each Other in Front of Kids

Never talk about each other in front of kids, even if they're across the room and you're on the phone with a friend. They will hear every word.

Never say anything in front of your kids, or on social media, that you don't want repeated to your ex.

### Maintain Appropriate Boundaries

Don't let your child "take care" of you. Don't share your financial worries. Never, ever, ever talk about your love life.

**The reasoning**: Your child needs you to be the stable, emotionally mature, resilient leader. You're at a point where you have to do the hard work of learning to be your own parent. That doesn't mean you have to do this alone - find other adults to support you.

## Supporting Children's Emotional Processing

### Let Them Express Big Emotions

Let your child rage, cry, and vent. This will feel like a death to them, and in fact it is: the death of their family.

Resist the urge to defend your decision. This is not about you, it is about them. They are entitled to their feelings.

### Show Up Consistently

Be aware that children need time with each parent more than ever during a divorce. Be there to spend time with them.

Make sure your child still feels connected to you when she is with the other parent by staying in touch via phone, Zoom, email, texting.

### Be Available for Repeated Conversations

Be there whenever your child needs to talk. Listen and reflect back what you hear: "Sounds like you're pretty mad at Mom and me that we're getting divorced."

Let your child have their feelings. Don't try to argue.

**Expect repetition**: You can expect to have to repeat this conversation over and over, in various forms, over time, as your child adjusts.

### Expect Displaced Emotions

This is a huge adjustment for your child. When they cry about the smallest thing, be aware that they are carrying around a backpack full of grief that needs to come out somehow.

**What not to do**: Don't make them feel analyzed by telling them they're really mad about the divorce.

**What to do**: Simply empathize: "You are so upset because you really want to do ____ and I won't let you... I'm sorry you can't do ____, Sweetie. We're having a really hard time these days."

## Creating a Positive Narrative

### Make a Book for Your Child

Start with when they were born, using family photos, emphasizing how much you both love them.

**Example narrative**: "Mom and Dad decided that they could not live in the same house any longer... So Dad moved to his new place on ____ Street (use photo of your son and dad happy in new place)... [Child's name] loved the ____ at the new place and loved playing ____ with Dad at the new place and making popcorn together... Sometimes he was sad and missed the old days... but he and mom still did ____ together every Friday night... and both mom and dad always celebrated his birthday."

**Key elements to include**:
- Any positive aspect of the new arrangement (puppy, goldfish, having two of a special toy - one for each house)
- Finish with how Mommy and Daddy are much happier now, and both love them so very much

### Consider Professional Support

Play therapy is a terrific way for kids to process big emotions and develop a positive way to understand what is happening.

**At-home therapeutic approaches**:
- Use stuffed animals to "act out" a family that is separating and sad
- Read books about divorce
- Tell stories about children whose parents got divorced, who felt sad, but both parents still loved them and everything worked out

## Maintaining Stability

### Keep Routines Consistent

As much as possible, maintain the same rules, the same bedtime, etc., at both homes. Observe the same family rituals your child is used to. Keep both parents involved for big occasions.

### Making Transitions Easier

**Use a set routine for transitions**. Consider doing the transition away from the home - at a park or playground. The reasoning:
- Reduces tension for all concerned
- Gives you a chance to play with your child and roughhouse a bit, to get them laughing
- Laughing reduces stress hormones and increases bonding hormones, which makes the transition easier

**Don't expect to shift into normal routine until you've reconnected with your child.**

**Practical tools**:
- Be sure the child has a certain stuffed animal to take back and forth
- Create a laminated list with photographs that stays in their backpack, helping them remember everything they need to bring back and forth
- Before you separate, talk about what you'll do when you're reunited, so they have something to look forward to

### Make Both Homes Feel Like Home

It is not a natural state for kids to go back and forth between two homes. Make it easy for them.

**What children need at each place**:
- Toiletries
- Clothes
- Shoes
- Their favorite foods
- A room they enjoy

Your child should never feel like a visitor at either house - they need to feel at home.

**Mindset shift**: Don't get crabby about the fact that your child leaves things at their "other" house and you need to buy replacements. It's not the child's fault they have to live in two places. The job of the adults is to make it easy for them.

## Handling New Relationships

### Your Ex's New Partner

If your ex has a new girlfriend or boyfriend, your job is to ensure that your ex still relates to your child.

Now that this new person is part of your child's life, your goal is to help your child have a positive relationship with that person as well.

**Warning**: Negativity toward the new partner will always be counter-productive and could drive your ex away from your child.

If your ex has another child, stress the positive sibling relationship.

### Your Own Dating

Put off dating for a while. If you do develop a relationship, don't be in a hurry to introduce your new partner to your child.

**The reasoning**: Your kids have already lost their family. They need time to get used to the idea of a step-parent. It won't help them to get close to a potential step-parent only to lose them.

### What Children Value

**Personal anecdote from the author**: "I still remember being in the fourth grade when a friend asked 'Who do you like better, your dad or your stepdad?' I answered 'My stepdad buys me lots of things, but my dad listens to me. I like being with him better.'"

**The lesson**: Children can't be bought. Focus on your relationship with your child, not on buying things to buy their love, or on what your ex can afford to buy and you can't.

## When One Parent Abandons the Child

Both parents are important. If a parent is loving, supportive, and positively engaged with the child, the effect will have positive ripples for the rest of that child's life. If that parent is harsh, the ripples will be negative.

If one parent leaves the child, whether by choice or by fate, there will be a loss that will stay with the child forever. As with all loss, the child is changed forever, and the emotional work is very real. But with enough love and support from you, your child can survive, and even thrive.

### What to Tell the Child

Tell your child that their dad (or mom) is having such a hard time that they can't get in touch with their love right now, even for their child.

**Key messages**:
- The parent leaving has NOTHING to do with the child
- Any parent would be lucky to have this child
- The parent is a mess right now, so their love is covered up
- The love for your child is there deep inside
- Maybe someday the parent will get their act together

Expect grief and acting out. Stay compassionate. Your love will pull your child through.

### Negative Presence vs. No Presence

**Research finding**: When a parent treats a child in a harsh or critical way, it is worse for the child than if that parental figure leaves, as long as the remaining parent is loving.

The child may grieve the loss of the parent, but that grief can heal with enough support from the remaining parent. In contrast, constant negativity is permanently disabling to the child.

---

## Taking the High Road

If one parent acts irresponsibly, the other may be tempted to do the same (by badmouthing them, for instance). This temptation should be resisted, as it is always bad for the kids.

**Example**: Even if you are the custodial parent and your spouse stops paying child support, don't share this info with your kids. It will make them feel even more abandoned and unloved.

---

## The Parent's Own Healing

If you recently divorced, you're probably grieving. You may not be able to imagine ever being happy again.

**Why your happiness matters**: Your child needs you to show them that life is worth living, even when we face setbacks.

**What not to do**: Don't swallow your pain and plaster on a fake smile. That won't fool your child and it won't help you.

**What to do**: Make nurturing yourself and healing yourself your highest priority. Sometimes crying is just what we need to reach a deeper understanding of what matters in life.

Make it your work in the next year to find ways to heal and move toward happiness. Your child deserves that from you. And you deserve that from life.

## Encouraging Research Finding

A 2014 study of a large number of children concluded: **Children living with one parent are as happy as those with two.**

This reinforces that the structure of the family matters less than the quality of parenting and the child's experience within that structure.
