# Catching Your Child Doing Something Right: Positive Attention as a Parenting Tool

## Core Principle

**What we pay attention to is what flourishes.** Every time you appreciate your child, every time you love something about them, you are giving them a clear message: "More of this, please." The child will grow accordingly.

This principle works because children, like all humans, grow and change when they feel loved, accepted, appreciated, and respected. Feeling accepted allows them to drop the need to defend themselves, which in turn makes them want to cooperate and allows them to learn and grow.

## The Problem with Criticism

### Where Critical Voice Comes From

The critical parenting voice comes from **fear**, not from frustration or annoyance (though those are what you feel in the moment). Specifically, it stems from fear that:
- Your child isn't growing up okay
- Your child won't turn out okay
- Either you or your child isn't good enough

This is your **inner critic** talking. The inner critic's job is to keep you on your toes, fending off any possible bad outcomes. However, happiness is not in its job description. And regardless of what your inner critic tells you, it isn't always right, either about the ultimate outcome or about what you should do right now.

### Why Criticism Fails

**Finding fault with kids doesn't help them change.** This shouldn't be surprising because criticism doesn't help adults change either. You could find negative things to say to your child all day long, and all of them would be "deserved," yet none of them would be effective in helping your child want to cooperate.

Examples of ineffective critical statements:
- "Aren't you ready yet?"
- "You'd lose your head if it wasn't on your shoulders"
- "How many times have I told you?"
- "Pick up your things"
- "Stop that right now"
- "You're wearing me out"
- "Don't start with me"
- "Leave your sister alone"
- "Are you listening to me?"
- "I said NOW!"
- "What part of No don't you understand?"

## The Reset Technique

When you open your mouth to criticize, take a deep breath and reassure yourself: **"He's acting like a kid because he IS a kid."** Then start over. Find a way to say what you need from your child, but with understanding or encouragement.

No matter what your child does, you have a choice about how you react. No parent is empathic all the time, but when we pay attention, we usually find we can eliminate much of the drama and upset in our homes just by managing our own emotions.

**Bonus effect:** When you reduce the frequency of getting upset, your child gives you the benefit of the doubt on those less frequent occasions when you do get upset.

## Four Strategies for Catching Children Doing Things Right

### 1. Notice All Progress in the Right Direction

Acknowledge progress even if it isn't perfect. Include things you think it's "about time" they did right.

**Example:** "Thanks for picking up your things with only one reminder! I really appreciate how you got up and did it."

This works because it reinforces the behavior you want to see more of, rather than holding out for perfection.

### 2. Be Specific Rather Than Evaluative

Instead of evaluating the child as a person ("You're a good girl!"), say very specifically what you appreciate.

**Example:** "I admire how you apologized to your friend. That took some courage."

The distinction matters because specific appreciation tells the child exactly what behavior to repeat, while general evaluation ("good girl") is vague and ties their worth to your approval rather than their actions.

### 3. Enjoy Your Child for Who They Are

Focus on appreciation rather than improvement suggestions.

**Good example:** "I loved watching you as 'Villager #3!'"

**Contrast with what to avoid:** "You should have spoken your one line louder so the whole audience could hear."

**Important role clarification:** Giving improvement feedback is the drama teacher's job, or the coach's job, or the classroom teacher's job. The parent's job is to keep the child's "love cup" filled so they can blossom.

### 4. Reframe Bothersome Traits as Strengths

Find a way to see your child positively by recognizing that things we see as bothersome are the flip side of a strength.

**Example:** Instead of complaining about hyperactivity, say "I love that you have so much energy!"

## Model Sound Track of Positive Attention

An example of what a day's worth of positive attention might sound like:

- "I love how cheerful you are in the morning. It makes me happy to wake up"
- "I noticed how nice you were to your sister last night"
- "I love it when you brush your teeth without being reminded"
- "I notice you're working so hard on that"
- "I know that's disappointing, but I see how you keep trying. Soon you'll get it every time"
- "Don't worry, Honey, nobody bats 1000"
- "Wow, you did so much better on your spelling test; all that practice is paying off!"
- "I loved watching you pass the ball"
- "Hey, you figured that out yourself!"
- "I love how you came home and started your homework right away!"
- "You're such a great hugger and snuggler"
- "I love our conversations in the car"
- "I really appreciate you controlling your temper so we could talk, that shows real maturity"
- "One of the many things I love about you is how you always give the dog lots of attention"
- "How did I get to be so lucky as to be YOUR mom?"

These examples demonstrate different categories of positive attention:
- Appreciating character traits ("cheerful in the morning," "great hugger")
- Noticing effort and persistence ("working so hard," "keep trying")
- Acknowledging improvement and growth ("did so much better," "shows real maturity")
- Expressing gratitude for cooperation ("without being reminded," "started homework right away")
- Celebrating independence ("figured that out yourself")
- Expressing unconditional love ("lucky to be your mom")

## Closing Insight

**Quote from Esther Hicks:** "If all you did was just look for things to appreciate you would live a joyous, spectacular life."

This reinforces that the practice of looking for things to appreciate benefits not just the child but transforms the parent's experience as well.
