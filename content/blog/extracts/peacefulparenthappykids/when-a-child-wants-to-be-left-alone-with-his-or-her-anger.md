# When a Child Wants to Be Left Alone with Their Anger

## Core Principle: Anger as a Secondary Emotion

**Anger is never the primary feeling.** It is always a response to deeper emotions that are either scary (like fear) or painful (like hurt). This is the foundational principle that explains why children behave the way they do when angry and why certain parental responses are more effective than others.

When a child is angry, what is actually happening beneath the surface is that these deeper, more vulnerable feelings are "bubbling up." The child does not want to experience those underlying emotions because they feel overwhelming or threatening. Anger serves as a protective shield that keeps the child from having to feel the fear or hurt underneath.

## Why Children Push Parents Away During Anger

When an angry child tells their parent "just go away," this is not a genuine desire for isolation. The child is trying to **stay angry** because anger feels safer than the vulnerable emotions underneath.

The mechanism works like this: if a parent stays present and offers compassion, the child's defensive anger will break down, and they will "burst into tears" and actually feel those painful or scary feelings they have been avoiding. The child instinctively knows this will happen and is trying to prevent it by pushing the parent away.

## The Danger of Leaving an Angry Child Alone

**What NOT to do:** Do not actually go away and leave the child alone with their anger.

**Why this approach fails:** If you leave the child alone when they demand it, they will "stop those feelings back down again." This creates two problems:

1. **Short-term consequence:** The suppressed feelings do not disappear. They will resurface at another time, meaning you are not resolving the emotional issue, just postponing it.

2. **Behavioral consequence:** In the meantime (while the feelings remain suppressed), the child becomes "more rigid and difficult." Unprocessed emotions manifest as behavioral problems and inflexibility.

The fundamental problem with leaving is that it enables emotional suppression rather than emotional processing.

## The Recommended Response

**Step 1: Acknowledge the child's request**
Say something like: "Okay, sweetie, I hear you telling me to go away."

This is important because it validates that you have heard what the child is communicating. You are not ignoring their words or dismissing their request.

**Step 2: Give physical but not emotional space**
"I'm going to step back a couple of steps."

You create some physical distance to honor part of what they asked for, without fully abandoning them.

**Step 3: Maintain presence and connection**
"But I'm not going to leave you alone with these big scary feelings. I'm right here when you need me."

This communicates several things simultaneously:
- You recognize that the feelings are big and scary
- You are committed to staying with them through this difficult moment
- You are available when they are ready, without forcing interaction

**Step 4: Assume a safe presence**
The parent should maintain what Dr. Markham calls "assuming presence" - a calm, safe presence that creates safety for the child to feel the feelings that are coming up for them.

## The Underlying Logic: Creating Safety for Emotional Processing

The entire approach is built on this premise: children need to **feel** their difficult emotions in order to process and move through them. They cannot do this if:
- They are alone (they will suppress instead of process)
- They feel unsafe (they will remain defended)

A parent's compassionate presence creates the safety needed for the child to let go of their defensive anger and actually feel the vulnerable emotions underneath. When those emotions are felt and processed with a supportive presence, the child can move through them rather than having them resurface later.

## Key Phrases to Use

- "I hear you telling me to go away"
- "I'm going to step back a couple of steps"
- "I'm not going to leave you alone with these big scary feelings"
- "I'm right here when you need me"

## What Makes This Approach Work

The parent acts as a **safe container** for the child's emotional experience. By staying present but not intrusive, the parent signals:
- I can handle your big emotions
- You are not alone
- It is safe to feel what you are feeling
- I will be here when you are ready to connect

This balance of giving physical space while maintaining emotional availability is what allows the child's defensive anger to eventually give way to the more vulnerable feelings that need to be processed.
