## Core Principle: The Bully Seeks a Reaction

**Every bully is looking for a reaction.** The fundamental dynamic behind bullying is the bully's desire for a feeling of power, which comes from successfully pushing another child's buttons. If the aggression gives the bully what they're looking for - that sense of power from upsetting the target - the aggression may well escalate.

This means the child's response to the initial unkind words can determine whether the bully continues to target this particular child. A calm, controlled reaction removes the reward the bully is seeking.

**The more your child can stay calm and control their reaction, the more likely the bully will stop their provocation.**

## Timing: Prevention Through Early Preparation

It is imperative to discuss this issue with every child BEFORE they might be subject to bullying. The reason for this timing is so they can stand up for themselves successfully when a bully first "tests" them. If the child already knows how to respond during that initial test, they can prevent escalation into repeated targeting.

## Teaching Method: Role-Playing as a Game

The best way to teach these strategies is to **make a game out of role-playing them**. The approach has multiple benefits:

1. **Get your child laughing** - this evaporates any tension about feeling vulnerable
2. **Let your child claim their power** - they practice standing up to you as the mock bully
3. **Create a subconscious model** - practicing creates a mental template, so your child is more likely to be able to access this attitude and these words when they're in a stressful situation

The key insight is that stress impairs recall and improvisation. By practicing responses beforehand, the child builds automatic access to effective responses even under pressure.

## Six Strategies for Responding to Bullying

### Strategy 1: Assert Yourself

**Physical presence matters.** Teach your child to face the bully by standing tall and using a strong voice.

**Name the behavior and demand it stop.** The child should identify what the bully is doing and explicitly tell them to stop:
- "That's teasing. Stop it."
- "Stop making fun of me. It's mean."

This approach works because it removes ambiguity - the child is clearly not a passive victim and is willing to confront the behavior directly.

### Strategy 2: Question the Response (Non-Defensive Questions)

**Ann Bishop**, who teaches violence prevention, recommends responding to an insult with a non-defensive question:
- "Why would you say that?"
- "Why would you want to tell me I am dumb (or fat) and hurt my feelings?"

This technique shifts the dynamic because it puts the bully on the spot to justify their behavior, rather than the target having to defend themselves. The question format avoids escalating into a fight while still confronting the behavior.

### Strategy 3: Use "I Want" Statements

Communication experts suggest teaching children to address the bully beginning with "I want" and firmly state what they want changed:
- "I want you to leave me alone."
- "I want you to stop teasing me."

The "I want" framing is powerful because it is direct, assertive, and clearly communicates the desired outcome without being aggressive or defensive.

### Strategy 4: Agree with the Teaser

This counterintuitive approach involves creating a statement that agrees with the teaser's insult, which defuses its power.

**Examples:**
- Teaser: "You're dumb." Child: "Yeah, but I'm good at it."
- Teaser: "Hey, four eyes." Child: "You're right, my eyesight is poor."

This strategy works because the bully expects the insult to hurt or provoke. When the target casually agrees, it removes the emotional reaction the bully was seeking and demonstrates that the insult has no power over the child.

### Strategy 5: Ignore It

**Bullies love it when their teasing upsets their victims.** The goal is to help your child find a way to not let their tormentor get to them.

**Kid-tested ways to ignore teasers** (from fifth graders):
- "Pretend they're invisible"
- "Walk away without looking at them"
- "Quickly look at something else and laugh"
- "Look completely uninterested"

The key is appearing genuinely unaffected. If the bully cannot get a reaction, they lose interest because the interaction isn't giving them what they want.

### Strategy 6: Make Fun of the Teasing (Rehearsed Comebacks)

**Fred Frankel**, author of *Good Friends Are Hard to Find*, suggests victims answer every tease with a reply, but not tease back.

**Important distinction:** The child responds but does not counter-attack. This is crucial because teasing back escalates the conflict, while a dismissive response does not.

**Rehearsed comeback examples:**
- "Really?"
- "So?"
- "You don't say"
- "And your point is?"
- "Thanks for telling me"

**Example scenario:** The teaser says, "You're stupid." The child responds with one of the rehearsed comebacks.

**Why this works:** The teasing often stops because the child lets the tormentor know they're not going to let the teasing get to them (even if it does internally). The bully realizes they cannot get the desired reaction and moves on.

## Using These Skills to Defend Others

These strategies can also help children stick up for others when they see another child being targeted. The same principles apply - calm responses, not giving the bully the reaction they want, and direct confrontation of the behavior.
