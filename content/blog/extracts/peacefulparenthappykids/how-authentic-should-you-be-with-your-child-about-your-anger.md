## Core Principle: Emotional Honesty Starts With Yourself, Not Your Child

The fundamental insight is that **emotional honesty** in parenting means being honest with yourself about your feelings, not dumping those feelings onto your child. Every parent experiences rage toward their child at times. Stuffing those feelings down doesn't help anyone. But expressing them directly to your child isn't being authentically grown-up - it's behaving like a child having a tantrum. When children model this behavior back, we call it a tantrum. The same standard applies to us.

The recommendation is to **avoid relating to your child when you are angry**, unless there's immediate danger requiring you to remove the child from harm's way. This isn't dishonesty or inauthenticity - it's emotional maturity and responsibility.

## Why Expressing Anger Doesn't Work

### Anger Escalates Rather Than Resolves

When you want someone to be motivated to work things out with you, you need to create **safety**. Blasting them with your anger does the opposite - it escalates drama and makes the other person more reactive. This makes productive resolution nearly impossible. You cannot coach your child with respect and compassion when you perceive them as the enemy.

### Valid Anger Doesn't Grant Permission to Express It

You are always entitled to all of your emotions. But just because your anger is valid doesn't give you the right to visit that anger on another person. **Anger is a message and a signal**, not a directive to act. It signals that you are triggered by the situation and that you have more vulnerable, scary emotions underneath - fear, sadness, hurt. Anger is the protective response to feeling threatened, whether by an actual external threat or by those upsetting internal emotions.

### Expressing Anger Reinforces the Emergency Response

Contrary to popular belief, expressing anger to someone else doesn't release it healthily. Instead, it **reinforces the internal feeling that it's an emergency**. This heightens your fight-or-flight response, which makes the other person look like the enemy.

What is actually healthy is to:
1. Take a deep breath
2. Remind yourself it isn't an emergency
3. Give yourself compassion and understanding for being so upset
4. Allow yourself to feel the tears and fears beneath the anger
5. Remind yourself that you want to act in a mature, loving, and compassionate way

## The Distinction: Your Feelings vs. Your Child's Responsibility

### Feelings Belong to the Person Having Them

A critical reframe: **Your feelings are not caused by your child - they are caused by your own conclusions** about what happened. When you think "She lied to me... How dare she?!... She's going to be an immoral person!" those thoughts generate the feelings. We can't always choose our feelings, but we are always responsible for what we do with them. This is exactly what we try to teach our children when they get furious at a sibling or someone else.

### The Vulnerable Emotions Under Anger

Being completely honest with yourself about your feelings means acknowledging what's really happening beneath the anger. Instead of acting on the sense of emergency and "being honest" by speaking or acting angrily, true honesty means recognizing these underlying emotions:

- "It scares me that she would lie to me."
- "How can I trust him after this?"
- "I'm afraid that she'll come to a bad end."
- "Am I raising ungrateful brats?!"
- "I feel powerless to get her to tell me the truth."
- "I don't know how to get through to him."
- "It hurts so much when she says such nasty things to me, after all my sacrifices for her."
- "Have I been such a terrible parent, for him to act this way?"
- "I feel so helpless!"

These are feelings - **they are not necessarily the truth of the matter at all**. Feelings are signals of internal work you need to do. They are not always indicators of situational truth, and they certainly are not always best handled by sharing them unfiltered with the other person. Your responsibility to your child is to create safety and coach them to be their best self, not to "express yourself."

## How Anger Works and What to Do With It

### Anger as Defense Mechanism

Anger always signals that something needs changing, but often the change has to start inside yourself. **Anger protects you by fending off your own more vulnerable emotions**. Without consciousness and awareness, you attack instead of acknowledging your hurt, fear, grief, and powerlessness.

### The Process of Working Through Anger

When you breathe your way through those more vulnerable emotions, you receive the message the feelings are sending: You care so much it hurts. You're afraid you've messed up. You're afraid you've damaged your child. As you feel these emotions, they begin to evaporate. You no longer need the anger as a defense. The anger starts to melt away.

**Only after the anger has faded** and you see your own contribution to the problem do you feel empowered to take constructive action. This is why **"Stop, Drop, and Breathe"** is recommended as the most effective parenting mantra - it stops you from taking action when you're triggered.

### Diagnostic Use of Anger

Use anger diagnostically rather than acting it out on someone else. Ask yourself:

- What is making me so upset?
- Am I hurt? Afraid? Feeling powerless?
- What can I do to take better care of me?
- How can I address the actual source of these more vulnerable emotions in a constructive way?
- Are my expectations of my child reasonable?
- If so, what support does my child need to be able to meet those expectations?

## Authentic Communication That Actually Works

### Going Under the Anger to Fear

Being authentic and honest means being more vulnerable by going under the anger to the fear beneath. The contrast:

**Inauthentic (staying at anger level):** "I'm angry that you lied to me."

**Authentic (revealing vulnerability beneath):** "I'm scared that you lied to me... I'm afraid that means that you don't think you can tell me the truth... You are so important to me and I'm terrified that I'm losing you."

### When and How to Share Feelings

Later, when everyone has calmed down, share your feelings and tell your child what you need from them in the future. For example: "When you lie to me like you did, I feel hurt and scared. I need to be able to trust what you say."

Most children who have experienced empathy and apologies from their parents will respond with a heartfelt apology. Since you're creating safety by empathizing, they'll tell you why they made such a poor choice. Then you can explore with them how to handle a similar situation better next time.

This approach helps your child learn the lesson you want to teach far more effectively than throwing a tantrum and dumping your anger and fear on them.

## The Gandhi Reframe for Seeing Beyond Your Perspective

You're only human, so you only get to see from where you're standing. If you could see things from your child's perspective, the same circumstances would look very different. You'll always get closer to authentic, honest communication if you reframe the situation for a larger view.

**The Gandhi Example:** When Gandhi's grandson reportedly lied to him, Gandhi asked himself: "What about me wasn't safe enough for him to trust me with the truth?"

Asking this question dissolves anger and enables more effective problem-solving.

## Why Shaming Doesn't Work

### Telling Kids You're Disappointed Is Shaming

Telling your child you're disappointed, sad, or angry about their behavior to "get them to act right" is shaming. You can certainly tell your child what you need and expect from them (like honesty), but your feelings are your own responsibility.

### What Actually Creates Good Behavior

All children act like children. All children experiment with breaking rules, lying, and other unacceptable behavior. Kids who adore and respect you don't want to disappoint you, so they're more likely to follow your rules.

**You don't get that relationship by making a child feel guilty and ashamed** (which is what happens when you say "I'm sad, angry, and disappointed in you").

You get that relationship by:
- Coaching your child through their emotions so they can better manage their behavior
- Setting clear, kind limits about acceptable behavior
- Giving your child the support they need to manage themselves better
- Role-modeling respectful expression of emotions, so your child respects you

### The Coach Analogy

Kids want to act right. If they don't, something's getting in their way and they need coaching. **A coach doesn't say to a player "I'm sad, angry, and disappointed about your playing."** The coach takes responsibility for coaching himself through his own feelings. Then he figures out how to help the player do better.

Real honesty means taking responsibility for your own feelings rather than dumping them on someone else.

## Common Objections and Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I need to show them how angry I am" | This depends on your desired outcome. If you want them motivated to work things out, you need safety, not anger. |
| "I'm entitled to be angry" | You're entitled to feel it, but not to dump it on another person. |
| "It's healthy to express anger" | Expressing it reinforces the emergency feeling and fight-or-flight response. |
| "My child made me mad" | Those are your feelings, caused by your conclusions, not by your child. |
| "I want to be honest about my feelings" | Real honesty means being honest with yourself about the vulnerable feelings under the anger. |
| "My anger tells me to do something" | Yes - often the change needs to start inside yourself, not as external action against another person. |
| "Am I letting them get away with it?" | No. After anger fades, you'll have clarity to set clear, kind limits and coach them through their emotions - for their development, not because you're mad. |

## Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Dumping upsets on children in the name of honesty** - This isn't acting like a grown-up; it's modeling tantrum behavior.

2. **Believing expressing anger is healthy** - It actually reinforces the emergency response and escalates conflict.

3. **Believing your child caused your feelings** - Your feelings come from your conclusions about events, not the events themselves.

4. **Sharing unfiltered emotions as "authenticity"** - True authenticity involves the vulnerability beneath anger, not the anger itself.

5. **Using disappointment, sadness, or anger to motivate good behavior** - This is shaming and damages the relationship that actually produces good behavior.

6. **Taking action while triggered** - The "Stop, Drop, and Breathe" mantra exists specifically to prevent this.

7. **Assuming you see the whole truth** - You see from where you're standing; your child's perspective would look very different.
