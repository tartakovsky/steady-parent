## Core Understanding: Why Children Use Social Exclusion Language

**"You're not my friend" is completely normal preschool behavior.** Any preschool teacher will confirm this. Children ages 4-5 use phrases like "You're not my friend" and "I hate you" as code for a wide range of feelings and intentions:

- "I'm tired of playing with you now"
- "I want my way!"
- Power plays similar to toddlers using "no"

The phrase "If you don't do what I want, then you can't come to my birthday party!" falls into the same category of standard preschool power plays.

**However, this behavior requires active intervention.** While normal, the child is doing more than expressing anger - she is using the **threat of complete disengagement**. This is the "nuclear option" in social negotiations. Although kids are by nature forgiving, these threats may indeed drive other kids away over time. The preschool years are the perfect developmental window to teach more appropriate negotiating skills before this pattern becomes entrenched.

## The 12-Step Framework for Teaching Social Skills

### Step 1: Provide Opportunities for Appropriate Power

**Make sure your child gets plenty of opportunities to make her own choices and feel powerful in her life.**

The reasoning: Much like toddlers who revel in the power of saying "no," preschoolers abuse the power of social exclusion more when that is the only time they get to feel powerful. When children have appropriate outlets for autonomy and control, they have less need to weaponize social relationships.

### Step 2: Avoid Modeling Threats, Power Plays, and Social Exclusion

**Don't use discipline strategies that make use of threats, power plays (punishment of any sort), or social exclusion (timeouts).**

The reasoning: You don't want to model the exact behaviors you're trying to eliminate. Children learn from what parents do, not just what they say.

**What to do instead:** Set appropriate limits, with empathy. Kids whose parents use empathic limits as their primary parenting tool are receiving constant training in empathy. This makes them much less likely to be mean to others because they've internalized the empathic approach.

### Step 3: Actively Sensitize Your Child to Others' Experiences

**Comment on how others feel so your child sees things from other people's viewpoints.**

Examples of what to say:
- "Look, that boy is crying. I wonder why?"
- "Jenna seemed so happy when you hugged her."

Why this matters: It's crucial that children develop this skill for two reasons:
1. So they become kind people (which all parents want)
2. **Reading social cues is the only way to function in a complicated social world** - this is a practical survival skill, not just a moral one

### Step 4: Have Discussions About Anger When Your Child Isn't Angry

**Talk to your daughter when she isn't angry about how it feels when she is mad.**

The discussion should include:
- Agree with her that when we're mad it's hard not to say angry things
- Acknowledge that you know she is mad when she says these things
- Validate that it must seem true to her at the time
- Ask her if, in retrospect, she actually meant what she said
- Ask her how she thinks her words made her friend feel
- Explore how else she might have handled that situation

The timing is critical because children cannot process this information or engage in reflective thinking while they are emotionally activated.

### Step 5: Process Incidents After the Fact by Finding Underlying Emotions

**If your daughter tells you about one of these incidents later, let her blow off steam by talking about it.**

The technique:
- Reflect what she's saying so she feels heard and understood
- If your daughter insists that she meant what she said, remember that **anger is always a response to underlying hurt, fear or sadness**
- Look for those underlying feelings
- Validate them
- Help your daughter acknowledge them

Example of how to verbalize this: "Sounds like you were hurt when Cassie wanted to let the other kids join your game, because you wanted to play with just the two of you... You were sad inside... You felt hurt, so you wanted to hurt Cassie back. So you said angry things to her."

This framing helps the child understand the causal chain: underlying hurt -> anger -> hurtful words.

### Step 6: Help Find Words That Express Real Feelings

**Help your daughter find words that actually express her real feelings that she could say next time.**

Example: Instead of "You're not my friend," she could say: "Cassie, I love playing our game with just US right now. I like the other kids too, but maybe we can play with them later?"

The principle: Replace the nuclear option (social exclusion threats) with direct expression of actual wants and needs.

### Step 7: Help Reinterpret Others' Behavior When Your Child Over-Reacts

**When your child is over-reacting to another child's behavior, help her see it differently.**

Example: "Cassie likes you a lot. She also likes to play with the other kids with you because that's fun too. She always likes you, whether or not other kids are around."

This addresses the cognitive distortion that often underlies explosive reactions - the child may be catastrophizing or misreading the situation.

### Step 8: Prepare Before Play Dates

**Talk to your daughter before her play dates about what might happen and how she could respond if she gets hurt, sad, or angry.**

Key messages to convey:
- All her feelings are fine and can be expressed directly
- She never has to attack another person to express her own wants and needs
- We all have a responsibility to be considerate of others

Help her practice more direct ways of expressing needs:
- "I'm sorry, I don't feel like sharing right now; Can I give this to you when I'm done?"
- "I'm scared about climbing high like you do. Can we play over here instead?"

### Step 9: Teach Anger and Frustration Management Skills

**Teach your daughter practical skills to manage her anger and frustration.**

Specific techniques to teach:
- Carry a squeezy ball in her pocket to squeeze
- Close her eyes, breathe, and count to ten
- Use self-talk: "I am really mad and I don't want to say anything mean so I am going to get a drink of water and calm down"

These are physical and verbal strategies that create space between the emotional trigger and the response.

### Step 10: Teach Negotiation and Problem-Solving

**Teach your daughter to negotiate disagreements with her friends.**

Introduce the core problem-solving concept: **"We can find a solution that works for everyone."**

Example scenario: "Cassie wants to play dress-up. Jade wants to play dolls. What could you both enjoy doing?"

Possible outcomes:
- They may decide to play house, which could involve both dress-up and dolls
- They may go outside to the swings
- Either way, **no one loses**

The key principle is that solutions exist where both parties get their needs met, rather than one winning and one losing.

### Step 11: Intervene When You Overhear Mean Remarks

**When kids say mean things to each other and adults don't step in, research shows that children take that as tacit approval.**

This contradicts the common adult assumption that when kids fight, we should let them learn by working it out for themselves. The research says otherwise.

**What to do instead:** Take angry words as a signal that your daughter and her friend need parental coaching to:
- Help them resolve the immediate conflict
- Learn skills for future conflicts

## Detailed Intervention Script for Mean Remarks

### Phase 1: Acknowledge the Anger Without Judgment

In a very calm, warm voice, say something like: "Those words could really hurt. It sounds like you are so angry at Cassie right now that maybe you want to hurt her. When you get angry like that, I know you must be sad or hurt inside. Let's work out what's upsetting you."

Then address the other child: "I know it hurts to have my daughter speak so angrily to you. I'm so sorry."

### Phase 2: Facilitate Understanding

Sit down with both children, preferably with an arm around each of them, and say: "I wonder if you both could tell me what's happening? Maybe I can help."

**Don't take sides.** Instead, listen to each child so they feel heard.

### Phase 3: Reflect Each Child's Perspective

Listen respectfully as each tells her side of the story, and reflect her point of view.

Example: "So you wanted to play the game with the rules on the box." (Turning to the other girl) "And you wanted to play the game the way you learned it at school."

Why this works:
- It allows each child to feel heard
- It helps each child understand the other child's perspective
- It is particularly important to acknowledge the hurtfulness of the mean comments so the playmate can let go of her anger and participate in problem-solving

At this point, having had their anger and hurt acknowledged, they will hopefully be a little calmer.

### Phase 4: Frame the Problem as a Challenge

Acknowledge that it's a difficult problem: "Wow. This is a big challenge. The same game, but two different sets of rules. And each girl wants to do it the way she's used to. That IS hard to work out. Any ideas about what you could do?"

### Phase 5: Facilitate Solution Generation

As they chime in about possible solutions, acknowledge each girl's suggestions by repeating them, **without judgment**.

Example: "Cassie thinks you should just make one change in the rules. But Jade doesn't want to change the rules and just wants to play a different game. Hmmm. I wonder how you two can find a solution that works for everyone?"

This last sentence puts the responsibility to find a win/win solution on them.

**Critical warning: Don't issue an edict on what they should do.** Two reasons:
1. One or both of them will resent it
2. You rob them of the opportunity to learn they can reach a negotiated settlement

### Phase 6: Offer Subtle Guidance If Needed

If they can't seem to come up with a solution after a while, and you can do it subtly, you can ask a question like: "What would happen if you played the game Cassie's way for awhile and then played the game your way for awhile?"

### Phase 7: Build Toward Independence

With practice, you'll eventually be able to say: "I have confidence you two can find a solution that works for both of you so you can start playing again. I can't wait to hear what it is!"

At this stage, you'll be able to actually go start dinner or something (but stay within earshot).

### Phase 8: Celebrate the Solution

Once they announce a solution, say in a celebratory tone: "You two are such great problem-solvers - you came up with a solution that works for both of you! What good friends you are! No more upset feelings? Why don't you two hug and make up, so you have time to play more?"

### Why Forced Apologies Usually Aren't Necessary

Usually there is no need to urge anyone to apologize because:
- Both kids participated in the fight
- Making someone apologize makes them defensive

Kids do seem to get over these hurtful comments quickly if you help them find a solution to the disagreement that triggered it in the first place.

**Exception:** If the other child still seems angry or hurt, you can say to your daughter: "Cassie still feels sad because of what you said to her. Can you tell her how much you want to be her friend and play together now?" Usually your daughter will be more than happy to oblige now that the conflict is behind her.

## Handling Judgmental Friends or Family

### The Recommended Approach

**Start by agreeing** that this kind of comment is hurtful and it bothers you to have your daughter be hurtful to others.

**If you can do it humorously and without being defensive,** you might add that you've been told it's normal behavior for kids this age and hopefully doesn't portend that your daughter will be an axe murderer or pariah.

**Request that they not escalate:** As much as you love and appreciate their concern for your daughter, you'd actually prefer that they not make a big deal with your daughter about it. The reason: when your daughter feels a need to defend her position, she may get stuck on it.

**Reassure them by describing your intervention plan** - your own "12-Step program" for addressing the behavior.

**If they seem unconvinced,** you might ask them what they recommend that you do about it. This invites collaboration rather than creating defensiveness.

## Why Timeouts Are Counterproductive for This Behavior

Many parents do tell their kids that mean language like this is on a par with name calling and is simply not permissible, punishable by a timeout.

**The logical problem:** Teaching kids not to use the power of social exclusion against each other by threatening them with social exclusion in the form of a timeout is just as likely to backfire as teaching them not to hit by hitting them.

**The alternative:** Intervene by teaching social skills, so your daughter has some options besides going nuclear.

## Key Principles Summary

1. The behavior is normal but still requires active intervention
2. Children who feel powerful in appropriate ways don't need to weaponize social relationships
3. Don't model what you're trying to eliminate (threats, power plays, social exclusion)
4. Anger is always a response to underlying hurt, fear or sadness
5. The goal is replacing the "nuclear option" with direct expression of needs
6. Adult non-intervention is interpreted as approval of mean behavior
7. Facilitate solutions rather than imposing them
8. Forced apologies create defensiveness
9. Using social exclusion (timeout) to punish social exclusion is logically contradictory
