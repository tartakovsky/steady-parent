# Discipline for Defiant, Spirited Toddler

## Summary

This Q&A article by Dr. Laura Markham addresses a parent's concerns about disciplining a 26-month-old who exhibits defiant behaviors: going floppy when corrected, running away with forbidden objects, and deliberately doing things she's asked not to do. Dr. Markham explains these are developmentally normal behaviors stemming from a toddler's need for power, autonomy, and experimentation. The key insight is that punishment doesn't help toddlers learn - instead, parents should set calm limits while attending to the child's underlying emotions, maintain connection, and use play to meet the child's need for power in appropriate ways.

## Main Concepts

### Responsive Parenting Evolution
- Responsive parenting with infants means giving them what they want/need
- With toddlers, wants and needs diverge - parents must think about short-term and long-term needs
- Parents listen to what the child wants, consider everyone's needs, make decisions for the child's highest good, then respond to the child's emotional reaction to limits

### Why Toddlers Don't Need Punishment
- 26-month-olds are working hard to figure out rules
- Punishment doesn't help them learn at any age
- They need constant, patient guidance about appropriate behavior
- Anger from parents scares children and triggers "fight, flight, freeze" - making learning impossible
- Patiently setting limits while empathizing with unhappiness is more effective for teaching

### Understanding Toddler Defiance
- Toddlers experiment with power and independence
- They often do what they're asked not to do - this isn't personal
- They want to be in charge of their own lives (a healthy impulse)
- Defiance signals the child needs more connection with the parent
- When children feel overly controlled or pushed around, they resist more

## Detailed Insights

### The "Floppy" Response (Fight, Flight, Freeze)
**Problem:** Child goes droopy-eyed and floppy when stopped from doing something

**Why it happens:**
- Child may be in "freeze" mode - a natural response to being frightened
- A giant (parent) grabbing them roughly can feel scary
- Even if not frightened, may be avoiding another lecture
- May feel embarrassed/humiliated about being caught doing something off-limits
- May have been acting out to get help with big feelings

**Solutions:**
- Take a deep breath before intervening - "There's no emergency"
- Move in close and scoop calmly rather than grabbing roughly
- Don't lecture - the floppy child isn't learning
- Attend to underlying emotions instead
- Look child in eye, state simple limit, then hold and acknowledge feelings
- Use phrases like "You don't like it when I stop you... I'm right here... You're safe"

### Running Away with Forbidden Objects
**Problem:** Child grabs things she shouldn't and runs away, both having fun and knowing it's wrong

**Why it happens:**
- Another way of exercising power
- Testing to see if she can outrun/outmaneuver parent

**Solutions:**
- Play chase games daily (unrelated to misbehavior) to meet this need appropriately
- When child grabs something forbidden: stop chasing so she stops running
- Say calmly: "You have the [object]. Can you show me?"
- When she brings it back, resist snatching - show her how to use it safely instead
- Give her mastery (a higher form of power than running away with forbidden items)
- Persistent defiance signals need for more connection - prioritize roughhousing, snuggling, sharing her interests

### Doing What Parent Says NOT to Do
**Problem:** Child deliberately does the opposite of requests, including swallowing things when asked to take them out of her mouth

**Why it happens:**
- Child is proving she CAN do what she wants (which is true)
- Need for power and autonomy isn't being met

**Solutions:**
- Use play to address this: "Reverse psychology" game called "NO, DON'T DO THAT!"
- Make it jokey and fun: "Don't drink that juice... Oh no, she's drinking it!"
- End with connection: "When you do what I tell you not to, you must need a huge snuggle!"
- This defuses the need to oppose and tension between parent and child
- When not playing the game, serious limits are communicated through tone and body language
- 80% of communication is tone and body language - child will know the difference
- Increase child's sense of mastery and control in other areas to reduce testing behavior

## Key Quotes

> "26 month olds are working hard to figure out the rules. They never need discipline (in the sense of punishment) at this age or any age, because it does not help them learn."

> "Anger always scares our child, and kids can't learn when they're in 'fight, flight, freeze.' Patiently setting the limit and empathizing with our child's unhappiness is always more effective in teaching."

> "Eventually, our child learns that she doesn't always get what she wants, but she gets something better: someone who loves and accepts her, no matter what, including all of her angry and unhappy feelings."

> "All children want to just do what they want. But more than that, they want to stay positively connected with you. Defiance is saying she no longer cares about the connection."

## Practical Applications

### When Setting Limits
1. Take a breath first - "There's no emergency"
2. Intervene calmly and physically only as much as necessary
3. State the limit simply: "That's not for throwing" or "The dog doesn't like that. It hurts him."
4. Acknowledge child's perspective: "You WANT to throw right now"
5. Offer an alternative: "We can throw a ball outside"
6. Hold and comfort if child cries - this helps process big feelings

### Sample Scripts
- "That's not for throwing. We can throw a ball outside."
- "The dog doesn't like that. It hurts him. OUCH!"
- "You don't like it when I stop you... You like to throw things... I'm right here... You're safe."
- "You WANT to play with the dog, don't you, Sweetie? Here's how: GENTLE, GENTLE."
- "This is not a game. We don't hurt the dog."

### Building Connection to Reduce Defiance
- Lots of roughhousing and laughing
- Plenty of snuggling
- Share her interests
- Daily chase games (builds her sense of power appropriately)
- "Reverse psychology" games for giggles
- When in doubt, default to more snuggles

## Age Relevance
