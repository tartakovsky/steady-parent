# Cherishing: The Foundation of Emotional Development

## Core Concept: Cherishment as Soul Food

**Cherishment** is the emotional equivalent of nourishment - "soul food" for psychological development. The term was coined by psychotherapists Elisabeth Young-Bruehl and Faith Bethelard. Just as physical nourishment is required for bodily growth, cherishment is required for healthy emotional and relational development.

Humans are born ready to love and to be loved. Babies arrive with an expectation and need to be cherished. This is not a luxury or nice-to-have - it is a survival need that shapes the entire trajectory of emotional development.

## Why Cherishment Matters: The Developmental Mechanism

### Identity Formation Through Cherishment

The cherishing of an infant - the affirmation of the baby from head to toe - is how the baby learns who they are. This happens through interaction with parents in two parallel tracks:

**Physical Self-Discovery**: Through loving physical interaction (bathing, feeding, playing), babies learn about their bodies. When Dad kisses the baby's toes, the baby learns "Yes, these are my toes, how good they feel!" This embodied experience of being loved teaches the baby to inhabit and accept their physical self.

**Relational Self-Discovery**: Through emotional mirroring and reciprocal interaction, babies learn about their effect on others and their inherent value. When Mom makes a happy sound in response to the baby's smile, the baby learns "I can bring joy to others. My presence matters."

**Core Worth Belief**: The cumulative effect teaches the fundamental belief: "Mom and Dad love to bathe me, to feed me, to care for me: I am worth taking care of. I am lovable." This belief becomes the foundation of self-esteem.

### Cherishment as Foundation for Key Capacities

Being cherished as a baby is the foundation for developing:
- **Empathy** - the ability to feel what others feel
- **Compassion** - the motivation to respond to others' suffering
- **Emotional generosity** - the capacity to give love freely without keeping score

These capacities cannot be taught didactically - they emerge from the experience of being cherished.

### The Security-Exploration Connection

The expectation of unconditional love creates a security base that paradoxically enables risk-taking. The child who knows someone adoring is watching out for them and supporting their growth can afford to:
- Risk bumps and scrapes
- Experience disappointment
- Face heartbreak

This security is what allows children to learn so quickly. Without the certainty of a loving safety net, children become cautious and learning slows.

## What Cherishing Looks Like for the Parent

**To cherish is to revel in being this baby's parent** - to feel grateful even during the difficult parts (diapers, sleeplessness, colic) that this particular baby was sent to these particular arms.

This is not about performing love or going through the motions of care. It is about an internal state of delight, gratitude, and reverence for the child.

## Barriers to Cherishing: The Intergenerational Pattern

### When Parents Haven't Been Cherished Themselves

If parents have not been cherished in their own childhood, cherishing can be challenging. Specific manifestations include:

**Annoyance Instead of Delight**: The baby's need for attention triggers irritation rather than the natural parental response of delighted engagement. The parent may feel burdened by what should feel fulfilling.

**Anger Instead of Sympathy**: When the baby cries or howls, instead of feeling sympathetic concern, the parent feels angry. The baby's distress is experienced as an imposition rather than a call for care.

**Discomfort with Adoration**: The baby's adoring gaze feels uncomfortable to receive. The parent may avoid prolonged eye contact. This discomfort often operates below conscious awareness.

**Interrupting Reciprocal Play**: Parents may cut short the natural back-and-forth play that builds attachment without noticing they are doing it or recognizing their underlying discomfort. The pattern is often invisible to the parent themselves.

**Envy of Attention**: Parents who weren't cherished may feel jealous of the attention their baby receives from others, rather than feeling proud and pleased.

**Demanding Premature Adaptation**: These parents may insist the baby adapt to adult needs inappropriately. Example given: refusing to baby-proof adequately and then becoming angry when the baby repeatedly explores forbidden areas like the dog's water bowl. This represents a failure to understand normal infant development and an unrealistic expectation that the baby should override their instincts to accommodate the parent.

## Consequences of Insufficient Cherishment

### For the Child: The Mechanics of Emotional Damage

**The Need Doesn't Disappear**: The need for cherishing, like all survival needs, doesn't vanish when thwarted. It goes underground. The child defends against this dangerous need (dangerous because it makes them vulnerable) by warding it off with anger. Over time, this defensive anger hardens into bitterness.

**Self-Rejection**: When parts of the child are not accepted by the parent (for example, a parent who can handle neediness but not anger), the child rejects those parts of themselves. The unaccepted aspects become shadowed with shame. The child's ability to love themselves is compromised because they are not good enough to evoke what they need most.

**Compromised Emotional Growth**: As the child rejects parts of themselves, their emotional development is stunted. They cannot integrate all parts of their experience into a whole self.

**The Expectation of Rejection**: In extreme cases, hope of being loved becomes too painful. The child protects their broken heart by consciously expecting rejection. Some children become experts at soliciting dislike - they provoke the rejection they expect because anticipated pain is more bearable than hope repeatedly dashed.

**The Extreme Outcome**: In the most extreme cases, children deprived of love can become capable of intentionally hurting others. As researcher Rene Spitz stated: "Infants without love...will end as adults full of hate." The capacity for love, when starved, can invert into a capacity for cruelty.

### The Universal Hunger

Most people receive enough cherishment to avoid extreme outcomes, but few receive enough to have full emotional generosity as their automatic response. Bruce Springsteen's observation - "Everybody's got a hungry heart" - captures the near-universal experience of not quite enough cherishment.

This hungry heart - these unmet needs - are what drive all "bad behavior" in children. While children sometimes simply want what they want, and all children have moments of being overwhelmed by emotion or struggling to regulate behavior, the underlying driver of persistent behavioral problems is the hunger for cherishment.

## The Contrast: Well-Cherished Children

Children who feel unconditionally loved and accepted show distinct patterns:

**Fewer "Bad" Feelings Driving Behavior**: The emotional fuel tank is fuller, so there's less acting out from emotional deprivation.

**Earlier Self-Regulation**: Their brains develop the capacity to regulate behavior and emotion earlier than under-cherished peers.

**Prioritizing the Relationship**: They value the relationship with their parent, which makes them more open to parental influence. They WANT to cooperate because the relationship matters to them.

**Positive Self-Concept**: They see themselves as having value and being able to make a positive contribution to the world.

**Better Outcomes**: They are happier, more cooperative, more responsible, and more emotionally generous.

## Conditional Acceptance vs. Unconditional Love

Most parents try to cherish their children, but everyone carries their own emotional scar tissue from childhood. This creates limits on the ability to cherish. The result is often conditional acceptance rather than unconditional love.

Example of conditional acceptance: A parent might be comfortable when the child is needy (and respond with love and patience) but find it difficult to handle the child when they're angry (responding with rejection or punishment). The child learns that some parts of themselves are acceptable and others are not.

## Key Framework: Cherishment as Prevention

The article positions cherishment as preventive medicine for emotional and behavioral problems. Rather than focusing on correcting "bad behavior" after it occurs, cherishment addresses the underlying cause - the hungry heart seeking the love it needs.

## Practical Implications

**This is Hard Work**: Unconditional love is described as "some of the hardest work anyone ever does." If it feels like too big a lift, that's a signal that you need more support, not that you're failing.

**Support is Essential**: Parents don't need to do this alone. The difficulty of cherishing - especially when one wasn't cherished oneself - is a call for support, not judgment.

**Instinct is a Guide**: Cherishing babies is natural if we listen to our instincts. The challenge is that unresolved emotional wounds can block access to these instincts.

## Summary of Causal Chain

1. Baby is born with expectation and need for cherishment
2. Parent either provides cherishment (based partly on their own childhood experience) or struggles to provide it
3. If cherished: Baby develops secure sense of self, capacity for empathy and emotional generosity, ability to take healthy risks
4. If not cherished: Baby rejects unaccepted parts of self, develops shame, defends against need with anger, may develop bitterness or expectation of rejection
5. The cherished child becomes capable of cherishing their own children; the unchurished child struggles with the same challenges their parents faced
6. Intervention point: Getting support to heal one's own wounds can break the intergenerational cycle
