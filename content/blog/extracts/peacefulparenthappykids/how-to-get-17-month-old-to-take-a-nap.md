# Helping Toddlers Who Struggle to Fall Asleep

## The Core Problem: Why Toddlers Resist Sleep

Toddlers around 17 months are so excited about their new motor skills and physical capabilities that they often have a hard time settling down. Their bodies want to move and explore, making the transition to stillness and sleep difficult.

However, physical energy is not the only factor. A deeper and very common reason children struggle to settle into sleep is **emotional backlog**. All kids accumulate an "emotional backpack" of emotions and sensations that they don't get a safe chance to feel and process during their day. As they lie down to sleep and the ego controls of executive function relax, those stored emotions bubble up to be processed. Kids don't like this feeling because those emotions got stuffed in the first place precisely because they didn't feel good to experience. So kids run from those emotions by being silly, provocative, or literally running around the room.

This explains why a child might spend two hours flopping around the bed, running around the room, crying, and laughing before finally calming down enough to sleep. The child isn't being defiant - they're avoiding the uncomfortable feelings that surface when they try to be still.

## Prevention: Creating Conditions for Easier Sleep

Before addressing the emotional component, several environmental and routine factors should be in place:

**Physical exercise**: Is the child getting outside to run around every morning and afternoon? A toddler needs to expend physical energy to be ready for rest.

**Actual tiredness**: Is the child actually tired? If tired but unable to wind down, would they respond to music or a story?

**Sleep-cue music**: Playing the same very relaxing CD every time you take the child to bed creates a conditioned response. Choose music you can tolerate hearing repeatedly. After the child falls asleep to it a few times, it will begin to cue their body to relax automatically.

**Soothing massage**: Would the child settle down for a massage? Physical touch can help transition from active to calm states.

**Darkness**: Is the room VERY dark? Blackout curtains are strongly recommended.

**Consistent timing**: Is the nap at the same time every day?

**Pre-sleep routine**: Is there a consistent routine leading up to sleep?

## The Emotional Backpack: Understanding What's Really Happening

**The mechanism**: Children store emotions throughout the day that they didn't fully process. When they lie down and their mind quiets, these feelings surface. The child instinctively avoids these feelings through activity.

**Emptying the backpack through laughter**: Daily roughhousing that gets kids belly-laughing is strongly recommended because laughter empties the emotional backpack. This is a preventive measure to reduce the emotional load the child carries into sleep time.

**The role of crying**: Sometimes there is no substitute for crying, which does "deeper cleaning" of the emotional backpack than laughter. However, crying isn't magic in itself. What's transformative is the experiencing of those stored-up upsets in the compassion of a safe presence. Crying is just the expression. The key is creating safety through acceptance of the feelings and love for the child as they cry, while holding them or staying very close.

## The Intervention: Limit-Setting with Emotional Safety

### The Approach

It is appropriate to set a limit and say "Now it is time to sleep." A 17-month-old clearly needs a nap, and you can be firm about this while still being present and compassionate. The key difference from conventional sleep training: **do not leave the child alone to cry in a crib**. Stay with them.

**The specific technique**: When the child tries to get up and run around, gently restrain them and explain tenderly but firmly that it is nap time and you will help them settle down and stay in bed.

### What to Expect

The child will use the opportunity to cry and protest. This is a good thing, not a problem. They will show you all the anxieties and upsets they have built up that day, and probably for months, that are making them so wound up.

**Physical manifestation of fear**: When kids are feeling fear, they writhe and struggle. This is normal and does not mean you are hurting them by keeping them in bed. Keep reassuring them that they're safe, you are with them, and you love them.

### Reassurance Phrases That Work

The example from the parent's follow-up shows the power of specific reassurances: "I am your mother and I love you no matter what and will never leave you." In this case, saying these words caused a look of fear to spread across the child's face as deeper feelings surfaced, followed by the child clinging and crying. The child then snuggled into a position reminiscent of breastfeeding (the child had been weaned at 14 months) and calmed down peacefully.

### Timing Consideration

Do the deep laughing/roughhousing earlier in the day (such as before lunch), not right before nap. This prevents the child from getting too riled up immediately before sleep while still emptying the emotional backpack.

## Critical Caveats

**You must stay calm**: You must be able to stay calm, compassionate, and loving when doing this. Your goal is to create safety. If you get angry, your child will sense it and will not feel safe. The approach fails if the parent cannot maintain emotional regulation.

**Trauma exclusion**: This approach is not recommended with a child who has a trauma background. If that is the case, get support from a professional.

## Expected Outcomes

After kids get a chance to empty their emotional backpacks, they usually fall fast asleep more quickly than usual because they are not fighting off all those anxieties.

If you do this a few times:
- The child will be happier and calmer because they aren't carrying all those feelings around
- They will find it easier to lie down and fall asleep
- They will start doing it consistently every day

## What NOT to Do

**Do not leave the child alone to cry in a crib** as conventional parenting recommends. This removes the safety component that makes emotional processing possible.

**Do not allow free running around the room** during nap time or bedtime. While gentle, this boundary needs to be held.

**Do not get angry or frustrated visibly**. The child must feel safe for the emotional processing to work. Your emotional state is part of the container you're creating.

## Case Study Details

The specific case involved:
- A 17-month-old boy
- Two hours to fall asleep for both nap and bedtime (four hours total daily devoted to sleep attempts)
- Family bed arrangement
- Mother emotionally drained to the point of dreading nap time mornings
- Second baby due in a few months (creating time pressure and possibly contributing to child's anxiety about changes)
- Child had been gently weaned at 14 months due to the pregnancy

The underlying issue revealed through the intervention: The child appeared to be carrying fear related to changes happening due to the pregnancy. The mother noted she couldn't lift him as much as she used to. When given the chance to process these feelings with reassurance, the child regressed to his breastfeeding position, processed his emotions, and fell asleep faster than ever before.

This illustrates how major life changes (new sibling arriving, weaning, changes in physical affection patterns) can create stored emotions that interfere with sleep.
