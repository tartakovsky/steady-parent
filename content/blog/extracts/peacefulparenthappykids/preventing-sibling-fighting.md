# Preventing Sibling Fighting

## Core Philosophy: Conflict as Learning Opportunity

The goal is not to eliminate all sibling fighting. Conflict is a natural part of every human relationship, and children learn critical skills through fighting with each other:
- How to express their needs and wants
- How to respectfully set boundaries on other people's behavior
- How to problem-solve to find solutions that work for both parties

The realistic goal is to **reduce fighting frequency** and **make the fights that do occur more civil**.

## Foundational Principle: Modeling and Environment Shape Behavior

### Anger Management Example

Children learn how to handle anger primarily through observation. Parents must treat everyone, including their children, respectfully. This means:
- No swearing when someone cuts you off in traffic
- No demeaning asides about your partner (forgetting to fill the gas tank, etc.)
- No yelling at the kids

**Critical insight**: Yelling teaches children to yell at each other. The causal chain is direct: parent yells -> child internalizes yelling as acceptable conflict response -> child yells at siblings.

### The Punishment Trap

**Punishment** is defined as causing another person physical or emotional pain to get them to do what we want. While parents may see punishment as teaching a lesson, children perceive it differently: they see punishment as the way more powerful people make less powerful people do what they want.

The consequences of this perception:
- If you give timeouts, children learn to use **social exclusion** as a way to get people to do what they want
- Research repeatedly shows that punished children are more angry, more likely to fight with each other, and more likely to repeat misbehaviors
- This extends to yelling, which teaches children to yell

**Alternative**: Use Peaceful Parenting, which strengthens the parent-child relationship so children want to behave, while modeling appropriate anger management.

## Teaching Negotiation and Problem-Solving Skills

Teach children basic negotiation guided by the concept of **win/win solutions**:

1. **Taking turns** - Simple temporal sharing
2. **Dividing a treat** - One person does the dividing, the other picks the first piece (ensures fairness through self-interest)
3. **Trading** - Exchange of items or privileges
4. **Sweetening the deal** - Adding value to make an offer acceptable: "We play your game first and then my game for longer"

## Establishing Respect Standards

### Clear Family Rules

Articulate explicit standards for the household:
- "We don't call people names or tolerate meanness in this house. We treat each other with respect."
- "No name calling. You can tell your brother how mad you are at him without calling names."

**Key distinction**: Children can disagree, but there is always a way to stay respectful even when angry.

### The Repair Framework

When anyone (including adults) forgets themselves and is disrespectful or calls names, they must **repair** the damage done to the relationship. Repair actions include:
- Doing a favor for the person
- Helping rebuild something you knocked down
- Making a card

This teaches that relationships require maintenance and that harmful actions have consequences requiring active restoration.

## Building Team Identity Between Siblings

### The Cooperation Jar System

A structured approach to reinforcing positive sibling interactions:
- Place a coin in the jar every time you observe children being nice to each other
- Playing without fighting earns coins
- Expressing feelings in an appropriate, respectful way earns coins (especially valuable because this is hard for children)
- Remove one or more coins whenever children fight
- Children decide together how to spend the accumulated money

**Why this works**: It makes children partners in avoiding fights, creates shared investment in cooperation, and requires collaboration even in deciding how to use the reward.

## Emotional Validation and Limit Setting

### The Balance

Children are entitled to their feelings, which "show up in human beings, like our arms and legs." However, all humans, including small children, should be held responsible for what they do with their arms, legs, and feelings.

### Script Examples

**Anger at sibling messing with belongings**:
"When your brother messes with your things you get really angry. You can tell him how it makes you feel in words. We don't hit."

**Jealousy about unequal privileges**:
"You wish you could stay up a half an hour later, like your sister. When you're in third grade, you'll be able to also. In the meantime, you can tell me if you're jealous of your sister, but you can't mess up her room."

These scripts demonstrate the pattern: acknowledge the feeling -> set the behavioral limit -> offer an acceptable alternative.

## Teaching Self-Management Techniques

### Why This Is Challenging

Most adults never learned to regulate their own emotions as children, so these skills are often not modeled well. This creates a gap that must be addressed consciously.

### Creating the Anger Management List

When children are calm (not during conflict), make a game of working together on a list of healthy ways to handle anger:
- Play the drums
- Write in your journal about how angry you are
- Dig a hole in the back yard and bury your angries
- Breathe and count backwards from 10
- Get a grownup
- Put on headphones and dance to loud music
- Kick the soccerball outside

### Implementation

1. Be explicit that hitting, scratching, and pinching are never appropriate actions toward other people
2. Post the list on the fridge
3. **Model using the list**: When you get mad, refer to the list in front of children to demonstrate its use

---

## Validation as Foundation for Emotional Management

**Validating emotion is the first step in a child learning to manage it.**

### Daily Practice

As you go through daily life, notice children's emotions and comment non-judgmentally:
- "It's so frustrating when you work hard on something and it collapses like that. No wonder you're angry."
- "I wonder if you were jealous when your friend went off with that other child."

### What NOT to Do

- Don't try to solve their problems
- Don't try to talk them out of their feelings

**The goal**: Simply acknowledge feelings so children learn to acknowledge their own feelings.

---

## Cultivating Empathy

### Commenting on Others' Feelings

Draw children's attention to other people's emotional states:
- "Look at Michael. He's crying. I think his feelings are hurt."
- "That little girl is sure mad. I wonder why?"
- "Neela hurt herself. I wonder if we can do anything to help her feel better?"

### The Foundation

Offering children empathy for their own feelings is the foundation of their developing empathy for each other. Children who feel understood become children who seek to understand others.

## Diffusing Anger to Resolve Conflicts Peacefully

This is described as an important emotional intelligence skill that most people never learn. It warrants ongoing discussion with children.

### Techniques to Teach and Post

- Acknowledge their point of view
- Express your needs without attacking them
- Stay respectful
- Stay in the current issue, don't bring up past conflicts

**Expected outcome**: Children will add to this list and use these techniques, often surprising parents with their capability.

## Addressing the "Hitter" - Private Intervention

### Understanding the Root Cause

When one child consistently hits, privately investigate what is making them so angry:
- Is she afraid that her sibling is loved more?
- Does she just want her way, and consequences for hitting have not dissuaded her?

### The Therapeutic Effect

Having a chance to feel heard about her upset will diminish the force of her feelings so that she doesn't have to act on them. The expression of emotion reduces its pressure.

### Age-Appropriate Expectations

**Example**: An 8-year-old is old enough to control her temper, but children do often hit siblings at this age even when they would never hit someone else.

**The privilege-responsibility framework**: Just as older children get extra privileges like staying up later, they also have the extra responsibility of never hitting a younger child.

### The Code Word Technique

Teach children that when they get mad, they can:
1. Yell a code word like "STOP!"
2. Clap their arms around their body (right hand on left shoulder or under left arm, and vice versa)

**Why this works**: It redirects the feeling of wanting to lash out (to protect oneself) into a self-hug that contains and protects. The physical action channels the aggressive impulse into a self-soothing behavior.

### Setting Clear Expectations

- She can call you if she needs assistance resolving a problem with her sibling
- Calmly but firmly communicate that you expect her to control her emotions
- She must use her words and NOT touch her sibling in anger

## Modeling Conflict Resolution with Adults

### The Myth of "Fighting Things Out"

Contrary to popular belief, "fighting" never works things out constructively.

### The Alternative Process

1. Take a **cool-off period**
2. Come back determined to stay calm
3. Acknowledge the other person's view
4. Express your own needs
5. Talk things out

Children learn conflict resolution by watching parents resolve conflicts with partners and other adults.

## Creating an Atmosphere of Appreciation

### The Dinner Appreciation Ritual

Every night at dinner, have each person find at least one specific thing to appreciate about each other person:
- "I appreciate that Jillian helped me with my homework."
- "I appreciate that Mommy played my game with me."
- "I appreciate that Daddy made my favorite dinner."
- "I appreciate that Danny didn't bother us when my friends came over to play."

**Note**: Appreciations should be specific, not generic. This teaches children to notice and value positive actions.

---

## Maintaining Perspective and Avoiding Shame

### Normal Behavior Framing

Just because one child punches another doesn't mean he'll become a criminal. Setting limits on behavior does not preclude offering understanding and confidence that the child will learn.

### The Anti-Shame Message

Instead of shame, children need to hear:
- "All kids get mad at their siblings sometimes."
- "It will be easier, as you get older, to remember how to control yourself when you get mad, so you can work things out."

**What to communicate**: The child isn't a bad person, just a young person who is still developing the skills and neural wiring to manage big emotions. The child always has parental love and support, no matter what.

## Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Yelling at children** - Directly teaches them to yell at each other
2. **Using timeouts** - Teaches social exclusion as a manipulation tactic
3. **Punishment generally** - Makes children more angry and more likely to fight
4. **Trying to eliminate all conflict** - Deprives children of learning opportunities
5. **Solving children's problems for them** - Prevents development of problem-solving skills
6. **Talking children out of feelings** - Invalidates emotions and prevents emotional processing
7. **Shaming children for aggressive behavior** - Creates identity-level damage instead of skill-building
8. **Bringing up past conflicts during current disputes** - Escalates rather than resolves
9. **Expecting anger management skills that were never taught** - Most adults lack these skills themselves

## Summary of Posting Lists

Two lists should be created with children and posted on the refrigerator:
1. **Healthy ways to handle anger** - Personal self-management techniques
2. **How to diffuse anger in others** - Interpersonal conflict resolution techniques

Both lists should be co-created with children and modeled by parents in use.
