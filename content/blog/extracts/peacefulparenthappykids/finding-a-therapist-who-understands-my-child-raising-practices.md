# Finding a Therapist Who Understands Peaceful Parenting Practices

## The Core Problem: Most Adult Therapists Lack Updated Child Development Training

Therapists who treat adults typically have little or no ongoing education in child development. This means they are often not up to date on:
- **Brain development research** - for instance, why letting children cry without a parent holding them is harmful
- **Attachment theory** and its practical implications
- Recent advances in understanding parent-child relationships

Even Ivy League PhD programs (as of approximately 20 years ago) taught "pretty old-fashioned" child development material. The implication is that formal training alone does not guarantee a therapist understands modern attachment-informed or peaceful parenting approaches.

**Complicating factor with parent-therapists**: If a therapist is also a parent, this can either help or hurt the therapeutic relationship. It depends entirely on what parenting approach they used with their own children and how they feel about those relationships. A therapist who used conventional discipline methods may have difficulty supporting a parent trying to do something different.

## The Screening Framework: Treat It Like Finding a Pediatrician

The recommended approach is to **screen potential therapists just as you would screen a pediatrician** - through brief preliminary conversations that reveal their philosophy and approach.

**Example of pediatrician screening questions** (to illustrate the concept):
- How long do mothers in your practice typically breastfeed?
- What is your position on sleep-training?
- Do you always prescribe antibiotics for ear infections?
- Are you flexible about spacing out the vaccination schedule?

These questions reveal underlying philosophy, not just credentials. The same principle applies to therapist screening.

Most therapists would be willing to spend **ten minutes on the phone** answering preliminary questions. It is standard practice to ask about approach, fees, and logistics - adding a few philosophy questions is reasonable.

## The Four Screening Questions for Therapists

### Question 1: What's Your Training?

**What you're looking for:**
- Proper credentials (baseline requirement)
- **Experience matters more than credentials alone** - therapists improve with practice over time ("within reason")
- Training in working with children is a positive signal

**Caveat about family therapists**: Family therapy training is "usually but not always helpful." Family therapists vary significantly in their actual understanding of child development. The credential alone does not guarantee alignment with peaceful parenting principles.

### Question 2: Do You Work with Children Also, or Only Adults?

**Why this matters**: Therapists who work with children as well as adults will necessarily have developed an articulated, explicit view about parenting. This view may or may not align with yours, but at least they will have one that you can evaluate.

The underlying logic: working with children forces a therapist to think through parenting issues systematically, whereas an adult-only therapist may have vague or unexamined assumptions about child-raising.

### Question 3: Introducing Your Concern Directly

This is a script for surfacing potential philosophical conflicts:

> "I'm a mother, so there will be times when I will be talking about issues with my kids. I've had experiences with therapists who had a very different approach to child-raising than I have, and I found that not to be helpful. I realize you are a therapist, not a parenting coach, but I'd like the support of a therapist who can help me to live up to my own parenting ideals. What would be your approach when I talk about what's happening with my kids?"

**Key elements of this framing:**
- Acknowledges the therapist's role is not parenting coach
- Makes clear you have your own parenting ideals you want support in living up to
- Asks directly how they would respond when parenting topics arise
- Signals that philosophical misalignment has been a real problem in the past

### Question 4a: What Parenting Books Do You Read and Recommend?

This question reveals whether the therapist is familiar with attachment-informed, peaceful parenting literature.

**Authors who signal alignment:**
- **Margot Sunderland** - mentioned first
- **Alfie Kohn** - mentioned first
- **Dan Siegel** - mentioned first (note: spelling in original is "Seigel")
- Attachment researchers broadly ("new wave of Attachment researchers")

**Less well-known but "terrific" authors:**
- **Heather Forbes**
- **Gordon Neufeld**
- **Ross Greene**

**First-wave positive parenting authors** (who popularized earlier work):
- **Faber and Mazlish** - popularized Haim Ginott's work
- **Jane Nelsen** - known as "the Positive Discipline lady"
  - Important distinction: Her early work still recommended consequences, but her later work moved away from this and is "very good"
  - She has reached mainstream recognition, so many people know of her

### Question 4b: What's Your Philosophy of Discipline? What Do You Recommend for Basic Discipline at the Age My Kids Are?

This is the critical screening question that separates conventional therapists from those aligned with peaceful parenting.

**Baseline expectations (what any reputable therapist would say):**
- No therapist would recommend spanking
- All therapists acknowledge the parent-child relationship is most important

**The red flag to watch for**: Recommendations for **timeouts** and especially **consequences**. This signals someone who "has not researched or reflected on these issues."

**Why this is a problem**: Timeouts and parent-imposed consequences are still punishments. The key insight is that **punishments always create worse behavior**, not better. Mainstream professionals who recommend these approaches have not realized that these methods undermine the outcomes they are trying to achieve.

**What you're looking for instead:**
- No recommendation of timeouts
- No recommendation of consequences (meaning something imposed by the parent)
- Discussion of **setting limits with empathy**
- Discussion of **helping children make repairs** (rather than imposing consequences)

## Two Critical Concepts the Therapist Should Mention Voluntarily

A well-aligned therapist will bring up these points without being prompted:

### 1. The Parent's Emotional Self-Regulation Is the Real Work

The therapist should recognize that **the real work is in regulating our own emotions as the parent**. The reasoning: parents always have the capacity to either lessen or increase the negativity when their children are upset. How the parent manages their own emotional state directly shapes how conflict and upset unfold.

This principle places the locus of control and responsibility on the parent's internal state, not on managing the child's behavior through external techniques.

### 2. The Importance of Cultivating a Good Relationship with Your Child

The therapist should emphasize relationship quality as foundational - not as a nice addition to discipline techniques, but as the core of the approach.

## Qualities of an Effective Therapist Beyond Philosophy

Beyond philosophical alignment, an effective therapist should be:
- **Warm and empathic**
- Make you feel **comfortable and accepted exactly as you are**
- Simultaneously be **fully present to support you to grow and change**

This is not a contradiction - genuine acceptance and support for growth coexist. The therapist accepts the person while supporting their development, rather than accepting current limitations as permanent.
