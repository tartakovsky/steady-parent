## The Nature of Intimacy in Family Relationships

**Intimacy** serves multiple essential functions in family life. It is the glue that strengthens family bonds over time and across physical distance. It provides resilience to get through hard times. It acts as the "grease" that smooths rough everyday interactions. It is the "honey" that makes family life worthwhile.

Intimacy is difficult to define precisely, but it is universally recognized experientially. Whether snuggling in companionable silence with a partner or crying on a friend's shoulder, intimacy is the feeling of being connected to another person.

The process of building, deepening, and repairing human connections is simultaneously as simple as a warm smile and as mysterious as the visceral response to seeing a picture of someone loved and lost.

## The Bids Framework: How Intimacy Is Built

### Core Research Foundation

**John Gottman**, one of the most influential researchers worldwide on family dynamics, has identified the practical building blocks of intimate relationships. His research reveals that **the building blocks of connection are the small overtures we make to each other every day, and the way our loved ones respond**.

### The Concept of Bids

Gottman calls these overtures **"bids"** (as in "bids for attention"). They can also be understood as **overtures** (as in opening movements). A bid is any attempt to connect with another person, ranging from a comment about one's day to sharing a worry or asking a question.

### How Bids Build Relationships

In happy relationships, whether between romantic partners, parents and children, friends, or coworkers, bids are made and responded to warmly. The specific content of the bid matters less than the process itself. The act of reaching out and receiving a response builds the relationship.

This cycle creates a self-reinforcing positive pattern:
1. A bid is made and warmly received
2. Trust increases
3. The person is more likely to reach out again
4. The content of future bids deepens (becomes more vulnerable/meaningful)

**Example of positive bid cycle**: If someone begins with "I'm worried about XYZ" and receives an empathic response, they're likely to elaborate and potentially ask for support. Their trust in reaching out is rewarded with caring. Both people end the interaction feeling closer.

### How Missed Bids Damage Relationships

When a bid is ignored or greeted with anything that doesn't feel empathic, the person is unlikely to make themselves vulnerable again. The relationship loses an opportunity to deepen. More damaging: the person feels hurt, so "a little wall gets built."

This same process plays out in hundreds of daily parent-child interactions.

**Example with a middle schooler**: If you ask about an upcoming school dance and receive an engaged response, you might venture further and ask if she's nervous, taking the conversation deeper. If her response is surly, most parents will back off, and the opportunity for connection is lost.

## Children Testing Parents Through Negative Bids

Children often test parents by saying something negative to see if the parent will empathize. This is a form of bid. They are checking: "Can you handle my authentic feelings?"

**If the parent responds with understanding** (even to negativity), children trust that the parent can handle their real feelings, and they open up more.

**If the parent ignores, denies feelings, corrects, or judges**, children shut down.

### The Cumulative Effect of Missed Bids

When negative interactions are repeated often, children develop a habit of hiding their feelings. The consequences compound:
- They stop reaching out to parents
- They more frequently reject parents' bids to connect with them

This creates a deteriorating cycle where both sides become less likely to attempt connection.

**Key insight**: A parent's ability to accept their child's emotions, even when those emotions are "negative," is the foundation of the child feeling seen and safe with the parent.

## Five Practices for Building Closer Connection

### Practice 1: Respond to Your Child's Bids Whenever Possible

**The core challenge**: Children initiate bids whenever they feel or want something, which means the parent is typically busy doing something else. It requires genuine self-discipline to tear yourself away from what you're doing (especially a phone) to answer a child's question.

**Why timing matters**: How you respond to their overture is crucial in building closeness. Later, when you try to get them to tell you about school (your bid), they've already shut down because their earlier bid wasn't received.

**Powerful practice suggestion**: Make it a habit to turn off devices when with your child. This is acknowledged as a "heavy lift," but children often say that their parent's phone seems more important to the parent than they are. Connection transforms when devices are put away.

**When immediate response isn't possible**: At minimum, acknowledge what the child is expressing:

> "It sounds like you're worried about the recital. That sounds like a lot of pressure. Right now I really need to get to my meeting, but I hear how important this is to you. Can we talk about your recital when I get home tonight?"

**Why partial acknowledgment helps**: The child won't be as interested in talking later as they are right now, but they heard that you cared. When you bring it up later, they're less likely to shut the conversation down entirely.

### Practice 2: Train Yourself to Respond with Empathy, No Matter What the Comment Is

**The common trap**: When a child or teen greets you with a negative comment after school, like "Dad, you know I hate that music, can't we listen to my music?" or "Mom, I had a terrible day and it's all your fault because you...", this sets up an argument. Most parents take the bait. The result: raised voices, defensiveness, surly silence, mutual resentment. Another brick in the wall.

**Reframing the negative comment as a bid**: That negative comment is actually a bid in disguise. The child is asking:
- Will you commiserate with me?
- Do you care about what matters to me?
- Will you listen to my tale of woe so I can process my upset?
- Will you help me make things better?

**The human reaction**: Naturally, you feel attacked and want to snap at her. This is normal.

**The practice**: Take a deep breath and respond with empathy. This can turn the entire situation around.

**Example responses**:

For the music complaint:
> "Really, you don't like the Rolling Stones? My most favorite band of all time? I guess this IS a little loud... Okay, I'll turn this off and we can talk while we drive about what music to play, so we can find something we both like."

For the blame statement:
> "Wow, you sound like you had a really terrible day! Tell me about it."

**What happens next**: Later, you can ask if she really thinks her terrible day was all your fault. She'll almost certainly sheepishly apologize. Instead of a fight, you've deepened the relationship.

### Practice 3: If You Don't Get the Response You Want, Examine Your Own Initiation

When reaching out doesn't yield the hoped-for response, step back and examine how you're initiating. Ask yourself: Are you inviting a positive response?

**Core principle**: If what you want is connection, don't start with correction. Always connect before you correct or request.

### Practice 4: When Greeted with Hurtful Responses, Acknowledge Vulnerability Rather Than Attacking Back

When you make an overture and receive something hurtful (disdain, sarcasm, or blankness), the temptation is to respond with anger.

**The alternative approach**:
1. Say "Ouch!"
2. Turn away (before giving in to the temptation to lash out)

**Why this works**: Your child (or partner) will almost certainly feel badly about having hurt you, especially since you haven't inflamed the drama by attacking back.

**The follow-up conversation**: Later, when you aren't feeling so hurt and angry, tell them how their response made you feel.

**How to structure that conversation**:
- Talk only about your feelings
- Don't frame it as them being wrong
- Invite them to share any resentments that were driving their hurtful response

**Example script**:
> "Sweetheart, when you said that I always take your brother's side, I felt hurt because I try so hard to be fair, and your voice sounded so angry. But it sounds like you really think I'm being unfair. That must hurt you. Tell me more about that."

This approach models vulnerability, avoids escalation, and opens space for the child to share what's underneath their reaction.

### Practice 5: Build Intimate Interactions Into Daily Routines

**The common problem**: Parents often go whole days or even weeks just moving kids through the schedule without taking time to really connect. Most parents can't imagine where they would find more time to connect.

**The solution**: Look for opportunities already in your schedule where you can slow down and create an opportunity for closeness.

**Examples of routine connection opportunities**:
- When helping with hair in the morning (take lots of time for hugs and kisses)
- When in the car with just one child in the afternoon
- At bedtime when lying with each child for ten minutes

**Specific habits to establish**:
- Initiate good morning hugs
- Initiate goodbye hugs
- Turn off devices when with your child to allow natural interactions of the moment to deepen

## The Ongoing Nature of Intimacy

**Intimacy is described as a dance.** It deepens or is eroded by every interaction. This framing has both a challenging and hopeful implication:

**The hopeful implication**: Every interaction is a chance to shift onto a positive track and deepen connection.

**Practical application**: Simply paying attention for a week to how you respond when your children reach out can shift the whole tone in the family. Awareness itself creates change.
