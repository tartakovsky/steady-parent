## The Power of Parental Expectations

One of the most fundamental ways parents influence their children's relationship with each other is through the expectations they hold about it. This works through a transmission mechanism: if parents hold certain expectations, they will transmit those assumptions to their children, who then internalize them.

**Key expectations to cultivate:**
- As a family, we will always work things out with each other
- We deeply value our relationships with each other
- Siblings have a unique bond that is to be treasured and protected

The reasoning behind this approach is that children absorb their parents' assumptions about relationships. When parents treat sibling conflict as normal but resolvable, and sibling bonds as precious and permanent, children adopt this same framework for understanding their own relationships.

## Building Family Culture That Supports Sibling Closeness

The goal is to build a **family culture** that actively supports sibling closeness. This is not about individual interventions but about creating an ongoing environment and set of shared beliefs.

## The Sibling Book Technique

**Creating a "sibling book"** is a specific technique to help children see their relationship positively. This personalized book helps children understand a key message: even though they may fight with their sibling, siblings always work things out.

**Why this works:**
- Stories that feature the children themselves make concepts personal and memorable
- The book provides a narrative framework for understanding conflict as temporary
- Repeated reading reinforces the expectation that resolution is always possible
- Personalization makes the message relevant to the specific children

**Implementation:**
- A downloadable Word document template is available to make creation easier
- Parents should personalize the story, words, and picture choices to fit their specific children and situations
- The template is titled "Siblings Are Forever" (or "Brothers Are Forever" in the original document name)

## Core Framework from Peaceful Parent, Happy Siblings

The broader approach described in Dr. Laura Markham's book includes:

1. **Parent as model and coach** - How family emotions work, with the parent serving as both a role model and active coach for emotional skills

2. **Allowing children's feelings and responding with empathy** - This produces learning in children (though the specific list of what children learn is referenced but not detailed in this source)

3. **Respectful, attuned, limit-setting approach applied to sibling dynamics** - The same principles that work for individual parent-child relationships apply to sibling relationships

4. **Turning conflict into opportunities** - Parental intervention during sibling conflict is not just about stopping fights but about building skills

5. **Honoring each child's experience** - Each sibling's perspective matters and should be acknowledged

6. **Reducing conflict while building skills for life** - The dual goal is both immediate peace and long-term capability

## Reframing Parental Dread

A notable shift in perspective: parental dread about sibling conflict can be transformed into meaningful intervention. This reframe helps parents see their role not as referee who must stop fighting, but as coach who uses conflict moments for teaching.
