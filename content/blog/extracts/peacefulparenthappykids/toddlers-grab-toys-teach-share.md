## Core Understanding: Why Toddlers Grab

**Grabbing toys is completely normal behavior for toddlers around 26 months old.** This is not a sign of a problematic child or bad parenting. The underlying goal for parents is to teach the child that other kids have feelings too.

### The Deeper Need Behind Grabbing

When a toddler persistently tries to take toys from other children (and the other children don't want to give them up), this often signals that the child has **big feelings that need help being worked through**. The behavior looks like a need for that specific toy, but the actual need is stronger and deeper than the particular toy itself. Until those feelings come out and are expressed, the child cannot:
- "Work with" another child effectively
- Manage their own intense internal need

The child needs parental help to **express that feeling so it will evaporate**, after which they can play better with other kids.

## When Not to Intervene

**Sometimes you won't need to get involved at all.** When babies and toddlers both want a toy, they often resolve the dispute without adult intervention. This is part of how they learn to navigate a complicated social world. Let natural resolution happen when possible.

## The Intervention Framework

### Step 1: Position Yourself Strategically

Get down on the children's level, right next to them. This positioning serves a critical function: you can see the dispute coming before it escalates.

### Step 2: Narrate to Create Understanding

When your child gets interested in a toy another child has, use **narration** to help her understand what's happening. Example narration:

> "Amber has the doll... you like that doll... you want the doll, too... but Amber isn't done with it yet... She doesn't want to let go, does she?... Looks like we have to wait for our turn... let's find something else to do."

**Why narration works:** When you talk to your daughter like this, she feels heard. She doesn't get the toy, but she has made her desire clear, and you paid attention. This acknowledgment typically causes the child to let go of the toy and turn her attention elsewhere. The feeling of being heard substitutes for the need to possess.

### Step 3: Respond Based on Outcome

**Scenario A: The other child willingly gives up the toy**

If the other child lets go and seems okay with it, you can acknowledge this: "Oh, Amber gave you the doll... Is that ok, Amber? Thank you, Amber." This models checking in with others' feelings and expressing gratitude.

**Scenario B: The other child is distressed**

If the other child looks stricken or begins to cry, you must intervene: "Sweetie, this is not ok with Amber... she wasn't ready for you to have the doll yet. It's still Amber's turn... let's give the doll back and wait our turn... I will help you wait."

**Scenario C: The other child hangs on but your child keeps pulling**

This gets the same treatment as Scenario B. The other child not letting go is equivalent to them being upset - both indicate they weren't ready to give up the toy.

## The Physical Containment Technique

When your child insists on pulling at the toy and won't let go, use this specific physical positioning:

1. **Put one hand on the toy** - This prevents your daughter from grabbing it away
2. **Put one arm around your daughter with your hand on her stomach** - This "contains" her

**The science behind the belly touch:** The hand on the belly is connected to the **insula**, which is the source of empathy and a pathway to your daughter's feelings. This touch helps your daughter move out of "fight" mode and into her own feelings. It shifts the nervous system state.

While holding this position, say: "Sweetie, it is Amber's turn with the doll... you need to wait... I will help you wait... Come."

### The Ideal Response: Tears

**The goal is for your child to start crying.** Hopefully, she will bury her face in your shoulder and burst into tears, letting go of the toy while crying. If she does not start crying and/or does not let go of the toy, you may have to pick her up and move her a bit away, dislodging the toy at the same time.

**Critical warning:** Try to avoid wrenching the toy away from her, because that just teaches her to grab. The method of removal matters - if you model grabbing, you teach grabbing.

## Processing the Big Feelings

When you move her away from the toy and the other child, she will almost certainly be crying. **This is good.** Support her to cry with words like: "You really want that toy... it is hard to wait... I will help you wait."

### Why Crying Is the Goal

Once the big feelings driving her to grab are **melted away by the tears**, she will:
- Feel much better
- Be better able to engage in positive, appropriate give and take with other kids
- Stop over-powering them
- Probably won't even be interested in that particular toy anymore

This last point is key evidence that the grabbing was never really about the specific toy. It was about unexpressed feelings that needed release.

## Key Phrases to Use

Throughout the process, the phrase **"I will help you wait"** is repeated. This communicates:
- Waiting is the requirement (boundary is clear)
- You are not abandoning her to struggle alone (support is present)
- This is something you do together (connection maintained)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Forcing the child's hand off the toy** - While understandable as a response, wrenching toys away teaches grabbing behavior. The child learns that the bigger/stronger person can just take things.

2. **Worrying excessively** - This behavior is developmentally normal for this age. Worry doesn't help and may communicate anxiety to the child.

3. **Expecting the child to listen to verbal requests alone** - Simply asking a toddler not to grab typically won't work when they're in "fight" mode. Physical containment and emotional support are needed.

4. **Intervening every time** - Sometimes children resolve disputes naturally and that's valuable learning. Only intervene when needed.
