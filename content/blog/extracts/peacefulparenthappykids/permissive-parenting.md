## The Core Challenge Parents Face

Most parents hate causing their child to get upset. They don't want to incite tantrums, and they don't want their child to be angry at them. On top of that, it's genuinely difficult to know whether what we're asking is developmentally reasonable. And parents are tired, which makes limit-setting even harder.

Despite these challenges, **setting limits is an essential part of good parenting**. The reason lies in how children develop: infants' wants are identical to their needs, but over time this changes. By the toddler stage, children's wants are often in direct opposition to their long-term developmental needs and safety. Parents must make this developmental leap and learn to set limits accordingly.

## The Foundational Principle

Kids need limits for healthy emotional development. However, these should not be unreasonable limits. They should be **empathic limits set in the context of a strong parent-child connection**. The goal is appropriate limits, not harsh or arbitrary ones.

When parents fail to set limits, children don't develop the ability to tolerate frustration or to manage themselves. Research shows that without limits, kids have fewer opportunities to develop self-discipline. These children are often described by others as "spoiled."

## Nine Consequences of Permissive Parenting

### 1. Harmful Consequences from Granting Inappropriate Desires

When parents grant desires that should not be granted, it leads to harmful consequences. For example, regularly letting a child stay up too late results in a cranky, exhausted child who cannot handle normal age-appropriate developmental tasks. This creates a compound problem: not only is the child less pleasant to live with, but the child's self-esteem suffers because she can't manage things as well as other kids do.

### 2. Child's Desires Met at Others' Expense

When a child's desires are consistently met at the expense of someone else (a sibling, the parent, other people in a restaurant, etc.), there are consequences beyond the impact on those other people. The child learns that she always gets her way in relationships. This pattern makes it hard for her to make friends or have satisfying romantic relationships later in life. This is why permissively raised kids are often described as "self-centered" or "spoiled."

### 3. Learning That Disappointment Is Intolerable

When a child realizes, even on some level, that her parents will do almost anything to prevent her from experiencing disappointment, she learns that disappointment and sadness are intolerable. She then spends the rest of her life doing whatever is necessary to avoid feeling what she fears will be unbearable.

This avoidance behavior can manifest in destructive ways:
- Avoiding all risks
- Insisting that she must always have her way
- Cheating to win

Because she never learns to feel comfortable with challenging feelings, she develops low EQ (emotional intelligence).

### 4. Failure to Develop Self-Discipline

When a child never learns to lovingly impose limits on herself, she misses out on a crucial self-management skill needed for adulthood and even for high school. Without self-discipline, she cannot work toward goals, which is a necessary component of creating a happy life. Permissive parenting therefore sabotages her ability to achieve in life.

### 5. Misunderstanding the Source of Happiness

When children don't experience limits, they never learn that happiness is not derived from wish fulfillment and having one desire after another met. They don't discover that happiness can actually be maintained in the face of disappointment. As a result, the child is likely to spend his life pursuing one "thing" after another that he thinks will make him happy, only to find that happiness eludes him.

### 6. Difficulty Developing Stable Internal Happiness

Permissive parenting makes it harder for children to develop stable internal happiness that doesn't depend on outside circumstances. This happens because they have a harder time developing deep positive self-regard.

**The mechanism**: Stable internal happiness comes from having one's full range of self accepted and understood, including the angry, sad, and disappointed parts. When parents act like those parts of the child are to be avoided, they send the message that part of the child's self is unacceptable. The takeaway for kids is that they are not fully lovable.

### 7. Children Need Parents to Be in Charge

Kids need to know that their parents have a different role than they do, one that includes keeping them safe. When people say "kids will keep pushing till they find the limits," this is what they mean. Children want limits because they want someone to be in charge. It's terrifying for a child to think that no one is in charge, protecting them from what can feel like a frightening world.

### 8. Permissive Parents Sacrifice What Matters to Them

Permissive parents make constant compromises about things that are important to them. Examples include:
- Letting their child treat them badly
- Allowing over-indulgence in screen time addictions rather than focusing on schoolwork, even knowing it sabotages academic learning

These compromises make parenting much less rewarding because the parent sacrifices expectations that are important to them and that would actually be beneficial to their child.

### 9. Undermining the Parent-Child Relationship

Permissive parenting damages the parent-child relationship through multiple pathways:

**Trust and connection suffer**: When children can't trust that parents will help them with the full range of their emotions, they don't feel connected to the parent.

**Respect deteriorates**: When a child doesn't trust that parents will enforce rules that keep the child healthy and safe (examples: "OK, I guess you don't have to wear your bike helmet if it makes you that unhappy" or "OK, I guess you can spend the night at that party without the parents there"), the child disrespects the parent and becomes more challenging, looking for limits as proof that he's actually loved.

**Resentment builds**: When a child mistreats the parent, naturally the parent gets angry and resentful and becomes less nurturing to the child.

## The Balance Point: Empathic Limits

Strict limit-setting that doesn't offer kids empathy is just as problematic as permissive parenting. The solution is neither permissiveness nor harsh strictness. Kids thrive when limits are set with empathy - combining clear boundaries with understanding and connection.

## Key Takeaways

- Limits are necessary for healthy emotional development
- The goal is empathic limits within a strong parent-child connection
- Without limits, children miss opportunities to develop self-discipline
- Children who never experience disappointment fail to develop emotional resilience
- Permissive parenting ultimately harms both the child's development and the parent-child relationship
- Children actually want and need someone to be in charge of keeping them safe
- The parent's role must be different from the child's role
