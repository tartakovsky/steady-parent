# Five Steps to Get Re-Energized: Combating Parental Depletion Through Daily Inspiration

## The Core Problem: Parental Exhaustion and Depletion

Raising children takes so much out of parents that they often sacrifice most everything else that's important to them. This approach is not sustainable long-term. When parents run dry, two critical failures occur:

1. **They cannot model for their child how to live a meaningful life** - children learn by watching, and a depleted parent demonstrates survival, not thriving
2. **They cannot give their child the emotional generosity every child needs** - if you don't access your own "juicy aliveness," you're depriving yourself first, which means you have nothing left to give

## The Concept of Inspiration as Life Force

**Inspiration literally means "to breathe in"** - to energize your life force. This etymology reveals why connecting to inspiration combats exhaustion: you are literally taking in energy rather than only expending it.

The best way to combat the exhaustion of the daily grind is to connect to your deepest inspiration, your **inner knowing**. This is described as "a loving, playful guide" that reveals only "the next right thing" because "it wants to do life together" (quoting Glennon Doyle).

## Individual Pathways to Inner Springs

Everyone has their own way to tap into those inner springs. Examples of what might energize different people:

- Music that gives voice to your soul
- Being in nature to feel centered
- Deep stillness through meditation or prayer

The key insight: **these pathways are personal and must be discovered individually**. What works for one person may not work for another.

## The Productivity Trap and Why It Fails

It may seem impossible while parenting to find time for something so "unproductive" when children have such big, immediate needs. There's always keeping bills paid and getting dinner on the table.

**The reframe: Parenting is a marathon, not a sprint.** This changes the calculation entirely - what seems like wasted time in a sprint mentality becomes essential maintenance in a marathon framework.

## Step 1: Make a List of What Energizes You

### The Discovery Process

If you don't know what energizes you, sit quietly and ask yourself: **"What would inspire or energize me right now?"** Then:
- Listen for the answers
- Watch for them to show up as you go through your day
- Jot them down on a list titled "What Energizes Me"

### The Surprise of Simplicity

Don't be surprised if what you're drawn to is very simple. **Right now, the grand passions you once had might sound exhausting.** What would most inspire you might be:
- A hot bath with no one touching you
- Sitting in the sun for five minutes in silence

**This is fine and valid.** Listen to what your soul needs now, today. That may well be different next week. The instruction is to start where you are and write whatever comes to you.

### Moving from List to Action

For each item on your list, ask: **How can you work this into your life, even in small ways?**
- Schedule it
- Do it
- Revel in it, even the very small steps
- Appreciate yourself as you enjoy the gift of this experience

**The attention principle: Whatever you pay attention to becomes stronger.** Watch what you need change over time as you attend to yourself. Your needs will evolve as you practice self-attention.

## Step 2: Start Small

### The Scaling-Down Framework

Ask: Is there a way to tap into whatever makes your heart sing, even while your child is young? The pattern is to identify your larger passion, then find a scaled-down version that fits current constraints.

### Concrete Examples with Their Adaptations

| Grand Passion | Scaled-Down Version | Why It Works |
|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Write the great American novel | Write in a journal every day while child naps | You enjoy the act of writing itself |
| Perform at a nightclub | Practice once a month with other musicians | Maintains connection to music and community |
| Start a restaurant | Cook together with your children | Incorporates passion for food into existing life |
| Become a parenting coach | Take a course with a forum to participate in | Builds experience and knowledge for later |

**The key insight: You're not abandoning your dreams, you're finding the essence of what you love and accessing it in a form that fits your current life.**

---

## Step 3: Go for Process, Not Product

### The Fundamental Reframe

**The point isn't adding something to your list, but replenishing yourself.** Forget about being productive. What matters is:
- Creativity
- Discovery
- Communing with your deepest inspiration
- Getting your juices flowing
- Connecting to something more vast

### The Practical Implementation

This takes time, but for today, start small:
1. Get your kids occupied with something
2. Set your timer for five minutes
3. Sit quietly and tap into that deep reservoir of creativity that replenishes you

**This might just mean sitting in silence in your living room.** The instruction is to "listen to the song your heart sings when it's full." Over time, follow where that song takes you.

## Step 4: Create Healthy Habits That Will Energize You

### The Two-Layer System

In addition to whatever lights your fire (passion-based energizers), think about what healthy habits would energize your body, mind, and soul. These foundational habits give you more inner resource to take steps toward what inspires you.

### The Automation Principle

How can you work these habits into an already-overflowing life? **The only easy answer is to make them part of your routine.**

The key insight: **If you have to remember to do something, you won't do it most of the time. If it's attached to an existing routine, you'll do it automatically.**

### Examples of Habit Stacking

| Habit | Attached Routine | Why It Works |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| Taking vitamins | With breakfast every morning | Automatic, no decision required |
| Writing in journal | While child does homework, or while nursing baby | Uses existing time slot |
| Guided meditation | Before sleep each night | Bonus: helps with sleep quality |

## Step 5: Work What Energizes You Into Your Daily Life

### The Daily Scheduling Imperative

**Schedule in a tiny bit of what energizes you, every single day.** You may have to let other things drop off your list. That's okay.

### The Trade-Off Reframe

Example given: You'll have more energy to tackle the laundry on the weekend if you keep yourself inspired daily.

**Perspective shift offered: "Your child would rather wear wrinkled clothes right out of the laundry basket than have a depleted parent."**

### The Weighing Question

For each chore, ask: **Is this task really as important as you feeling energized and inspired so you can radiate love to those around you?**

This is not about abandoning responsibility - it's about correctly prioritizing what actually matters most to your family.

---

## The Core Insight: The Feedback Loop

**Balancing your needs with your child's by keeping yourself energized will also give you more great parenting moments, because you'll have more inner resources.**

This is the "Aha! moment" - self-care is not in competition with good parenting; it enables good parenting.

---

## The Philosophy of Small Steps and Inner Guidance

This approach works best in small steps, as you practice listening to your inner guidance. **You don't have to be able to see the end of the path, just to take the next small step.**

The closing question: What small step can you take today?

## Key Quotes Preserved

**Glennon Doyle on inner knowing:**
> "I now take orders only from my inner Knowing... It feels to me like a loving, playful guide, like the reason it will only reveal the next right thing is that it wants me to come back again and again, because it wants to do life together."

**Martha Graham on unique expression:**
> "There is a vitality, a life-force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and be lost."

**Tibetan Proverb on balanced living:**
> "The secret of living well and longer is: eat half, walk double, laugh triple, and love without measure."
