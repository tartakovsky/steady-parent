## The Two-Layer Framework for Emotional Regulation

This article addresses an apparent contradiction in emotional regulation advice: on one hand, we're told to acknowledge and feel our emotions rather than stuffing them; on the other hand, we're told that changing our thoughts can change our emotions. The resolution lies in understanding that these operate at different levels of the emotional process.

### Layer 1: Responding to Emotions Already Present

**Once an emotion has already arisen, the healthiest response is to breathe your way through the feeling without taking action.** You feel the emotion while maintaining awareness of your "calm, compassionate, observing self," and this witnessing process is what heals the emotion. This is how we release upsets and move beyond them rather than having them fester or control our behavior.

This principle applies equally to parenting. When you acknowledge your child's emotions, you help her let them go. Your empathy helps her accept and feel the upset, while your calm compassionate witnessing helps her heal the inner turmoil so she can move on. The parent's calm presence acts as a container that makes it safe to feel difficult feelings.

### Layer 2: Preventing Emotions at the Source

**The source of an emotion is usually a thought** - or a collection of thoughts, which might be called a belief system, viewpoint, or conclusion. Often we aren't even consciously aware of these thoughts and beliefs running in the background.

As we become aware of our thoughts and beliefs, we gain more choice about whether to believe them, and therefore more choice about the emotions they trigger. So while we have no choice but to honor emotions we're already feeling, we can completely sidestep many upsetting emotions by noticing the thoughts that are creating them before they spiral.

**Key insight**: Many parents find themselves repeatedly swamped with upsetting feelings. While it's possible to spend all your time breathing through and releasing these emotions, there's a more efficient approach - go to the source and prevent unnecessary emotions from arising in the first place.

## The Problem: Unexamined Negative Thoughts

Most people aren't aware of how many negative thoughts show up in their minds about their child, their parenting, and themselves. These negative thoughts automatically trigger negative emotions.

### Examples of Negative Thought Patterns

**Example 1 - Sibling conflict:**
- Negative thought: "My son should love his brother and not get so mad at him."
- What's problematic: Contains the rigid expectation ("should") that children won't experience normal human emotions like anger toward people they love

**Example 2 - Tantrums in public:**
- Negative thought: "My toddler has constant tantrums and it's so embarrassing. I'm sure people think I'm a bad mother."
- What's problematic: Contains mind-reading ("I'm sure people think"), catastrophizing ("constant"), shame about normal developmental behavior, and tying self-worth to the child's behavior

**Example 3 - Forgetfulness:**
- Negative thought: "My kid would lose his head if it weren't glued on. Maybe a better punishment would motivate him to remember."
- What's problematic: Contains character judgment (labeling the child as fundamentally forgetful) and an assumption that punishment is the solution

**Example 4 - Self-judgment:**
- Negative thought: "I must be a terrible parent."
- What's problematic: All-or-nothing thinking, global negative self-assessment

**Critical point**: Many of our conclusions aren't even true. We treat these thoughts as facts when they're interpretations filtered through negativity bias.

## The Solution: Reframing to Resist Negativity

Reframing means replacing negative, assumption-laden thoughts with thoughts that are accepting and empowering - and these reframed thoughts have just as much truth to them as the negative versions.

### Reframed Versions of the Same Situations

**Reframe of sibling conflict:**
- New thought: "Everybody gets mad sometimes, even at people they love. It's normal for kids to squabble. Where's that book on sibling rivalry so I can give the boys some help with their feelings?"
- What's different: Normalizes anger, removes rigid expectations, shifts from judgment to problem-solving

**Reframe of tantrums:**
- New thought: "I refuse to be embarrassed by a tantrum. She's allowed to have her feelings. Every parent has lived through this and they're all sympathizing with me right now."
- What's different: Reclaims agency over embarrassment as a choice, affirms child's right to emotions, assumes positive response from others instead of judgment

**Reframe of forgetfulness:**
- New thought: "He does seem to be forgetting things a lot. Is he overwhelmed? Can I help him develop a better system so he'll remember?"
- What's different: Acknowledges the behavior without character judgment, considers underlying causes (overwhelm), moves toward collaborative problem-solving rather than punishment

**Reframe of self-judgment:**
- New thought: "I'm doing the best I can. Two steps forward, one step back still takes me in the right direction. I am more than enough. I love my kids and I'm learning all the time how to regulate my emotions better."
- What's different: Self-compassion, progress orientation rather than perfection orientation, connects effort to identity rather than outcomes to identity

## Key Nuances and Clarifications

### Reframing Still Requires Problem-Solving

**Reframing your thoughts doesn't mean ignoring problems.** The reframed thoughts in the examples still lead to action - looking up resources on sibling rivalry, developing systems for remembering, continuing to learn about emotional regulation. The difference is that you approach problem-solving from a calmer, more optimistic state, which makes it easier to find constructive solutions.

### Why Calmer Thoughts Lead to Better Solutions

When you're flooded with negative emotion, your cognitive flexibility decreases. Choosing thoughts that make you feel calmer and more optimistic is itself a form of emotional regulation. From this regulated state, you have access to more creative problem-solving capacity.

### The Skill Gets Easier with Practice

Reframing to resist negativity isn't easy at first, but it gets easier every time you do it. This is a skill that develops through repetition. Over time, you'll find that it changes the way you experience your world, opening up more positive options that you couldn't see before.

## Core Principle: Perception Shapes Reality

**"We don't see things as they are, we see them as WE are."** - Anais Nin

This quote captures the fundamental insight: our thoughts aren't objective reports on reality. They're filtered through our current mental state, our belief systems, our history. Since we're already interpreting reality through a subjective lens, we might as well choose interpretations that support our wellbeing and effectiveness rather than ones that trigger downward spirals.

The question to ask yourself: Why give negative thoughts the power to send you into a downward spiral? You have the option to change your mind instead.

## Summary of the Two Approaches

| Situation | Appropriate Response |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Emotion already present | Honor it, breathe through it, feel it in the context of your calm observing self, let it heal and release |
| Recurring upsetting emotions | Go to the source - examine the thoughts creating the emotions, notice negative assumptions, reframe to thoughts that are equally true but more accepting and empowering |

Both approaches are valid and necessary. The first is for emotions that have already arisen. The second is for preventing unnecessary emotional flooding by intervening at the thought level before emotions spiral.
