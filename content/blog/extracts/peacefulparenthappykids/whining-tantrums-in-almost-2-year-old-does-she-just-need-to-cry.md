# Understanding Tantrums and Emotional Expression in Toddlers

## Core Framework: Crying as Emotional Processing

**Children need to cry to process emotions.** This is the central insight. Babies and toddlers have huge emotional reactions to things that seem minor to adults (like getting the wrong color cup). They are also completely tuned in to their caregivers, so even slight curtness from a parent can cause them worry. When they turn around and cannot see their parent, they panic.

These big feelings must be expressed. Only when emotions are expressed and met with empathy can children let them go and move on. The implication is that trying to stop the crying short-circuits this natural processing mechanism.

**The "good cry" phenomenon:** Anyone who has been lovingly held while crying deeply can attest to the relief and peacefulness that follow. This same mechanism applies to toddlers. After being allowed to fully cry while held, children often fall asleep or want to cuddle, and their connection with the parent deepens.

## What Happens When Crying Is Suppressed

When parents feel that crying or tantrumming reflects poorly on them as parents (feeling like a "bad mom" for not being able to prevent or stop it), they often try to:

1. **Distract the child** - This sends the message that expressing negative feelings is not okay
2. **Feed them** - This teaches children to overeat to control their feelings
3. **Get angry at them** - This teaches children they must suppress their "yucky feelings" to be loved
4. **Leave them alone to cry** - Same lesson: stuff your feelings if you want to be loved

**The stuffing phenomenon:** Suppressed feelings do not disappear. They get "stuffed" inside and then seep out around the edges, manifesting as:
- Crankiness
- Clinginess
- Excessive nursing or pacifier use
- Rebelliousness
- Anxiety

**Self-soothing displacement behaviors:** When anxiety from pent-up emotions builds, many toddlers develop repetitive habits to zone out and dissociate from their feelings:
- Nail biting or picking
- Hair twirling
- Rocking

These behaviors are signals that a child has emotions they have not been able to process.

## The "Crying in Arms" Technique

**The prescription:** Give the child a chance to really cry any time they need to.

### How to implement:
1. **Hold them and offer comfort** while they cry, but do not try to get them to stop crying
2. **Let them fully express their distress**
3. **Communicate understanding** even if you do not know what caused the meltdown
4. **Welcome the crying** - Reframe it mentally: the child is not "throwing a fit," they are showing you all their pent-up feelings
5. **Do not DO anything** except hold them and listen to what they are "telling" you
6. **If they will not let you hold them**, just stay close
7. **Stay calm** - Breathe and remind yourself (and them) that everyone needs to cry sometimes
8. **Speak soothingly** - Tell them you are there and they are safe

**Critical requirement:** Children must cry in the protection of a parent's arms (or at least their full attention, if the child is tantrumming too hard to be held). They should not cry alone in a crib. They need to let the bad feelings out AND feel empathy and understanding simultaneously.

## The Deeper Message Being Communicated

When children are held while crying, they learn:
- They might not always get what they want, but they get something better: someone who loves all of them, including the "yucky feelings"
- They are more than good enough exactly as they are
- Their feelings are accepted unconditionally

**This message is described as the foundation of all emotional health for children.**

## Expected Outcomes After Implementing This Approach

After being allowed to fully cry while held:
- Better sleep
- More cheerfulness
- Less rebelliousness
- Anxiety symptoms (like nail biting) may resolve
- Strengthened parent-child connection

## Identifying When a Child Needs to Cry

Signs that a toddler may have pent-up emotions needing release:
- Frequent tantrums at small things
- Whiny and clingy behavior
- Sleep difficulties (naps and bedtime becoming huge challenges)
- Anxiety indicators (nail biting/picking, hair twirling, rocking)
- Regression in previously mastered skills (like potty training)

## Specific Guidance on Sleep and Co-sleeping

**It is fine for a toddler to sleep in the parent's bed at this age.** However, if you do not want them there, you send contradictory messages by "giving in" when they protest being put in their own bed. This trains the child that nothing stops them from sleeping with you as long as they are willing to fight about it.

**Binary choice:** Either commit to teaching them to sleep independently (which requires being ready for the process) or just let them sleep in your bed until you are ready to start. Inconsistency creates confusion and conflict.

## Toilet Training Philosophy

**Leave it up to the child.** If they do not want to use the potty, it does not matter. Let them wear diapers or pull-ups.

**Key principle:** Fights about the child's body are fights you can never win.

**Practical note:** A child who was already almost trained will take about one day to complete training once they are ready, but they have to want to do it themselves.

**Age consideration:** Toilet training at almost-2 years old is described as "a bit early," and feeling pressured about it could be a source of anxiety.

## Sources of Anxiety in Toddlers

Potential anxiety triggers to examine:
1. **Potty training pressure** - Especially if started early
2. **Achievement pressure** - Even subtle investment in the child being "precocious" or demonstrating skills/learning can create pressure
3. **Unexpressed emotions** - The core issue being addressed

**What "doing well" means for an almost-2-year-old:** Enjoying exploring and experiencing. Any pressure beyond this can create anxiety.

## Reframing the Parent's Role

The common belief that a "good mom" prevents tantrums or calms them down quickly is counterproductive. This belief:
- Creates pressure on the parent
- Leads to suppression tactics that backfire
- Misses the child's actual need (emotional expression and processing)

**The reframe:** A tantrum is not something to prevent or fix. It is the child showing their pent-up feelings. The parent's job is to be present, accepting, and empathetic while the child processes.
