## Core Premise: Spirituality Is Universal and Independent of Religion

All humans have a spiritual dimension. Teaching children great spiritual lessons does not require belief in a supreme being or adherence to any particular religious tradition. Whether or not you include God in your worldview, children benefit from learning that:

- Life is sacred
- Their choices matter
- Nature deserves reverence
- Their presence in the world contributes to joy and goodness
- Things have a way of working out (though not always as expected)
- The greatest joy usually comes from connecting and sharing with others
- Being uncomfortable can push us to grow
- While we don't always get what we want, we can always choose to make the most of what we get

This article is specifically written for parents who may not follow a structured religious tradition but still want to instill spiritual values in their children.

## Lesson 1: Trust in a Friendly Universe

### The Core Concept

Children need to feel that the universe smiles on them. This is a foundational spiritual lesson that works regardless of religious beliefs. Einstein allegedly said that **the most important decision each person makes is deciding whether or not this is a friendly universe**.

### Why This Matters - The Biological and Social Impact

People who feel safe in the world are more emotionally and physically healthy because **a sense of safety actually changes nervous system function**. Beyond individual health, feeling safe makes people more interested in connecting with others, which in turn increases happiness, helpfulness, and cooperation. The trust creates a positive feedback loop: safety leads to connection, connection leads to more positive experiences, which reinforces the sense of safety.

### Practical Implications

**Protect young children from TV news.** TV news has been proven to make anyone who watches it feel less safe and more likely to over-estimate the chances of threatening occurrences. Young children especially should not be exposed to it because they cannot contextualize what they see.

**Teach safety without undermining general trust.** While children need to learn that some people are not to be trusted, this knowledge should not prevent them from trusting people in general. The goal is age-appropriate caution, not pervasive suspicion.

**Cultivate a deeper level of trust.** Beyond physical safety, Einstein was likely recommending something more profound: a sense that life has meaning and that the good we do in the world matters. This gives children a foundation for finding purpose.

## Lesson 2: Empowerment Over Powerlessness

### The Core Principle

There is always something each one of us can do to make things better. This principle must be actively taught because the alternative - feeling powerless in the face of tragedy or evil - leads children to grow into cynical teens and adults. When children feel empowered to make a difference, they grow strong in their own inner compass about what's right and are more likely to stand up for it.

### The Opportunity in Children's Questions

Life provides many opportunities to help children feel empowered rather than despairing, simply through how we answer their questions. However, parents often miss these opportunities because:

- Children's constant questions can feel like a nuisance when we're busy
- We often don't know how to answer difficult questions
- We're rushing children through schedules and don't pause to engage deeply

### How to Handle Difficult Questions

When children ask hard questions like **"Why would someone shoot other people they don't know?"** - whether they're trying to make sense of the human heart or mysteries of the universe - they are asking for help integrating confusing information into their worldview.

**What's acceptable:**
- Saying you don't know the answer to everything
- Wondering together
- Grieving together
- Searching together for answers

**What's essential to communicate:**
Tragedy does not just fall out of the sky. Even if we cannot see the reason, there are reasons for the things that happen. This helps children maintain trust in a comprehensible world while acknowledging that bad things happen.

**Example response to violence:**
"Sometimes people disagree with each other and they don't use their words to work things out. They fight - with their hands, or guns, or bombs. Those things always create more pain and hurt. That's why we always try to use words."

"And there is always something each one of us can do, in every moment, to make things better. When that tragedy happened, there were so many people who were helping each other to safety. Those are the people I most admire."

This framing accomplishes several things: it explains the behavior without excusing it, connects to the child's own life (using words), and redirects attention to helpers and positive action.

## Lesson 3: Love of Nature

### The Connection Between Nature and Wellbeing

People who feel connected to nature are healthier physically and emotionally. The natural wonder and magic children find in nature may be the beginning of spirituality itself.

### Examples of Natural Wonder

- A spider web glistening with dew
- The rising moon
- A waterfall
- Kittens being born
- A simple green shoot breaking through the earth

Each of these reminds us of the miracle that is life.

### The Enduring Value of Nature Connection

As Rachel Carson said: **"Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts."** This suggests that nature connection is not just pleasant but creates lasting resilience.

## Lesson 4: Gratitude as a Spiritual Practice

### Why Gratitude Works

Gratitude is a time-honored spiritual path that works regardless of your beliefs about the nature of the divine. The benefits are concrete and research-supported:

- Regularly experiencing gratitude makes us happier
- When we're struggling emotionally, gratitude heals
- Gratitude somehow seems to open the door to the life we want
- The deeper our gratitude, the greater our ability to receive, and the more we get out of life

### Teaching Gratitude to Children - What Doesn't Work

Children rarely understand their many blessings naturally. **Guilt is not an effective teacher** for gratitude. Trying to make children feel bad about what they have compared to others backfires.

### What Does Work

**Modeling is the best strategy.** Simply note aloud, frequently, how lucky we are:
- This beautiful day
- This bountiful meal
- This reliable car
- Such a terrific teacher or neighbor
- And, of course, each other

**Information given judiciously** - matter-of-factly, age-appropriate, without guilt:
- "Some kids don't have a back yard to play in like we do, that's why we cherish it and take good care of it."
- "Grandma is getting older and won't be with us forever, so we take advantage of every chance we can to visit her, even though it's sometimes not so interesting for you."

These examples show how to give context without inducing guilt - they explain why we value something rather than shaming children for not appreciating it.

**Regular family habits** serve as place-markers for deeper gratitude children will develop as they mature:
- Grace before meals
- Counting our blessings
- A thank you at bedtime for the wonderful day

### The Fullness of Gratitude

Melody Beattie: "Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow."

## Lesson 5: Silence and Stillness

### The Problem with Background Noise

Many of us use background TV and radio as a way to avoid being alone with ourselves. But there's a stillness at the core of our being that connects us to something greater than our conscious mind.

### Why Children Need Quiet

Children, even more than the rest of us, need quiet time to simply be present with themselves.

**The impact of non-attended voices:** If radio voices that your child is not listening to are intruding on the peacefulness of your home, she has to work to block those voices out, which increases her tension level. And if the voices are talking about issues that are disturbing to your child, the tension escalates further.

**Music is different from talk.** Music is a wonderful part of setting the mood in your house. The distinction is between mood-setting sound and intrusive verbal content that demands cognitive processing even when ignored.

### The Core Message

All of us need silence in our lives. Limiting technology noise allows us to hear the stillness and connect with something deeper.

## Lesson 6: Slowing Down for Wonder

### The Cost of Rushing

Parents often rush children past the wondrous moments of everyday life. The pace of modern life and the pressure of schedules work against experiencing daily miracles.

### Practices for Cultivating Wonder

- Marvel at the sun glittering on the snow
- Stop and smell the roses
- Bless the rainbow

### An Important Caution

**Don't feel you have to turn wonder into a science lesson, reducing the sacred whole to mechanistic parts.** The goal is not to explain but to appreciate. Simply notice that daily life is full of miracles, and appreciate them together with your child.

## Lesson 7: Reflection and Inner Listening

### How Reflection Works

Simply sitting non-judgmentally with big questions or the unresolved issues in our heart directs the light of conscious awareness to those challenges, which has a healing effect. At the very least, it usually illuminates the next question or the next step toward gently loosening a tight situation.

### If Your Tradition Includes Prayer

Teach your child to listen as well as to talk while praying. Prayer should be two-directional, not just requests to the divine.

### Universal Practices for All Families

Whether you regularly pray or not, all families need opportunities to sit quietly together, soaking in the wonder of life:
- Walks in the woods
- Looking up at the moon
- A car ride on a sun-warmed morning

These are not religious activities but universal human needs for reflection and presence.

## Lesson 8: Take Ownership of Your Child's Religious Education

### The Core Warning

Don't assume religious educators are teaching your child what you think matters spiritually. You as a parent are responsible for your own interpretation and implementation of your religion.

### A Concrete Example of Problematic Teaching

One parent's daughter interpreted what she was taught in religious school about the Abraham and Isaac bible story as meaning that if you think God is telling you to kill someone, you need to do it. This demonstrates how religious stories, taught without parental context and guidance, can be interpreted in harmful ways by children.

### Two Levels of Responsibility

**1. Know what your child is being taught** by religious educators. Help them interpret it in a healthy way rather than assuming the teaching is complete or correct as delivered.

**2. Take responsibility for how you implement your religion with your child.** Example: All children feel sexual feelings. For them to grow up with a positive body image, we need to avoid shaming them about those feelings, regardless of what religious leaders may say.

### The Bottom Line

No matter what your religion is, don't assume that those teaching it have a more direct line to divine guidance than you do. Parents have both the right and responsibility to shape their children's spiritual understanding.

## Lesson 9: You Can Do Hard Things

### The Principle

Kids need to understand that most things that are worth doing are hard. This is both a practical life skill and a spiritual lesson about growth and character.

### Why Discomfort Matters

Most of us avoid discomfort, but being uncomfortable often pushes us to learn, grow, and develop. Discomfort is the engine of growth, not something to be eliminated.

### The Moral Dimension

Most moral choices cost us - that's why they're moral choices. If doing the right thing were always easy and convenient, it wouldn't require character. Understanding this helps children see that difficulty is not a reason to avoid right action.

### What to Model

Show your child how to figure out what support you need and give it to yourself, so you can be your best self and be proud of your actions. The message is not "suffer alone" but "prepare yourself to handle difficulty."

## Lesson 10: The Joy of Contributing

### The Universal Need

All of us have a need to contribute, and that's usually where we find our greatest joy. This is true for children as well as adults.

### Addressing Injustice

Children (and the rest of us) often find it puzzling that the world is so unjust. Whatever your religious beliefs, you probably want your kids to know that the angels - literally or figuratively - need our help. We are the agents of positive change in the world.

### The Benefits of Contributing

The pride of contributing to the betterment of society:
- Makes us happier
- Makes our children happier
- Makes the world a better place

### Two Levels of Good Citizenship to Model

**Personal level:** Volunteering, helping a stranger who drops their groceries on the street - individual acts of kindness and service.

**Community level:** Participation in democracy, including managing conflict peacefully - engagement with larger social structures and processes.

### The Parent's Job

Find ways for your kids to make a positive difference in the world so they can enjoy and learn from this experience. Don't just tell them contributing matters - give them opportunities to experience it.

### The Shelter Story

A person looked at all the caged animals in the shelter - the cast-offs of human society. They saw in their eyes love and hope, fear and dread, sadness and betrayal. They were angry. "God," they said, "this is terrible! Why don't you do something?" God was silent for a moment and then spoke softly. "I have done something," He replied. "I created You." -Jim Willis

This story captures the essence of Lesson 10: the answer to "why doesn't someone do something?" is that we are that someone. Our very existence is the response to the world's needs.
