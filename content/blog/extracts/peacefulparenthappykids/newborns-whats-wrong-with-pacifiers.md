## Core Position: Pacifiers Are Acceptable for Some Babies

The central stance is non-dogmatic: a "natural mama" can consider using a pacifier because **every baby is different**. Some babies have very strong comfort sucking needs that go beyond what breastfeeding alone provides. Even many breastfed-on-demand babies still suck their thumbs or fingers, and some infants begin sucking their thumb or fingers in utero, coming out ready to find their thumbs immediately after birth.

The argument against being dogmatic is that rigid judgment does a disservice to parents. The reality is that individual babies vary significantly in their need for non-nutritive sucking, and acknowledging this variation is more helpful than prescriptive rules.

## The SIDS Controversy: AAP Recommendation vs. Breastfeeding Experts

### The AAP Position

The American Academy of Pediatrics released a recommendation that babies be given pacifiers at naptime and bedtime through the first year of life because studies show pacifiers decrease the risk of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).

The recommendation includes an important caveat: **pacifiers should not be introduced until after one month of age in breastfeeding infants**. The reasoning is that by one month, nursing is presumably well established and the pacifier won't cause nipple confusion.

### Why Pacifiers Might Cause Nipple Confusion

The artificial nipples of both bottles and pacifiers are easier for a baby to latch onto than breast nipples. This ease of latching can undermine an infant's ability to correctly latch onto the breast. The consequences of poor latching include:
- Sore nipples for the mother
- Baby frustration and upset that can escalate to refusing to nurse entirely

### The Counter-Argument from Breastfeeding Experts

Many breastfeeding experts challenge the AAP recommendation by pointing out that Mother Nature has already designed a perfect system to protect against SIDS without pacifiers.

**Understanding the SIDS mechanism**: SIDS is thought to result from an infant falling into too deep a sleep before the baby's body has gained the ability to regulate its own arousal. Sucking on a pacifier while sleeping keeps the baby from sleeping as deeply, which guards against SIDS by maintaining higher arousal.

**Natural alternatives that accomplish the same thing**:
- **Waking frequently at night to nurse** keeps the baby at higher arousal levels
- **Sleeping near Mama (co-sleeping)** keeps baby's physiology at a higher level of arousal; the baby's sleep cycles even parallel the mother's

Both co-sleeping and breastfeeding have been shown to have a protective effect against SIDS precisely because they keep arousal levels higher. Historical evidence supports this: SIDS was probably unknown before separate bedrooms and cribs were invented. Since 1992, as both co-sleeping and breastfeeding have increased, SIDS rates have decreased.

**Key insight**: For babies who are already breastfeeding, pacifiers do not offer any particular additional benefit against SIDS because the breastfeeding itself is already providing the protective arousal effect.

## Risks of Pacifiers for Breastfeeding

Even after nursing is well established (past the first month), most breastfeeding experts continue to advise against pacifiers because of ongoing risks to milk supply and infant nutrition.

### Milk Supply Depends on Frequent Nursing

Frequent nursing is the best way to create and maintain a good milk supply. This remains a necessity long after the first month - milk supply is not a one-time establishment but an ongoing process that responds to demand.

### Night Feedings Are Nutritionally Critical

**Babies drink approximately 1/3 of their daily food intake during night feedings.** This is a substantial portion of nutrition that happens at night, not during daytime feeding.

Using a pacifier to calm a crying baby at night instead of nursing can lead to:
- **Poor weight gain** in the infant (because they're missing that 1/3 of daily calories)
- **Plugged ducts** for the mother (from insufficient milk removal)
- **Mastitis** for the mother (from milk stasis and plugged ducts)
- **Decrease in milk supply** (because supply responds to demand - less nursing means less milk production)

**Bottom line**: Pacifiers can easily sabotage nursing by replacing feeding sessions with non-nutritive sucking, creating a cascade of problems for both mother and baby.

## Bonding and Emotional Considerations

### The Purpose of Baby's Cry

Bonding experts raise a concern that goes beyond nutrition: **a baby's cry is meant to initiate connection**. When parents use a pacifier to quiet a crying baby, the pacifier may take the place of love and human connection.

### Nursing as Emotional Nurturance

From a bonding perspective, nursing is not just about feeding a baby - it's about **emotional nurturance** and providing comfort. When a baby cries, she needs to be held and comforted, not just quieted.

### Reframing "Using the Breast as a Pacifier"

There's a common concern that babies might be "just using the breast as a pacifier." The natural parenting perspective reframes this entirely: **the breast IS nature's designed source of comfort**. The question to consider is: Which would you rather your baby see as her source of comfort - you, or a piece of plastic?

This reframe positions comfort nursing not as a problem to solve but as the natural design functioning correctly.

## Thumb Sucking vs. Pacifiers: A Detailed Comparison

### Arguments for Thumbs (More Natural)

- Thumbs are more "natural" than pacifiers
- In the middle of the night, a baby can always find his thumb, whereas he almost certainly cannot locate his pacifier by himself
- **Toddlers who suck their thumbs are famously the best sleepers** precisely because they can self-soothe without parental intervention to retrieve a pacifier

### Arguments for Pacifiers (Easier to Wean)

The **one clear way** in which a pacifier trumps a thumb is in ending the habit.

**The pacifier advantage**: The pacifier habit is far easier to break than the thumb habit simply because the pacifier doesn't stay on your child's hand, beckoning. Pacifiers get thrown away, the child mourns, has a tough week, and goes on with her life.

**The thumb challenge**: The siren song of the thumb is always there. This leads to feelings of shame and anxiety as the child tries hard to please her parents, peers, and the dentist by giving up her comfort habit - while the temptation remains literally attached to her body.

### Critical Timing for Both

Neither thumb nor pacifier should be used past the age of five because this is when the arrival of permanent teeth nears. The concern is that continued sucking habits can affect dental development.

## Pacifier Safety: Material Concerns

If considering a pacifier, the material composition is a critical element to evaluate.

### Materials to Avoid

**BPA (Bisphenol A)**: Many pacifiers contain BPAs, though this is predicted to change given recent publicity. BPA is an endocrine disruptor.

**Latex pacifiers**: These leak low levels of **nitrosamines**, which is a known carcinogen. The exposure is ongoing and cumulative during sucking.

**Phthalates**: Some pacifiers are still made with **diisononyl phthalate (DINP)** or **phthalate esters**. These can be released during sterilization, meaning parents may inadvertently increase exposure when trying to keep the pacifier clean.

**Silicone pacifiers**: These were considered safe for a long time but are now highly suspect. The specific concerns are not detailed, but the "safe" classification has been revised.

### The Only Currently Safe Option

**Natursutten's rubber pacifier** is identified as the only safe pacifier on the market. Key features:
- No synthetics or additives
- Made of natural rubber

**Significant drawbacks**:
- Must be replaced every 5-7 weeks to stay safe (per manufacturer instructions)
- This replacement schedule is both costly and inconvenient
- There's always the problem that what's considered safe today might not be considered safe tomorrow

### The Uncertainty Principle

**What's considered safe today might not be considered safe tomorrow.** This is illustrated by the fact that most people hadn't heard of BPAs a few years ago, yet now they're recognized as harmful. The same pattern could repeat with any current material.

This uncertainty about materials strengthens the argument for thumbs, which involve no external materials at all.

## Summary Decision Framework

When deciding whether to use a pacifier:

1. **Assess your baby's individual comfort sucking needs** - some babies simply need more than others
2. **If breastfeeding**, recognize that pacifiers offer no SIDS protection beyond what nursing and co-sleeping already provide
3. **Consider the breastfeeding risks** - night feeding interruption, milk supply reduction, potential for mastitis
4. **Think about the bonding implications** - pacifiers may replace human connection
5. **Weigh thumb vs. pacifier trade-offs** - thumbs are more natural and self-serve but harder to wean; pacifiers are easier to eliminate but come with material safety concerns
6. **If choosing a pacifier**, carefully evaluate material safety and be prepared to replace frequently
7. **Plan for cessation before age five** regardless of which comfort method develops

The final rhetorical question - "On second thought, what's wrong with thumbs?" - suggests that given all the concerns about pacifier materials, the natural option may be the safest choice despite the weaning challenges.
