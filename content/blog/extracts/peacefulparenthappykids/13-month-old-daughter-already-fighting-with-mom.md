# Understanding and Navigating Toddler Power Struggles

## The Developmental Reality Behind "Defiant" Behavior

### What Is Actually Happening

When a toddler arches their body, goes rigid, screams, or physically resists during routine activities like diaper changes or car seat buckling, this is not defiance in the adversarial sense. It is the **beginning of the child asserting herself as a separate person**. As babies become less distractible, they gain more clarity about their own needs and wants, and they try to assert some control over their environment to meet those needs - just as all humans do.

The child cannot talk yet, but she can certainly communicate by physically resisting situations she does not like. She is not trying to get into a fight with the parent. She is trying to express her wants and needs, and to prevent things she does not like from happening to her - like having her body put where she does not want it.

### Why This Is Healthy (Even Though It Is Hard)

This self-assertion is a **healthy, developmentally appropriate stage**. Toddlers do not yet have the neurological development to reason or to control their emotions, as they will begin to do by age three or four. But for the rest of childhood, the child will be developing her own sense of agency, which means stepping into her own power. That is what you want as a parent, and it is your job to facilitate it, so she grows into a person who can stand up for herself.

The child needs to have her own ideas. If she has "big feelings," she will let you know in no uncertain terms when she disagrees with you.

### The Long-Term Stakes of How You Respond

How you navigate these moments of resistance will determine two critical outcomes:

1. **How close you will ultimately be with your child** - The quality of your relationship depends on how these conflicts are handled.

2. **Whether the child becomes "contrary"** - Will she feel a need to resist your authority in a knee-jerk fashion because the two of you have an ongoing power struggle and that is the only way she can assert her own personhood?

## Core Principle: Control Reduces Defiance

**The more control toddlers have over their own lives, the less they need to be defiant.** This is the foundational insight. When children feel they have agency and their preferences matter, they do not need to fight for every scrap of autonomy.

This means the first recommendation is to give the child control whenever possible in her life.

## The Problem with "Not Letting Them Win"

### Why the Win/Lose Frame Is Destructive

The instinct to not "let her win" when she behaves defiantly is understandable but counterproductive. These moments should not be framed as power struggles where someone wins or loses.

**No one wins a power struggle.** It is the parent's job to sidestep power struggles as much as possible.

### The Force Creates Resistance Principle

**Every time you use force with another human being, you create resistance and future power struggles.** If you consistently force your child into her car seat or onto her changing table, she will become more defiant in other areas. The short-term compliance you get through force comes at the cost of increased resistance everywhere else.

## Strategies for Sidestepping Power Struggles

### Strategy 1: Distraction and Engagement (Updated for Smarter Toddlers)

As children become less distractible, old distraction techniques stop working. The solution is to invent new ones that are more engaging.

**Examples:**
- "Which toy should we bring in the car? That one? Okay! Quick, let's get you into your car seat so you can hold it!" - This redirects focus to something the child wants and creates urgency around cooperation.
- If the child likes music, put her favorite music on loud in the car before putting her in the seat, and dance her into her car seat.
- If the child can have juice or snacks in the car, give them to her first, then put her in while she is holding and focusing on her snack.

This approach takes effort. Parenting a toddler will stretch your creativity. But it is worth it because it keeps power struggles from becoming a pattern and actually strengthens the relationship, which helps the child want to cooperate.

### Strategy 2: Parenting Aikido - Go With Their Need for Control

**Parenting Aikido** is the practice of going with the child's need for control while still meeting the parent's need to keep things safe.

**How it works:** Give the child the power to choose between two choices that are both acceptable to you.

**Example:** "We have to get in the car now. Do you want to climb in yourself?" (you may have to assist) "Or do you want me to put you in?"

This preserves the child's sense of agency while accomplishing the necessary task.

### Strategy 3: Remove Yourself from the Authority Position

Instead of being the source of rules and therefore the target of rebellion, position yourself as someone who is also subject to the rules and empathizes with the child's frustration.

**The shift:** Instead of "Because I said so," you say "The rule is" and express empathy that you are sorry, you did not make the rule.

**Example for external rules:** "I'm so sorry, I know you don't want to ride in the car seat, but the rule is kids have to ride in car seats. That's the rule for all kids. But guess what? You get to have candied ginger in the car seat to keep your tummy settled, and it's a very short ride to the store."

**Example for internal rules:** "At bedtime everyone brushes their teeth. See? Mommy does it too. That's the rule."

**Why this works:** Distancing yourself from being the source of the rule removes the child's need to rebel against you. You become the empathizer instead of the heavy. Your child feels you are on her side so she is more likely to cooperate rather than fight with you.

### Strategy 4: Join Rather Than Command

**Shift from "You do this" to "Let's" and "We."**

Saying "Let's get you into your car seat" instead of "Get in your car seat" creates a sense of partnership rather than hierarchy. The more you can frame activities as something you are doing together, the better.

### Strategy 5: Playfulness as Cooperation Tool

Most toddlers cannot resist an invitation to play. When a child resists, playfulness will often gain her cooperation. This is not manipulation - it is meeting the child where she is developmentally and making cooperation feel good rather than like submission.

## Reframing the Child's Behavior: Assume Communication, Not Combat

### The Principle of Charitable Interpretation

Instead of assuming the child is wrong or just picking a fight, assume that she is trying to tell you something the only way she knows how.

**Concrete example:** A child who fights the car seat may be getting carsick. Some solutions that have worked for previously car seat-hating children:
- Trying a different car seat (some children find one unbearable but love another)
- Opening the window
- Using a motion sickness-preventing wristband
- Snacking on candied ginger (which helps with nausea)

### Practical Application: The Diaper Change Example

A 13-month-old who refuses to lie down for diaper changes is not being defiant for no reason. She has a strong personality, she loves walking, and she is busy all the time doing something else that she does not want to stop doing.

**Solution:** Change her standing up for routine changes. For poopy diapers, explain that it is just too messy and she has to lie down, and it usually works. But for routine changes, there is no reason to force her to lie down. She is not a baby anymore. Who cares what position she is in?

**Additional insight from practice:** Cold wipes can cause the resistance. In cold climates, the sensation of cold wet wipes on sensitive skin is genuinely unpleasant. The child's resistance may be to the unpleasant experience rather than to the parent personally.

## When You Must Impose Limits

### Acknowledging the Reality

There will be times when you have to impose a limit: "We need to get in the car right now because I have to go to work, and the rule is kids have to ride in car seats."

You may, in those cases, not get the cooperation you want even when you give choices, because kids, like the rest of us, respond badly to pressure.

### How to Impose Limits Without Creating More Resistance

When you must impose your limit:
1. Go ahead and do it
2. **Remember that she does not have to like it**
3. Offer empathy: "I know, you don't want to get in the car seat, but the rule is kids ride in car seats and we do have to go, I'm sorry."

**Key insight:** Empathy lessens resistance. Once the child feels like you are on her side and not fighting with her, she is more likely to comply without escalating.

## The Distinction Between Asserting Preferences and Challenging Authority

It is okay for kids to assert their preferences and express their feelings. This is not a challenge to the parents' authority. Or at least it will not be, if you let them assert their will to some degree.

**That is what any self-respecting person needs to do.** The goal is not to raise a child who never disagrees or never expresses displeasure. The goal is to raise a person who can stand up for herself while also being able to cooperate and navigate relationships.

## Building the Foundation for Cooperation

### Relationship Quality Determines Cooperation

The better your relationship with your child, the more she will want to please you. Therefore, continue to build a strong, close relationship. Lots of snuggling and connecting goes a long way in bridging disagreements.

### The Single Parent Context

Being a single parent is tiring, and fighting with your child is exhausting and confusing. However, having a loving relationship with your child and being able to spend much of your time with her provides a strong foundation to build on.

A child may seem to fight more with the primary parent than with others (like daycare providers). This does not mean the child respects the parent less - it means the child feels safe enough to express her true feelings and needs.

---

## Intergenerational Patterns

**A historically defiant and contrary relationship between parent and child can be passed down.** Parents who had difficult, defiant relationships with their own parents often worry about repeating those patterns.

**The antidote:** Seeing things from the child's point of view, making the child feel understood. What would the parent-child relationship have been like if the parent had felt understood?

The gift you give your child by responding with empathy rather than force is also a gift you give yourself - breaking the cycle of adversarial parent-child dynamics.

## Practical Tips for Cold Climate Diaper Changes

Several alternatives to commercial baby wipes that avoid the cold wipe problem:

1. **Cheap washcloths:** Run under warm water and squeeze out before the change. Toss in the wash after. Works for non-poopy changes.

2. **Viva paper towels with warm water from a pump thermos:** Fill the thermos every morning and the water stays warm. Add a few drops of baby oil to the water. The paper towels are very soft, almost like cloth. No diaper rash from chemicals in commercial wipes.

3. **Flannel squares:** Softer than washcloths. Cut 24 squares from cheap flannel. Wet in the sink before diaper change or use warm water from a thermos filled each morning. Toss in a bucket and wash with regular laundry. The soap and chemicals in commercial wipes are not necessary to clean up a poopy diaper and in fact they irritate sensitive baby skin.

## Evidence of Effectiveness

**Parent reports after implementing these strategies:**

- "My daughter has not been fighting me! Like some kind of magic it just works. I've gotten her into her car seat successfully already several times."

- "It is amazing how much my attitude changes my son's behavior. If I make an effort to empathize with him, he is so much more cooperative."

- "It does take an effort - after all, I have a lot to do and I don't always want to take the time. But I find it is worth it to avoid the tantrums and fussing. He is much better behaved now, and other people even comment on it."

The effort required is real, but the payoff in reduced conflict and improved behavior is substantial and noticed by others.
