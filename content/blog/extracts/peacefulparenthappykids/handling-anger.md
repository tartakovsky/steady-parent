# Handling Parental Anger: A Complete Framework

Source: Peaceful Parent Happy Kids - "When You Get Angry At Your Child"

## Core Principle: Your Child's Behavior Doesn't Cause Your Anger

The foundational insight is that no matter how aggravating a child's behavior is, that behavior does not cause the parent's angry response. When parents are in a state of well-being, they can often stay patient and empathic even during challenging moments. The determining factor is the parent's internal state, not the child's actions.

When stressed, parents become primed to over-react. The cascade works like this: You see the behavior ("He hit the baby again!") -> You draw a conclusion ("He's going to be a psychopath!") -> This triggers other conclusions ("I've failed as a parent!") -> This cascade creates a runaway train of emotions (fear, dismay, guilt) -> These feelings become unbearable -> The best defense feels like a good offense -> You lash out in anger. The entire process takes about two seconds.

**Any issue that makes you feel like lashing out has roots in your own early years.** The evidence for this is that parents lose their ability to think clearly in those moments and start acting like children themselves, throwing their own tantrums.

This is normal. All parents enter the parenting relationship wounded in some way from their childhoods, and children surface all those wounds. Parents should expect their kids to act out in ways that send them over the cliff sometimes. That's precisely why it's the adult's responsibility to stay away from the cliff.

## Why Parents Get So Angry at Their Children

### The "Ghosts in the Nursery" Phenomenon

Parents and children have the ability to trigger each other like no one else can. Even as adults, people are often irrational in relation to their own parents. (Who has greater power to annoy you and make you act childish - even now - than your own mother or father?)

Psychologists call this phenomenon **"ghosts in the nursery"** - children stimulate the intense feelings of their parents' own childhoods. Parents respond to their children by unconsciously re-enacting a past that's etched like forgotten hieroglyphics deep in their psyches. The fears and rage of childhood are powerful and can overwhelm people even as adults. Laying these ghosts to rest can be enormously challenging.

### Children as Safe Targets

Children are an easy target for frustration with life's many challenges, compared to adults who might respond in kind (partners, bosses). As Anne Lamott said: "One reason I think we get so angry mad at our children is because we can. Who else can you talk to like this?"

## What Happens to Your Child When You Scream or Hit

### The Child's Perspective Exercise

Imagine your spouse or partner losing their temper and screaming at you. Now imagine them three times as big as you, towering over you. Imagine that you depend on that person completely for your food, shelter, safety, protection. Imagine they are your primary source of love and self-confidence and information about the world, that you have nowhere else to turn. Now take whatever feelings you have summoned up and magnify them by a factor of 1000. That is something like what happens inside your child when you get angry at them.

### Escalating Harm by Type

- **Anger alone** is scary enough
- **Name calling or verbal abuse** (speaking disrespectfully, blaming, ridiculing) takes a higher toll on the child's self-esteem, since the child depends on the parent for their very sense of self
- **Physical violence including spanking** has been proven to exhibit lasting negative effects that reach into every corner of adult life: lowered IQ, stormier relationships, higher likelihood of substance abuse

### Warning Sign: When Children Don't Fear Parental Anger

If a young child does not seem afraid of a parent's anger, it indicates they have seen too much of it and have developed defenses against it - and against the parent. The unfortunate result is a child who is less likely to want to behave to please the parent and is more open to influences of the peer group. This means repair work is needed.

**Whether or not they show it - and the more often parents get angry, the more defended children will be, and therefore less likely to show it - parental anger is nothing short of terrifying to children.**

## The Physiology of Anger

When in "fight or flight" mode, the child starts to look like the enemy. Hormones and neurotransmitters flood the body, causing:
- Muscles to tense
- Pulse to race
- Breathing to quicken

It's impossible to stay calm at those points. The body is physically ready to fight.

## The Most Important Rule About Anger

**The most important thing to remember about anger is NOT to act while you're angry.**

You'll feel an urgent need to act, to teach your child a lesson. But that's your anger talking. It thinks this is an emergency. It almost never is. You can teach your child later, and it will be the lesson you actually want to teach. Your child isn't going anywhere. You know where she lives.

## The "Never Do" List

Commit now to these absolutes:
- **No hitting**
- **No swearing**
- **No calling your child names**
- **No meting out any punishment while angry**
- **No screaming at your children** (that's a tantrum)

If you really need to scream, go into your car with the windows rolled up and scream where no one can hear. Don't use words, because those make you angrier. Just scream.

## The Double Gift of Modeling

Children get angry too, so finding constructive ways to deal with your anger is a double gift to them: you not only don't hurt them, you offer them a role model. Your child will certainly see you angry from time to time, and how you handle those situations teaches children a lot.

**What you might teach (negatively):**
- Might makes right
- Parents have tantrums too
- Screaming is how adults handle conflict

If so, they'll adopt these behaviors as a badge of how grown-up they are.

**What you could teach instead:**
- Anger is part of being human
- Learning to manage anger responsibly is part of becoming mature

## The 15-Point Framework for Handling Parental Anger

### 1. Set Limits BEFORE You Get Angry

Often when parents get angry at their children, it's because they haven't set a limit, and something is grating on them. **The minute you start getting angry, it's a signal to do something** - not yell, but intervene in a positive way to prevent more of whatever behavior is irritating you.

**If the irritation is coming from you** (you've had a hard day, their natural exuberance is wearing on you): Explain this to your children and ask them to be considerate and keep the behavior in check, at least for now.

**If the children are doing something increasingly annoying** (playing a game where someone might get hurt, stalling when asked to do something, squabbling while you're on the phone): You may need to interrupt what you're doing, restate your expectation, and redirect them, to keep the situation and your anger from escalating.

### 2. Calm Yourself Down BEFORE You Take Action

When you feel angry, you need a path back to regulation. The **"Stop, Drop, and Breathe"** technique:
- **Stop** - pause whatever you're doing
- **Drop** your agenda, just for a minute
- **Breathe** - that deep breath is your pause button; it gives you a choice

Ask yourself: Do you really want to get hijacked by those emotions?

**Additional calming techniques:**
- Remind yourself it isn't an emergency
- Shake the tension out of your hands
- Take ten more deep breaths
- Try to find a way to laugh (discharges tension and shifts the mood)
- Even forcing yourself to smile sends a message to your nervous system that there's no emergency
- If you need to make a noise, hum
- Put on music and dance to physically discharge energy

**Building Capacity:**
If you can find 15 minutes a day for a mindfulness practice while kids are in school or napping, you can actually build neural capacity so it's easier to calm yourself in moments of upset. But even daily life with children provides plenty of opportunities to practice, and every time you resist acting while angry, you rewire your brain for more self-control.

### Why NOT to Clobber a Pillow

Some people follow the advice to clobber a pillow, but:
1. If done in front of children, watching you clobber that pillow can be scary. The child knows perfectly well that the pillow is a stand-in for their head, and the image of crazy hitting mommy will be seared into their memory.
2. Research suggests that hitting something - anything - confirms to your body that this is an emergency and you should stay in "fight or flight." It may "discharge" energy and wear you out, but it doesn't get to the feelings driving the anger and may actually make you more angry.

### The Better Alternative: Feel the Feelings Underneath

If you can breathe deeply and tolerate the angry feelings, you will probably notice that right under the anger is fear, sadness, disappointment. Let yourself feel those feelings by noticing the sensations they cause in your body. Don't reinforce them by "thinking" about why you're upset; just breathe into that tension in your body and watch it change and fade. The anger will melt away.

### 3. Take Five

An angry state is a terrible starting place to intervene in any situation. Give yourself a timeout and come back when you're able to be calm.

**Move away from your child physically** so you won't be tempted to reach out and touch him violently. Say, as calmly as you can:

> "I am too mad right now to talk about this. I am going to take a timeout and calm down."

**Exiting does not let your child win.** It impresses upon them just how serious the infraction is, and it models self-control. Use this time to calm yourself, not to work yourself into a further frenzy about how right you are.

**If your child is old enough** to be left for a moment, go into the bathroom, splash water on your face, and do some breathing.

**If your child is young enough to feel abandoned when you leave,** they will follow you screaming. (Even many adult partners will do this.) In this case, walk to the kitchen sink and run your hands under the water. Then, sit on the couch near your child for a few minutes, breathing deeply and saying a mantra that restores your calm:

**Calming Mantras:**
- "This is not an emergency."
- "Kids need love most when they deserve it least."
- "He's acting out because he needs my help with his big feelings."
- "Only love today."

It's fine to say your mantra aloud. It's good role modeling for your kids to see you handle your big emotions responsibly. Don't be surprised if your child picks up your mantra and starts to use it when he's angry.

### 4. Listen to Your Anger Rather Than Acting on It

Anger, like other feelings, is as much a given as our arms and legs. What we're responsible for is what we choose to do with it.

**Anger often has a valuable lesson for us,** but acting while angry, except in rare situations requiring self-defense, is rarely constructive, because we make choices that we would never make from a rational state.

**The constructive approach:**
1. Limit your expression of anger
2. Find a pathway back to self-regulation by soothing yourself
3. When you calm down, use anger diagnostically: What is so wrong in your life that you feel furious, and what do you need to do to change the situation?

**What the diagnostic might reveal:**
- You need to enforce rules before things get out of hand
- You need to start putting children to bed half an hour earlier
- You need to do repair work on your relationship with your child so they stop treating you rudely
- Your anger is actually at your partner who is not acting as a full partner in parenting
- Your anger is at your boss
- You're carrying around anger you don't understand that spills out onto your kids, and you need to seek help through counseling or a parents' support group

### 5. Remember That "Expressing" Your Anger to Your Child Can Reinforce and Escalate It

Despite the popular idea that we need to "express" our anger so it doesn't eat away at us, **there's nothing constructive about expressing anger "at" another person.**

Research shows that expressing anger while angry actually makes you more angry. This makes the other person hurt and afraid, so they get more angry. Instead of solving anything, this deepens the rift in the relationship.

**Expressing anger isn't truly being authentic.** Anger is an attack on the other person because you feel so upset inside. True authenticity would be expressing the hurt or fear giving rise to the anger - which you might do with a partner. But with your child, your job is to manage your own emotions, not to put them on your child, so you need to be more measured.

**The answer:** Soothe yourself first so you can shift out of "protection mode." Then consider what the deeper "message" of the anger is, before you make decisions about what to say and do.

### 6. WAIT Before Disciplining

Is your heart still racing? Make it a point NEVER to act while angry. That will always cause more harm, because you're acting from fear and rage instead of love.

**Nothing says you have to issue edicts on the fly.** Simply say something like:

> "You hit your brother after we've talked about how hitting hurts. I need to think about this, and we will talk about it this afternoon. Until then, I expect you to be on your best behavior."

Take a ten-minute timeout to calm yourself. Get fresh air and take deep breaths. **Don't rehash the situation in your mind** - that kind of stewing will always make you more angry. Instead, use calming techniques.

If you've taken a ten-minute timeout and still don't feel calm enough to relate constructively, don't hesitate to put the discussion off. Take a soothing shower, work out, make dinner.

> "I want to think about what just happened, and we will talk about it later. In the meantime, I need to make dinner and you need to finish your homework, please."

After dinner, sit down with your child and, if necessary, set firm limits. But you will be more able to listen to their side of it, and to respond with reasonable, enforceable, respectful limits to their behavior.

### 7. Avoid Physical Force, No Matter What

**Statistics:** 85% of adolescents said they had been slapped or spanked by their parents as recently as 2007 (Journal of Psychopathology, 2007).

Study after study has proven that spanking and all other physical punishment has a negative impact on children's development that lasts throughout life. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends strongly against it.

**Hypothesis about wider impact:** The epidemic of anxiety and depression among adults in our culture may be caused in part by the aftermath of so many people having grown up with adults who hurt them. Many parents minimize the physical violence they suffered because the emotional pain is too great to acknowledge. But repressing the pain suffered in childhood just makes parents more likely to hit their own children.

**Why spanking is particularly problematic:**
- It may make you feel better temporarily because it discharges your rage, but it is bad for your child
- It ultimately sabotages everything positive you do as a parent
- Spanking, and even slapping, has a way of escalating
- There's evidence that spanking is addictive for the parent because it gives a way to discharge upset and feel better

**There are better ways for you to feel better that don't hurt your child.**

**If you can't control yourself** and end up resorting to physical force:
1. Apologize to your child
2. Tell them that hitting is never ok
3. Seek support - counseling or a parenting course

### 8. Avoid Threats

Threats made while you're angry will always be unreasonable. Since threats are only effective if you're willing to follow through on them, they undermine your authority and make it less likely that your kids will follow the rules next time.

**Instead:** Tell your child you need to think about an appropriate response to this infraction of the rules. The suspense will be worse than hearing a string of threats they know you won't enforce.

### 9. Monitor Your Tone and Word Choice

Research shows that the more calmly we speak, the more calm we feel, and the more calmly others respond to us.

Use of swear words or other highly charged words makes both the speaker and listener more upset, and the situation escalates.

**We have the power to calm or upset ourselves and the person we are speaking with by our own tone of voice and choice of words.**

### 10. Still Angry? Look Beneath It

Don't get attached to your anger. Once you've listened to it and made appropriate changes, let go of it.

If that isn't working, remember that **anger is always a defense.** It shields us from feeling vulnerable.

**To get rid of anger,** look at the hurt or fear under the anger. Maybe your son's tantrums scare you, or your daughter's so obsessed with her friends that she's dismissive of the family, which hurts you.

Once you accept those underlying emotions and let yourself feel them, your anger will dissipate. And you'll be more able to intervene constructively with your child to solve what seemed like an insurmountable problem.

### 11. Make and Post a List of Acceptable Ways to Handle Anger

Sometime when things at your house are calm, talk to your kids about acceptable ways to handle anger:
- Is it ever okay to hit someone?
- Is it okay to throw things?
- Is it okay to yell?

**Since you're the role model, the rules that apply to your child also apply to you.**

Make a list together of acceptable ways to handle anger, and post it on your refrigerator where everyone can read it regularly. Let your kids see you check it as you start to get mad.

**Example list items:**
- "Tell the other person what you want without attacking them."
- "Put on music and dance out your angries."
- "When you want to hit, clap your hands around your own body and hold yourself."

### 12. Choose Your Battles

Every negative interaction with your child uses up valuable relationship capital.

Focus on what matters, such as the way your child treats other humans. In the larger scheme of things, their jacket on the floor may drive you crazy, but it isn't worth putting your relationship bank account in the red over.

**Key insight:** The more positive and connected your relationship with your child is, the more likely they are to follow your direction.

### 13. Consider That You're Part of the Problem

If you're open to emotional growth, your child will always show you where you need to work on yourself. If you're not, it's hard to be a peaceful parent, because everything will trigger you to act your worst.

In every interaction with your child, you have the power to calm or to escalate the situation. Your child may be acting in ways that aggravate you, but you are not a helpless victim.

**Take responsibility to manage your own emotions first:**
- Start with self-care so you have more inner resources
- Be compassionate to yourself - feeling worse won't help you do better

**Your child may not become a little angel overnight, but you'll be amazed to see how much less angry your child acts once you learn to stay calm in the face of their anger.**

### 14. Keep Looking for Effective Discipline Methods

There are hugely more effective ways to discipline than anger. Research shows that disciplining with anger sets up a cycle that encourages misbehavior.

**The alternative approach (that some parents are surprised exists):**
Some families never use punishment, consequences, or timeouts, and parental yelling is infrequent. Limits are set, and there are expectations for behavior, but these are enforced through:
- The parent-child connection
- Helping children with the needs and upsets that drive their "bad" behavior

**The formula:** Parents set clear, calm, reasonable expectations and give children the support to meet those expectations. They create a feeling of safety, which settles their kids' nervous systems so the kids feel, and act, better. The parents model emotional generosity and self-regulation.

The research is clear that these families produce children who are more emotionally intelligent and thus more able to manage their behavior.

### 15. If You're Often Struggling with Anger, Reach Out for Help

Don't try to carry it alone. Professional support (counseling, parenting courses, support groups) can help address the underlying issues.

## Key Frameworks and Concepts Summary

**The Anger Cascade:** Behavior -> Conclusion -> More conclusions -> Emotional flood -> Unbearable feelings -> Lash out (happens in ~2 seconds)

**Ghosts in the Nursery:** Children stimulate intense feelings from the parent's own childhood, causing unconscious re-enactment of the past

**Stop, Drop, and Breathe:** Pause technique to regain choice before reacting

**Anger as Defense:** Anger always shields us from feeling vulnerable; the real emotions underneath are hurt, fear, sadness, disappointment

**Relationship Bank Account:** Every negative interaction withdraws from relationship capital; positive connection increases a child's willingness to follow guidance

**The Double Gift:** Managing your anger both protects your child AND teaches them how to manage their own anger

**Discipline Without Punishment:** Setting clear, calm expectations + connection + helping with underlying needs = emotionally intelligent children who can manage their behavior
