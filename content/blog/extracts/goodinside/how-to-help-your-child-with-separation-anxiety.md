# How to Help Your Child With Separation Anxiety

Source: Good Inside (Dr. Becky Kennedy, Clinical Psychologist)

## Core Reframe: Why Separation Anxiety Exists

Children are biologically attuned to themes of change and separation because their survival depends on it. Kids need parents more than they need food, shelter, or water because parents are the people who provide all of those things plus love and connection. Moments that seem small to adults (school drop off, leaving for work, date night) can feel enormous to a child who has abandonment and loneliness fears operating in the background.

**Critical insight**: Having separation anxiety does not mean you should avoid separating from your child. Quite the opposite: separation is healthy and important for children. The goal is learning how to separate in a way that gives both child and parent the skills they need.

## Understanding Separation Anxiety

**Definition**: Feelings of worry and discomfort children experience when they must spend time away from a parent.

**Age range**: Most common from 9 months through 4 or 5 years old, though having a stage of separation anxiety after age 5 is perfectly normal.

**What it means**: Separation anxiety is not a sign that anything is wrong with your child. It only means your child needs help feeling more comfortable in your absence. Separation anxiety is a normal part of child development.

## The Psychology Behind Separation Distress

A parent's presence makes children feel safe. Therefore, a parent's separation or absence leads to feeling vulnerable.

**The central assessment children make**: In moments of separation, more than anything else, your child is assessing whether you believe they are safe in your absence.

**What children need from parents during separation**:
1. To feel your sturdiness when they are having a hard time
2. To feel that you can tolerate their tears and their fears
3. To feel that you can empathize with their feelings
4. To see that you do not get sucked into the vortex of their feelings

## Strategy 1: Introduce New Caregivers and Environments Gradually

**Anti-pattern**: Dropping your child off at daycare and immediately zooming away.

**Better approach**: Stay present with your child as they explore a new environment and meet caregivers. This lessens your child's sense of fear that accompanies separation.

**The mechanism**: By staying present as your child gets used to new people and places, you allow your child to absorb the sense of safety they feel with you. This absorbed safety allows them to feel more comfortable separating.

**Example**: Sit in your child's classroom for some time before separating from them. This helps the child prepare for separations and makes them feel less scary.

## Strategy 2: Practice by Starting with Short Separations

**Key principle**: Think of separation as something to work up to with your child rather than something that is all or nothing.

**Why this works**: Short separations are easier for kids than longer ones and allow your child to practice separation while feeling more comfortable with their time away from you.

**Example sequence for leaving a child with a grandparent for the first time**:
1. First take a long bathroom break in a separate room
2. Then take a private phone call in a separate room
3. Then leave them alone with the grandparent for an hour

**Benefit**: This builds mastery when separating from you.

## Strategy 3: Let Your Child Take a Toy or Blanket from Home

**Concept**: Transitional objects are items that help your child transition from a familiar environment to a less familiar one.

**Why they help**: Transitional objects help children feel safer in separation and provide a sense of connection to their parent during separation.

**Types of transitional objects**:
- A lovie
- A favorite toy
- A picture of their parent (serves as a concrete reminder of their parent's presence)
- Anything that helps a child feel connected to their parent

**Benefit**: Transitional objects and pictures help buffer the intense emotions kids can feel after saying goodbye.

## Strategy 4: Keep Goodbyes Quick and Positive

**Best practice**: The best separation routines and goodbyes are short and confident.

**Why lingering backfires**: When parents linger, children believe that parents don't feel safe with separation, which only makes the child more anxious.

**Important distinction**: Short does not mean rushed. There is a difference between short and rushed.

**Anti-pattern**: Slipping away without saying something. Children do not want to be left suddenly.

**Requirement**: Always let your child know that separation is happening rather than leaving without warning.

**Preparation tip**: Practice a script to use if your child cries at separation. This helps you go into the separation moment feeling empowered and ready.

**Essential message regardless of words used**: Assure your child that you will return to get them.

## Strategy 5: Tell Your Child When You Will Be Back and What You Will Do Afterward

**Principle**: Confusion always makes anxiety worse for kids while clarity helps kids feel safer.

**Two components to communicate**:

1. **Reassurance of return**: Telling your child that you will be back reassures them that they are safe and their time away from their parent is not permanent.

2. **What happens after pickup**: Children benefit from hearing what you will do with them after you pick them up.

**Example scripts**:
- "After school, we will go home together"
- "After I pick you up, we will get a snack together"

**Benefit of separation done well**: It helps kids develop feelings of confidence and independence.

## Strategy 6: Support Reunion with Positive Attention and Story Telling

**Overlooked insight**: Most parents focus on saying goodbye, but how you approach reunion has a huge impact on a kid's anxiety and on their self-esteem.

**Greeting at pickup**: Greet your child with excitement. Example: "I am so happy to see you."

**The "Tell the Story" technique**: Walk through how separation went, what happened next, and how you came back and came together again.

**Example script**: "I took you to daycare, you were a little nervous to say goodbye, I knew you would be safe, you played with friends, and I came back just like I said I would!"

**Purpose**: Telling the Story is a separation tool that helps your child feel safe and confident during separation by creating a narrative of predictability and return.

## The Parent Experience

It makes sense that parents feel anxious too. It can be hard to say goodbye and hard to see your kid upset.

**What helps parents**:
- Connecting with your child about their feelings around separation
- Establishing routines a child can rely on
- Learning a step-by-step game plan to reduce separation anxiety

**Why parents struggle**: Most parents do not know how to manage separation anxiety or build a child's confidence simply because these things are not natural to know. Unlike other jobs, parenting does not come with training or a manual.

## The Concept of Sturdiness

**Parent's role**: Be the sturdy leader your child needs.

**What sturdiness looks like**:
- Tolerating your child's tears and fears
- Empathizing with their feelings
- Not getting sucked into the vortex of their feelings
- Projecting confidence that they will be safe in your absence

Children read their parent's emotional state to determine whether separation is safe. A sturdy parent signals safety.
