# Understanding Your Deeply Feeling Kid

Source: Good Inside

## Core Definition and Framework

A **Deeply Feeling Kid (DFK)** is a child who demonstrates heightened sensitivity to their surroundings. This manifests in three primary ways: they experience emotions more intensely than typical children, their emotions persist longer than in other children, and they are more likely to resist assistance when struggling. This framework is not a clinical diagnosis but rather an understanding lens that helps parents recognize and respond appropriately to their child's needs.

These children are described as "the most misunderstood group of kids in the world." While parenting them presents real challenges, they also offer profound lessons because they perceive the world deeply, know their preferences clearly, and resist external pressure. The key insight is that nothing is wrong with these children or with their parents' abilities. Child-rearing is not one-size-fits-all, and highly sensitive children require fundamentally different approaches because conventional parenting strategies often prove inadequate or actively counterproductive.

## Common Signs and Behaviors

Several indicators suggest a child may be a Deeply Feeling Kid:

**Emotional Intensity and Expression**
The child overreacts to minor events and earns labels like "dramatic" or "difficult." They display aggressive behaviors including screaming, crying, yelling, hitting, or kicking. Once upset, they struggle to calm down, potentially remaining dysregulated for hours.

**Relationship Patterns During Distress**
The child pushes parents away precisely when they need them most, using phrases like "Leave me alone!" They resist conversations about emotions and feelings. They assign blame unfairly to others, saying things like "You're the reason I failed that test!"

**General Characteristics**
The child displays hypervigilance regarding details. They express strong opinions and struggle with change. Every child differs, and some may exhibit only several of these traits rather than all.

**Important Clarification on Diagnoses**
If a child has diagnoses of ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, pathological demand avoidance, or sensory issues, the Deeply Feeling Kid framework and approach can still provide valuable help. These are not mutually exclusive categories.

## Two Foundational Concepts

Understanding why Deeply Feeling Kids behave the way they do requires grasping two essential concepts: emotional regulation and attachment. A fundamental principle guides all intervention with these children: parents must understand before intervening. This is especially critical with highly sensitive children.

### Emotional Regulation

**Definition**
Emotional regulation means managing feelings constructively. It encompasses three specific skills: identifying emotions, communicating feelings, and coping with distress.

**The Difficult Truth About Children**
Children arrive in the world with all their emotions but "none of the skills to manage those feelings." When children act uncontrollably, they feel uncontrollable. This distinction matters enormously because their behavior does not mean they are "bad," "rude," "dramatic," or "defiant." They simply lack the skills to manage what they are experiencing.

**The Parent's Role**
Parents should view themselves as their child's emotional regulation coach. The parental role involves teaching the missing skills that will foster confident, resilient, compassionate adults. A Deeply Feeling Kid experiences more intense emotions than peers, so they naturally need additional time and support to learn regulation. This is similar to how some children require extra help learning reading or swimming. The encouraging truth is that with proper strategies, "they can and will learn."

### Attachment

**Definition**
Attachment represents the emotional connection between two people. In parenting contexts, attachment constitutes a child's primary evolutionary drive and determines how children develop feelings of safety.

**The Evolutionary Basis**
Young children depend on proximity to caregivers for basic needs (food, shelter, water) and survival. Children constantly monitor their environment, noticing what strengthens and weakens their connection to caregivers. They instinctively protect their attachment against threats. For early humans, these threats involved predators. For Deeply Feeling Kids, the perceived "threats" are their own intense emotions.

**The Paradox of Emotions as Threats**
Two truths coexist simultaneously. First, emotions are not genuinely life-threatening for the child. Second, these emotions feel profoundly threatening to them physically. The child fears being overwhelmed by the feeling. At the same time, they fear their emotion could overwhelm their parent, who is their primary attachment figure.

**Why DFKs Push Parents Away**
This explains the counterintuitive behavior where Deeply Feeling Kids push parents away during their worst moments. They are essentially expressing: "My feeling is DANGEROUS! I need help... but what if you cannot handle this feeling either? I am too much for anyone, I am bad!" The pushing away is a protective mechanism rooted in attachment fear, not a genuine desire for isolation.

## Primary Intervention Strategy

### Stay Close But Not Too Close

During dysregulation, a parent's calm, loving presence represents the most powerful parenting tool available. The physical positioning can vary: sitting directly beside the child or being positioned outside their bedroom door both work. What matters is that the presence communicates a specific message: "Your overwhelming, painful, threatening feelings don't frighten me."

**Handling Protest and Rejection**
The child might protest loudly, saying things like "Go away! I hate you!" Parents must understand this reflects the child's fear, not their true wish. Parents should trust that the difficulty will pass and maintain their position.

**The Modeling Effect**
The parent's emotional stability during these moments demonstrates something crucial to the child: that they too can develop regulation skills. By remaining calm in the face of the child's storm, the parent provides a living example of what emotional regulation looks like.

## Key Principles Summary

**Reframe the Child's Identity**
Deeply Feeling Kids are not "bad" kids. They are good kids experiencing emotions more intensely who need different support frameworks than typical children.

**Foundation for Change**
Emotional regulation skills form the foundation for all behavioral change. Without these skills, behavior modification attempts will fail.

**The Power of Presence**
During difficult moments, a parent's calm presence represents their most powerful parenting asset. This is more effective than any technique or intervention during active dysregulation.

**Validation for Parents**
Parents who dedicate time to understanding their child's needs are demonstrating amazing parenting. The effort to learn about and adapt to a Deeply Feeling Kid's needs is itself a sign of parenting strength.
