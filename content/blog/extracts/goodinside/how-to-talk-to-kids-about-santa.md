# How to Talk to Kids About Santa: Complete Framework

Source: Good Inside (Dr. Becky Kennedy, Clinical Psychologist)

## Core Insight: What Santa Really Represents

Santa is one of the few times in a child's life when adults fully join them in fantasy, play, and imagination. This explains why the Santa story feels so enchanting to children and why discovering the "truth" can feel so upsetting.

**The deeper truth**: When children learn Santa is not real, they are not losing Santa. They are losing a connection to their caregiver through the Santa story. The Santa question is fundamentally a connection question.


## Why Children Ask About Santa

Children only ask questions about topics they are already considering. When a child asks "Is Santa real?", this signals they are likely already trying to make sense of the story and are ready for a conversation, even if they are not ready to let go of the magic just yet.

**The question may come with**:
- A twinge of hope
- A sideways look signaling suspicion
- Both belief and doubt coexisting


## The Two-Step Framework for Responding

### Step One: Understand What Is Happening for Your Child

Before responding, recognize that there is more to the question than a simple "yes" or "no." The child is processing something complex about belief, magic, and their relationship with you.

### Step Two: Understand What Is Happening for You

Reflect on your own relationship to Santa before crafting a response. Consider these questions:

**Your childhood relationship to Santa**:
- Was Santa a big part of your childhood?
- How did you experience it?
- What did it feel like when you found out Santa was not real?

**Your family's relationship to play and imagination**:
- How did your family talk about Santa or other mythical figures?
- Did your caregivers play with you?
- What was your relationship to imagination and magic?

**How Santa relates to "goodness" for you**:
- Does Santa represent magic or a way to manage behavior?
- Is "naughty and nice" part of the Santa story for you or your child?

**The guiding principle**: The right response is the response that helps you stay connected to your kid and grounded in your values.


## Three Response Scripts

### Script 1: Wonder With Your Child

**What to say**: "Hmm... seems like you've been thinking hard about Santa. What do you think?"

**Why it works**: This validates your child's curiosity and creates space to explore what is on their mind underneath the question. You let them lead the way toward the answer they want.

### Script 2: Get Curious About What "Real" Means

**What to say**: "Real... well, what do you mean by real? Real in that Santa makes Christmas feel fun and magical and special? Real as in 'There's one person who lives in the North Pole and delivers presents'? Or real as in a story that we love and want to believe in?"

**Why it works**: This opens up a conversation instead of giving a quick "yes" or "no" and helps your child figure out what "real" means to them.

### Script 3: Make Room for Honesty

**What to say**: "Anytime you ask me a question, I will do my best to give you a truthful answer. Before I answer, I want to make sure that's what you want from me right now."

**Why it works**: Some kids will say "Yes, tell me!" while others will say they want to talk about it later. The latter response is their way of sharing that they are not quite ready for the truth yet.


## Handling Related Tricky Situations

### When Your Child Asks "Do You Believe in Santa?"

**What the child is really asking**: "Can I believe in Santa even if you don't?"

**Response approach**: Share that your beliefs are not the only answer; they are just yours.

**What to say**: "It's tricky. I love the magic and story of Santa, and I believe those feelings are real. And I don't believe that Santa as a person is real. Everyone gets to choose what they believe in."

### When Your Child Asks "So Who Delivered All Those Presents?"

**What the child is processing**: They are trying to figure out what is going on, and more practically, whether losing Santa means losing presents.

**Response approach**: Validate the curiosity and give a direct, loving answer.

**What to say**: "I did, sweetie, I love to give you presents."

### When Your Child Asks About Siblings or Friends Knowing

**Question example**: "Does my sister, brother, or friend know that Santa isn't real?"

**Response approach for siblings**: Connect with your child who knows the truth around helping them not "ruin it" for their sibling.

**What to say**: "One of my favorite things about our family is that we allow ourselves to have our own beliefs. I'm thinking about your sister. She still has fun believing in Santa. Hmm... tricky. What do you think we should do?"

**The deeper teaching**: Collaborating with your child about solutions helps them feel connected to you through play and imagination, only now it is about creating holiday magic for their friends or siblings.


## The "Am I Lying?" Question

**Framework**: There is a world between lying and the truth: play.

**Understanding play**: Play is how kids learn about the world and make sense of what is happening around them. Playing with your kids supports their healthy development.

**Practical guidance**: While there are always exceptions, if your child is interested in the make-believe story, give yourself full permission to enter into the story with them.


## When Your Child Gets Upset and Accuses You of Lying

**What to understand**: When kids are upset about the truth, it is often not about losing Santa. It is about losing a connection to you through the Santa story.

**Response approach**: Validate their feelings.

**What to say**: "It sounds like you wish you'd known the difference between the magic and the reality sooner. I hear that."


## Keeping Holiday Magic Alive After the Truth

**Approach**: Work as a team with your child.

**What to say**: "How can we together keep the magic alive? What might we do over the next couple of weeks to make Christmas feel special?"


## Three Key Takeaways

1. **Why children are enchanted by Santa**: It is one of the few times where adults join them in play and imagination.

2. **You do not have to give a yes or no answer**: You can wonder with your child and let them lead the way toward the answer they want.

3. **The Santa conversation is really a connection conversation**: However you answer, what matters most is that your child feels safe coming to you with big questions.


## Broader Application

This approach applies to all kinds of childhood myths and characters, including the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and more. The same principles of connection, play, imagination, and meeting children where they are remain central.
