## Core Philosophy: Why Self-Care Matters for Parents

**The Paradox of Caregiving**

Life as a parent of young kids is exhausting. Between managing tantrums, cleaning up messes, and constant caregiving, parents feel they have no time or energy for themselves. Yet this truth remains: **the best way to take care of your family is to make sure you are engaging in self-care.**

**Reframing Self-Care**

Self-care is not selfish. Self-care is self-sustaining. It is how you show up as the best version of yourself. It demonstrates to your children that healthy relationships do not require self-sacrifice.

**The Empty Tank Problem**

No parent can be expected to take care of others if their tank is on empty all the time. When this happens, parents become reactive, resentful, and angry. A lack of self-care is a prime reason for **mom rage**, stress, and burnout. Parents who do not carve out time for their own needs are chronically overwhelmed and on edge.

## Defining Self-Care

Self-care is the practice of honoring your own wants and needs. It means carving out time and space in your calendar for periods when you are not caregiving others but rather caregiving yourself.

**The First Step**

The first step in practicing self-care is acknowledging that self-care is something you deserve.

## The Problem with Selfless Parenting

If self-care is hard for you or if you struggle to feel like you deserve it, you have likely internalized the idea of **"selfless parenting."** This concept is counterproductive because:

- Kids need sturdy leaders, not selfless martyrs
- Selfless parenting does not help anyone
- Parents who sacrifice everything cannot model healthy boundaries for children

## Building the Self-Care Muscle

You can think of self-care like any other muscle. There are ways to actively practice taking up space and prioritizing yourself. Each time you do, it becomes easier.

## The Documented Benefits of Self-Care

Parents who begin self-care routines start to recognize that self-care is the most powerful way to:

- Reduce yelling at their kids
- Feel closer to their kids
- Start to enjoy more parenting moments

## Eight Self-Care Strategies

### 1. Get Physical (Movement Without Overwhelm)

**Removing the Barrier of Intensity**

Before you worry about starting some major workout routine, take a deep breath. While intense workouts are an option for those who find them fulfilling, for the rest of us, you do not have to commit to a big new exercise plan.

**The Core Principle**

Any body movement, especially if you can do it while off your phone, will help you engage in self-care.

**Why Movement Works**

Moving one's body helps parents:
- Clear their head
- Organize their thoughts
- Generate good feelings in the body

**Low-Barrier Entry Points**

- Stretching for 5 minutes
- Walking around your block for 10 minutes
- A light yoga class

**Making New Routines Stick**

If starting new routines is hard for you, commit to certain days and write them into your calendar. Be specific with entries like:
- "Stretching from 10:00 to 10:05 am on Wednesdays"
- "Walking outside at noon on Mondays"

Being specific and putting things into your calendar makes a new habit much easier to start.

**Hidden Emotional Benefit**

Physical activity can often help parents become more aware of their emotional needs as well. This is a huge benefit.

### 2. Journal Your Journey

**Beyond Surface-Level Writing**

Journaling is a tried-and-true self-care practice and is much more than just jotting down thoughts on paper.

**The Deeper Message of Journaling**

Journaling is a way of telling yourself: **"I matter. My thoughts and feelings matter."** For many people, spending time writing down things that live in your head and your body helps them start to see themselves as valuable and worthy.

**Getting Started with Prompts**

Prompts can help you begin:
- "What happened today?"
- "What am I feeling grateful for?"

**Mantra-Based Prompts**

You can also use mantras as prompts:
- "I am worthy"
- "I am allowed to have all of my feelings and thoughts"

**The Outcome**

With these prompts, journaling helps parents recognize their wants and needs, which is critical for self-care.

### 3. Pamper Yourself (With a Critical Caveat)

**The Traditional Recommendation and Its Limitations**

Traditional self-care recommendations include pedicures and baths. Many parents find that these activities actually do not feel restorative.

**The Insight That Matters**

Self-care is only effective if it gives you the experience or set of feelings you are looking for. This requires understanding what is missing in your life:

- **If feeling taken care of is what you feel is missing**, pampering yourself may be exactly what you need
- **If feeling connected to other adults is what you feel is missing**, pampering yourself will not help

**Expanding the Definition of Pampering**

Pampering yourself is not limited to being in a spa. It could mean:
- Enjoying quiet time before bed
- Throwing on a soft blanket and lighting a candle in your home

### 4. Reach Out to Friends

**What This Form of Self-Care Provides**

For many parents, a key form of self-care is reaching out to friends and finding opportunities to:
- Decompress
- Vent
- Gain perspective
- Talk about non-child related topics

**Addressing the Guilt**

If you feel guilty spending time with friends, remember this: **Good parents spend time away from their kids.**

**Why This Matters for Children**

It is important for kids to see that parents can take care of them AND take care of themselves. This helps kids see that parenthood does not mean a loss of oneself.

**The Deepening Relationship Benefit**

Many parents find that talking openly with friends about the "selfless parenting" concept and their struggles around self-care leads to:
- A deepening relationship with friends
- Feeling less alone
- Feeling more supported

**The Two Truths Mantra**

Remind yourself: **"Two things are true: I'm a good parent and I like doing things for myself."**

**Recognizing the Cycle**

If stepping outside your family and prioritizing yourself is hard for you, it is no wonder you feel on edge and reactive all the time. It is no wonder you may have bouts of rage when it all feels too much. You are still a good parent, you love your kids, and you can get the support you need to turn this cycle around.

### 5. Find a New or Tried-and-True Recipe

**The Distinction That Matters**

For many parents, cooking becomes a form of self-care, and this is not about cooking meals for your kids.

**How Cooking Serves as Self-Care**

Cooking can be a way to nourish oneself and prioritize your own needs as you consider recipes from your past or as you make foods that taste delicious and soothing to you.

**Ideas for Self-Nourishing Cooking**

Think about:
- A favorite dessert
- A satisfying soup
- A breakfast item that would take a bit of time and care to make

**Why This Counts as Self-Care**

It is the act of carving out time for something that brings you joy that will "count" as self-care. You will be essentially telling yourself that your wants and needs matter and deserve to be cared for.

### 6. Organize Your Time

**The Hidden Self-Care Value of Organization**

Organization can be a form of self-care. One of the hardest parts of parenting is keeping schedules, logistics, and to-dos in your head.

**Tools That Help**

Many parents find that the following not only make their life easier but feel like a form of self-care:
- Keeping a planner
- Using a wall calendar
- Downloading an app to keep track of everything

**Why This Feels Like Self-Care**

Organization relieves parents of the sudden jolt of "Oh no, did I do that?" stress.

**The Cascading Benefit**

When parents feel more organized and less scattered, it becomes easier to find time for self-care.

### 7. Schedule Time with Yourself

**The Common Pattern**

If you are like most parents, you schedule lots of things for your kid, and then at the end of the week, there are no "time leftovers" for the things you might want to do for yourself.

**The Proactive Solution**

One way around this is to proactively schedule time for yourself into your calendar.

**Removing the "Right Amount" Barrier**

There is no right "amount of time" that needs to be carved out. Pick something that is manageable and doable to you.

**Examples**

- 10 minutes that says "Take a walk"
- 15 minutes that says "Drink my coffee while sitting down"

**The Power of Calendar Entries**

Putting self-care on the calendar helps parents:
- Treat it like any other important appointment
- Say no to requests that come your way

### 8. Ask for Help

**Another Powerful Form of Self-Care**

Reaching out to others for help is another powerful form of self-care.

**The Guilt Barrier (Reframed)**

Many parents say that feeling "guilty" stops them from asking for help. But this uncomfortable feeling likely is not guilt.

**Understanding True Guilt**

Guilt is a feeling we have when we act out of alignment with our values. Most of us do value getting support.

**Differentiating Guilt from "Not Guilt"**

It is critical to differentiate guilt from "not guilt." What parents feel is likely "not guilt," which is a tendency to take on the distress of other people. For example, we worry someone will feel annoyed and we take on that feeling.

**The Permission**

Remember that your needs are valid. It is okay if other people may feel inconvenienced when you ask for help.

## Managing the Discomfort of Self-Care

**The Learning Curve**

Self-care does not have to be overwhelming. Over time it will become much less uncomfortable and anxiety-producing, especially if you:
- Have the right resources to find an approach to self-care that works for you
- Build up coping skills to manage the discomfort that comes along the way

**Normalizing the Internal Resistance**

It is okay if you think "But how do I start?" or "I would feel so guilty!" every time you think about self-care.

**The Approach**

Use a mantra to manage that guilt and remember that you can tolerate your discomfort while you prioritize taking care of yourself.

## The Bigger Picture: Parenting and Identity

Parenting does not have to mean sacrificing your own identity or your own wants and needs. In fact, our kids need us to show up as **sturdy leaders**, and sturdy leaders take self-care very seriously.

## The Good Inside Philosophy

**Valuing the Parent Behind the Parenting**

Good Inside is the only parenting approach that values the parent behind the parenting, meaning you. You matter.

**The Counterintuitive Truth**

The best way to get the best out of your children is actually to become the best version of yourself. That starts with self-care and self-awareness.

**The Promise**

None of this has to be daunting. There are exact, manageable steps to get you to where you want to be.
