# Toddler Tantrums: Managing Big Emotions with Calm and Confidence

**Source:** Good Inside (Dr. Becky Kennedy, Clinical Psychologist)

## Core Principle: Understand Before You Intervene

The foundational philosophy is that parents must understand the nature of tantrums before attempting to intervene. This understanding shapes the entire approach to managing meltdowns.

## Reframing Tantrums: Why They Are Normal and Healthy

**Key insight:** Tantrums are a sign of **emotional dysregulation**, not disobedience.

Toddler tantrums are a normal, healthy part of child development. This framing may seem counterintuitive but carries important implications for how parents respond.

**The biological reality:** Children are born with all the feelings but none of the skills to manage those feelings. When a toddler throws a tantrum, it typically means they want something and cannot have it. The outburst is their way of communicating a message that translates roughly to: "I still know what I want, even when you say no to me! My whole body is showing you how much I want it and how much I hate that I can't have it!" They communicate this through screams, hits, tears, and yells because they lack the verbal capacity for words.

**Why this matters for parenting:** Tantrums signal that kids are learning to navigate their feelings. The developmental work happening during tantrums is essential, not problematic.

## The Three Common Triggers for Toddler Meltdowns

Understanding triggers allows parents to emotionally prepare themselves for outbursts and step in with support before the meltdown occurs. Every child is different; certain situations, feelings, or experiences will be easier for some kids to tolerate than others.

### 1. Overstimulation (Sensory Overload)

Sensory overload significantly contributes to meltdowns. When a child is adjusting to new people, thrown off their usual schedule, or otherwise overwhelmed, their frustration tolerance is understandably lower, which leads to more tantrums. This principle applies equally to adults.

### 2. Difficulty Communicating

Toddlers are still learning how to communicate. This is especially important to remember when tantrums feel irrational to adult logic. When a child cries because their apple is "too crunchy" or the rain is "too wet," the logical adult brain might want to respond: "This doesn't make any sense! Stop making a big deal out of nothing!"

**The reframe:** The child literally does not have the words yet to express how they are feeling. They grasp at whatever words they have available to express that something does not feel good.

### 3. Boundaries and Limits

As toddlers build a sense of independence, it is natural for them to push back against boundaries and limits. This explains why "No!" might suddenly feel like a child's favorite word. This pushback is a normal part of development. Critically, holding boundaries in the face of pushback actually helps establish the child's sense of safety as they explore the world.

## The Parental Role: Preserving Desire While Building Skills

**The core parenting job:** Help children preserve their strong desires while building the skills they need to manage and express their feelings in healthier ways.

### Why Preserving Desire Matters

It is good for children to have desire. Parents cannot encourage subservience and compliance when children are young and then expect confidence and assertiveness when they are older. The capacity to say "no" to peer pressure, express needs to a partner, or ask a boss for a raise in the future depends on developmental experiences happening now during toddlerhood.

**The adult problem this prevents:** Many adults struggle to recognize what they actually want, wondering: "Wait, do I actually care about this? Or am I just doing what everyone else expects of me?" Breaking this cycle for children starts with recognizing that their desires are healthy, including the desire to have ice cream for dinner.

**Critical distinction:** Recognizing desires does not mean fulfilling desires. Recognition and validation are separate from compliance.

## How to Manage Toddler Tantrums: The Two Jobs Framework

**Reframing the parental job during a tantrum:** Your job is NOT to stop the tantrum.

Your job is:
1. Keep yourself calm
2. Keep your child safe

That is all. The tantrum itself will end on its own timeline. Over time, as parents model and build healthy emotional regulation, outbursts will become less frequent and less intense.

### Job 1: Keep Yourself Calm

**Why this matters:** When a toddler acts out of control during a tantrum, it is because they feel out of control. They are essentially saying: "This feeling inside me... it's too much! Please tell me that it's not too much for you."

**The mechanism:** By staying calm, parents show their children that they can handle the child's big feelings. This helps children believe they can handle their feelings too. Staying sturdy and grounded in tough moments models healthy emotional regulation for children.

**Practical technique:** Take a few long, deep breaths and use the self-talk: "Nothing is wrong with my child and nothing is wrong with me. I can cope with this."

### Job 2: Keep Your Child Safe

Setting firm boundaries around dangerous behavior shows the child that the parent will help keep them safe when they feel out of control.

**Level 1: Verbal boundary setting.** Sometimes simply stating the boundary is enough to establish safety. Example script: "You really want that toy and I will not let you throw toys at your friend. You're a good kid having a hard time."

**Level 2: Physical boundary establishment.** Sometimes physical intervention is necessary. Examples include holding a toddler's arms so they cannot throw blocks during a tantrum, or picking the child up and moving them to another room. Example script: "My number one job is to keep you safe, and right now safety means going to another room until your body is calm."

## Script Examples and Language Patterns

**Validating desire while holding boundary:** "You really want that toy and I will not let you throw toys at your friend."

**Separating identity from behavior:** "You're a good kid having a hard time."

**Explaining physical intervention:** "My number one job is to keep you safe, and right now safety means going to another room until your body is calm."

**Self-regulation mantra:** "Nothing is wrong with my child and nothing is wrong with me. I can cope with this."

## Key Takeaways (Summary)

1. Toddler tantrums are a normal, healthy part of child development
2. Recognizing common triggers (overstimulation, communication difficulties, boundaries) helps prepare for and reduce outbursts
3. The parental job during a meltdown is NOT to stop the tantrum but to stay calm and keep the child safe

## Contextual Notes

The article acknowledges that tantrums always seem to happen at the worst moments and in the most inconvenient places (running late with shoes being thrown, screaming in grocery store aisles). Feeling frustrated, helpless, or on the verge of your own meltdown is normal. Managing tantrums is one of the most challenging parts of parenting toddlers. The phrase used: "This feels hard because it is hard."

The approach promises both immediate benefits (reducing outbursts today) and long-term developmental benefits (building emotional regulation skills for years to come).
