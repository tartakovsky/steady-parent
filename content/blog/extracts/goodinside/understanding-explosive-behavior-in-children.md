# Understanding Explosive Behavior in Children

Source: Good Inside (Dr. Becky Kennedy, Clinical Psychologist)

## Core Reframe: The Good Kid Having a Hard Time

The central insight is that explosive behavior signals internal struggle, not character flaws. A child displaying explosive behavior is **a good kid having a hard time, not a bad kid doing bad things**. When parents witness hits, kicks, screams, or destruction, the instinct may be to interpret these as manipulation, attention-seeking, or defiance. Parents may even wonder if they have a "bad kid." This interpretation misses what is actually happening: the child's brain and body are overwhelmed, and when children lack the skills or capacity to regulate their feelings, those feelings emerge as behaviors. This is equally true for adults who lose emotional control.

## Defining Explosive Behavior

**Explosive behavior** is an intense, unexpected emotional or physical outburst. During these moments, a child might cry, use harsh language, or become aggressive toward themselves, others, or their environment. These outbursts are extremely distressing and exhausting for both children and caregivers.

### Indicators of Explosive Behavior

A child may be exhibiting explosive behavior if they:

- Have big reactions to seemingly small frustrations or disappointments
- Escalate quickly and struggle to calm down
- Yell, scream, curse, or insult themselves and others when upset
- Hit, kick, bite, spit, or become physically aggressive when upset
- Throw objects or destroy the space around them when upset

### The Parental Experience

Parents dealing with explosive behavior often find themselves hesitating to make playdates out of worry the child might lash out at friends. They brace themselves for everyday errands, knowing a quick grocery run could turn into an hour-long meltdown in the frozen aisle. At home, parents are surprised by how seemingly small triggers (the wrong cup, a spelling mistake) can send the child spiraling.

The unpredictability and difficulty of prevention take a real toll on parents. Many parents cycle through yelling and punishments only to end up feeling guilty or defeated. This is a common experience, and importantly, there are other options beyond these ineffective approaches.

## Root Causes of Explosive Behavior

### Emotional Overwhelm

Children are born with the full range of human feelings but possess none of the skills to manage those feelings. The child is still building skills needed to recognize, manage, and communicate emotions like disappointment and sadness. Because these skills are undeveloped, feelings emerge as hits, kicks, bites, and screams. This is a developmental reality, not a deficiency. The encouraging news is that children can build these skills over time, and there are many ways to strengthen their ability to understand and regulate emotions.

### Physiological or Sensory Triggers

Explosive behavior is not always about big feelings; sometimes it concerns big sensations. When a child takes in many sensations (loud sounds, bright lights, big crowds), the brain can become **overstimulated**. In this overstimulated mode, the child's ability to think clearly decreases while reactivity increases, resulting in hits, screams, and kicks. From the outside, parents know the child is not in a life-or-death situation, but the child's brain does not make that distinction.

### Environmental and Life Stressors

Children rely on routine and familiarity to feel safe. This explains why even minor changes (a different color cup) can throw them off. Larger shifts (moving, changing schools, welcoming a new sibling) disrupt their sense of safety even more substantially. When a child's world feels unpredictable, explosive behavior often serves as communication: "Something feels wrong, and I don't know how to explain it yet."

### Need for Additional Support

Explosive behavior can be part of healthy development, especially in younger children. However, professional consultation (pediatrician, child therapist, or other specialist) is warranted when explosive behavior is:

- Frequent
- Dangerous
- Interfering with the child's daily functioning as they get older

Professionals can help determine whether factors like anxiety, executive dysfunction, or neurodevelopmental differences are contributing to the behavior and can guide families through next steps.

A child may also benefit from a different parenting approach. The **Deeply Feeling Kids (DFKs)** framework is specifically designed for children who feel things more intensely, escalate quickly, and struggle to calm down. DFK is not a diagnosis but rather a way of better understanding and responding to a particular type of child.

## Responding to Explosive Behavior: In the Moment

During an explosive episode, parents should focus on two key steps.

### Step 1: Keep Yourself Calm

When the child is dysregulated, keeping yourself regulated is the first step to helping them learn to calm down. A steady, loving parental presence is a powerful tool in the face of explosive behavior. This presence communicates to the child: "The feelings inside of you that feel so threatening, painful, and scary do not scare me. I can cope with this."

**Practical emotional regulation techniques for parents:**

- Take deep breaths
- Repeat a simple mantra such as:
  - "I can get through this moment."
  - "This won't last forever."
  - "My calm is contagious."

**Normalizing parental struggle:** Difficulty staying calm during explosive moments does not make someone a bad parent; it makes them an overwhelmed parent. Understanding reactivity and learning to reset are skills parents can develop.

### Step 2: Keep Your Child Safe

At the height of explosive moments, the child's brain is not capable of logical processing. The child needs physical and emotional safety.

**Verbal boundary-setting:** Sometimes stating a boundary is sufficient. Example: "You really don't like what I gave you for lunch and I will not let you throw your plate at me. You're a good kid having a hard time."

**Physical boundary-setting:** Other times, parents must physically step in to become the boundary. This might involve:

- Holding the child's legs so they cannot kick during a tantrum
- Picking the child up and moving them to another room

Example script for physical intervention: "My number one job is to keep you safe, and right now that means leaving this room until your body is calm."

## The Concept of Containment

**Containing a child** means setting boundaries to keep them safe during explosive moments. Sometimes words alone are sufficient ("I won't let you hit" or "I won't let you throw blocks"). Other times, physical boundaries are necessary, such as moving the child to another space or blocking their arm from hitting.

## Why Punishment Does Not Work

Punishments address a symptom (the explosive behavior) rather than the underlying problem (the gap between the child's big feelings and their ability to regulate those feelings). Effective alternatives to punishment build the skills the child is missing rather than punishing them for not yet having skills they need. The child does not need to be "fixed"; they need to be understood and helped.

## Building Skills Over Time

The two-step in-the-moment approach (stay calm, keep the child safe) addresses immediate crises. Outside explosive moments, parents can employ other strategies to build emotional regulation skills and reduce explosive behavior over time. The method described will not only improve the child's behavior in the present but will help them build emotional regulation and resilience skills for life.

## When to Seek Professional Evaluation

Parents know their child best. If there is concern about whether explosions are typical development or indicate something more, options include:

- Recognizing the child may be a Deeply Feeling Kid
- Consulting a doctor or professional to explore the possibility of behavior disorders such as:
  - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
  - Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)
  - Conduct Disorder (CD)

## Key Takeaways

1. The child's explosive behavior is a sign of emotional dysregulation. The reframe is essential: "You have a good kid having a hard time, not a bad kid doing bad things."

2. During explosive moments, the parent's job is to keep themselves calm and keep the child safe.

3. Safety can be established by stating a boundary verbally or by physically stepping in when words are not enough.
