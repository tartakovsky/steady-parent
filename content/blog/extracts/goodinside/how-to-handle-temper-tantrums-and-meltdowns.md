# How to Handle Temper Tantrums and Meltdowns

Source: Good Inside (Dr. Becky Kennedy, Clinical Psychologist)

## Core Reframe: Understanding What Tantrums Actually Are

**Tantrums are not a sign of disobedience; they are a sign of dysregulation.** Dysregulation means the inability to manage emotional responses. A tantrum occurs when a child's feelings overpower their ability to manage those feelings.

**Surface behavior versus underlying reality.** On the surface, we see crying, whining, screaming, or flailing. Under the surface, the child is feeling overwhelmed, scared, and out of control.

**The fundamental skills gap.** Kids are born with all of the feelings and none of the skills to manage those feelings. Tantrums happen when there is a big mismatch: a burst of a big feeling without the emotion regulation skills to handle it calmly.

**Developmental normality.** Nothing is wrong with your child if they are having tantrums. Tantrums are a normal part of child development. While most common and intense in toddlers, they still happen with older children.

**The critical mindset shift.** Your child is not giving you a hard time. They are having a hard time. During a tantrum, kids are overwhelmed and need parental help.

## How Tantrums Manifest Differently Across Children

Tantrums look different from kid to kid. Three common presentations:

**Aggression.** For some kids, tantrums bring out hitting, kicking, and throwing items.

**Helplessness.** For other kids, tantrums bring out behaviors like falling on the floor and whining.

**Defiance.** For another group, tantrums bring out running away, laughing, or engaging in destructive behavior.

## The Underlying Emotional Triggers

Tantrums signal that a child is overwhelmed by a distressing emotion. Common trigger emotions include:

- Frustration
- Disappointment
- Anger
- Fear

**Why young children are especially prone.** Young kids are still learning how to communicate, how to understand their emotions, and how to tolerate not getting what they want.

## Common Situational Tantrum Triggers

Parents can become "tantrum detectives" by identifying which moments are hardest for their child and what situations trigger the tantrum state.

**Feeling frustrated.** Working at something and not finding success commonly leads to tantrums.

**Wanting something and not getting it.** When parents say no to a child's request, unmet desires often overflow into a tantrum.

**Being hungry or overtired.** When a child hasn't eaten in a while or is past their naptime or bedtime, tantrums become highly likely.

**Feeling embarrassed in front of other people.** Some kids are prone to tantrums when they feel shame around making a mistake in front of others.

The more you understand about what triggers your child, the more you will be able to provide the support your child needs.

## Prevention Strategy 1: Emotional Vaccination

**Emotional Vaccination** prepares a child for a big-feeling moment, making the child less likely to feel surprised and overwhelmed when it comes.

**How it works.** Before an emotionally challenging event, parents preview what will happen with their child, helping them anticipate and prepare for difficult feelings.

**Examples of when to use it:**
- A parent's upcoming work trip
- A cousin coming by for a playdate

**Dual benefits.** Emotional vaccination reduces tantrums and builds trust and closeness in the parent-child relationship.

## Prevention Strategy 2: Modeling Calm Reactions to Stress

Children learn the most by watching parents. Parents can use this to their benefit by modeling healthy responses to stress.

**The technique.** Narrate your own emotional regulation process out loud during minor frustrations.

**Example script for frustration:** "Ugh so frustrating! Ok let me take a deep breath, I can do this..."

**Example script for difficulty:** "I can't do this! This is so hard! Let me take a breath and take a break... and I can come back to it."

**Why it works.** Modeling regulation in response to stress shows your child what it looks like to handle challenging situations calmly.

## Prevention Strategy 3: Offering Choices to Provide Independence

Children tantrum when they feel out of control. Giving children a small dose of control can stop a tantrum in its tracks.

**The principle.** A child who feels independent and capable is less likely to melt down.

**Critical rule.** Only give options that you approve of.

**Example for getting dressed:** "It's time to get dressed. Do you want to wear this red shirt or this blue shirt?"

**Example for denied purchase:** "Oh we aren't buying this cereal today. Do you want me to take a picture of it or write it down in a note so I can remember it for another time?"

**Why choices feel better.** These moments feel much better to a kid than unilateral communication like only being told "It's time to get dressed" or "We aren't buying this cereal."

## Prevention Strategy 4: Distraction and Redirection (With Caveats)

**When to use.** Distraction and redirection are tools to use sparingly as a way to avoid tantrums.

**Why not to overuse.** We want to teach our kids how to manage feelings, not avoid feelings.

**When it is appropriate.** Distraction and redirection can help a child shift focus and generate more positive emotion in tricky situations. It is also helpful when you are not sure what led to your child's meltdown and you need to act quickly to provide support.

**Example script for screen time ending:** "Oh! Look at this block tower I'm building now... want to help me? I want to make it SO tall."

**The deeper function.** Distraction and redirection, done well, is truly a form of connection, which always helps a kid feel calmer.

## During a Tantrum: The Most Generous Interpretation (MGI)

The first step to dealing with tantrums is accessing your **Most Generous Interpretation (MGI)** of what is happening.

**The practice.** Ask yourself: "What is my Most Generous Interpretation of my child's tantrums?"

**The cognitive shift.** As you practice your MGI muscle, you will think less about your child giving you a hard time and more about your child having a hard time and needing your support.

**The relational reframe.** With an MGI perspective, you see your child as your teammate in need of help, not your enemy in need of punishment.

## During a Tantrum: Validating Feelings (With Technique Refinement)

**Core principle.** Our feelings are not overwhelming as much as feeling alone with our feelings is overwhelming. When you tell your child that you understand their feelings, you remove their aloneness, which almost always helps kids calm down.

**Basic validation.** "You're mad! I know!" This is a common strategy and can be helpful.

**Advanced technique: Validate the Magnitude.** "You're as mad as this whole room, no, this whole house! I know!" Validating the magnitude of a child's feelings is often more effective than basic validation.

**Why magnitude matters.** Showing your child that you understand the size of their feelings is an essential part of being a sturdy leader.

## During a Tantrum: Maintaining Boundaries Firmly

Being a **sturdy leader** involves offering warm validation for feelings and maintaining firm boundaries at the same time.

**What boundaries communicate.** Boundaries show our child that we are not afraid of their feelings. We are willing to hold a line and embrace their feelings, not avoid them.

**The two-way independence principle.** Our kids' feelings do not dictate our boundaries. Our boundaries do not dictate their feelings. These operate independently.

## During a Tantrum: Staying Physically Close

**Safety rationale.** Tantrums can become dangerous to a child and to other people. When a child is having a tantrum, they are not in control of making good decisions, so staying close is important to reduce unintentional harm.

**Anti-pattern: Ignoring tantrums.** Many parents have been taught that tantrums should be "ignored" or that staying present gives a tantrum "positive reinforcement." Nothing could be further from the truth.

**Why ignoring backfires.** Ignoring a tantrum only fuels more tantrums because a child feels alone, misunderstood, and "bad."

**What presence teaches.** Staying near a child is what your child needs to learn how to regulate emotions.

## Scripts for Specific Tantrum Behaviors

**When a child throws toys:** "I won't let you throw toys." Then step between your child and the toy bin so it cannot happen again.

**When a child bangs their head on the floor:** "I won't let you hurt yourself. I'm sitting behind you and stopping you from banging your head."

**Why physical intervention matters.** By staying with your child and preventing harm, you build connection. Your child learns that even in hard moments, you will be there to help them.

**During the hardest moments when words seem unprocessable:** Keep things simple. Say calmly and slowly: "I love you" and "I'm still here." Your child will feel supported instead of isolated during a challenging emotional time.

## The Sturdy Leader Framework

The term **sturdy leader** encapsulates the parent's role during tantrums and emotional moments.

**Two simultaneous qualities:**
1. Warm validation for feelings
2. Firm maintenance of boundaries

**What sturdiness communicates.** The parent is not afraid of the child's feelings. The parent can hold both the child's emotions and the necessary limits without being overwhelmed or punitive.

## Why Parents Struggle With Tantrums

**Lack of modeling.** Most parents don't know how to appropriately manage tantrums because they didn't have anyone in their own life who knew how to handle their overwhelming emotional moments.

**No training.** Unlike other jobs, parenting doesn't come with training or a manual, so feeling overwhelmed is understandable.

**The path forward.** By learning a step-by-step game plan to manage and reduce tantrums, parents start to feel confident, hopeful, and more connected to their child.

## Key Concepts Summary

**Dysregulation:** The inability to manage emotional responses; what tantrums actually represent.

**Emotional Vaccination:** Preparing a child in advance for emotionally challenging moments to reduce surprise and overwhelm.

**Most Generous Interpretation (MGI):** The practice of viewing a child's behavior through the lens of "having a hard time" rather than "giving a hard time."

**Validate the Magnitude:** Going beyond simple validation to acknowledge the full size of a child's emotional experience.

**Sturdy Leader:** A parent who combines warm validation of feelings with firm boundary maintenance without being destabilized by the child's emotions.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Viewing tantrums as disobedience.** Tantrums are dysregulation, not defiance.

**Ignoring tantrums.** This fuels more tantrums by leaving the child feeling alone, misunderstood, and "bad."

**Overusing distraction and redirection.** This teaches feeling avoidance rather than feeling management.

**Unilateral commands without choice.** This removes the child's sense of control and increases tantrum likelihood.

**Letting feelings dictate boundaries.** Boundaries and feelings are independent; warm validation does not require giving in.

**Letting boundaries dictate feelings.** Holding a boundary does not mean the child must stop feeling upset about it.
