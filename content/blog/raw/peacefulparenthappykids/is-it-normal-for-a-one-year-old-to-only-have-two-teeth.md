Question
Dr. Laura,
I have a 1 yr old and he still only has two teeth on the bottom and he shows no other signs of getting more teeth.

Answer
Mollie,  
Don't worry, this is well within the range of normal. There are babies who don't have any teeth at all on their first birthdays. Every child is different. Please check with your pediatrician if you're worried.  
Blessings,  
Dr. Laura
