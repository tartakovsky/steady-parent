_“In many sibling relationships the rate of conflict can be high, but the fun times more than balance it out. This net-positive is what predicts a good relationship later in life. In contrast, siblings who simply ignored each other had less fighting, but their relationship stayed distant long term.” - Po Bronson_

When your children are having a hard time with each other, it can make you want to tear your hair out. And it’s natural to focus on the problem, by trying help them resolve their differences, enforcing household rules (_"Be kind means no name calling!"_), or (understandably) yelling. 
**But here's a game-changer. You might get more mileage out of focusing on creating positive interactions! That's because settling your differences amicably requires goodwill. In other words, your children's incentive to work things out happily with each other depends on how much of a positive balance they’ve built up in their “relationship bank account.”**
How do siblings build up a reservoir of good feelings to draw on? Mostly, by having a good time together. Dr. John Gottman of the Seattle Love Lab has found that couples need five positive interactions to counter-balance one negative interaction. This ratio has been repeated in multiple studies, from couples to workplaces. As far as I know, there hasn’t been parallel research done with siblings. But that’s not a bad ratio to aim for. 
This might make you feel despairing—after all, if your kids fight six times a day, how can you help them create 30 positive interactions every day? Remember that a smile counts as a positive; these don’t all have to be major interactions to have a beneficial effect. Why not simply adopt the goal of helping your children have as many positive interactions as you can? 
Here are 12 tips to help you foster a stronger sibling bond between your children by creating more positive interactions. 
###  1. Notice and promote the activities that get your children playing together. 
Research on improving sibling relationships shows that children have better relationships when they share activities they both enjoy. It can be tough to identify those activities, especially if there’s an age or interest gap. But if you pay attention, you can usually suggest something that will interest both children. For instance, if she wants to play store and he wants to play astronaut, why not have a store on the moon? Or maybe both enjoy the play kitchen, or doing art together, or making forts. Try to encourage at least one shared activity every day. 
###  2. Don’t interrupt happy play. 
You probably remember the old adage _“Never wake a sleeping baby.”_ My corollary is _“Don’t interrupt a happily playing child.”_ So when siblings are playing together well, don’t take it for granted. Support them in whatever way helps them keep playing, and don’t interrupt unless it’s unavoidable. 
###  3. Use oxytocin to get your children bonding. 
Laughing. Dancing together. Singing together. Snuggling. Roughhousing. Include as many oxytocin-inducing activities as you can in your daily routine. 
###  4. Start “Special Time” between your children. 
Designate a daily 15 minute block of time for two children to spend together. Be sure to plan something for them to do that they will both enjoy. This is especially helpful if your children are widely spaced in age, or one is less interested in playing together than the other one, because it structures time together into the regular routine and maintains the connection. 
###  5. When they’re having a bad day, shift the mood by pulling out an activity they’ll both love, 
like making cookies or water play. 
### 6. Include in your bedtime routine a chance for your children to always say "Goodnight" and "I love you" 
to each other. Some families build in bonding rituals like the older child reading to the younger one before bed. 
###  7. Support siblings to nurture each other. 
When one child gets hurt, make it a practice for everyone in the family to stop playing and tend to the child who’s hurt. Hold back a moment to let the siblings step in to nurture each other. Send a child for the ice pack or bandaids, or even let them be your medical assistant and tend to their sibling. Include all the children in this, including any child who was involved in the other getting hurt, so they can begin to feel like a helper instead of a hurter. 
###  8. Instead of pitting your children against each other, find ongoing ways to unite them in the same mission. 
_“Can you work together so you’re both ready for our bedtime story by 7pm? What a team!”_
###  9. Promote the idea of the sibling team 
by creating family activities in which your children work together. For instance, give them a huge sheet of paper to draw on together. Ask them to write a letter to Grandma together. Design a scavenger hunt where the kids help each other, rather than compete against each other. When you roughhouse, always team children against grownups. 
###  10. Put your kids in charge of a project together. 
For instance, maybe they’re in charge of the decorations for Father’s Day, or planning a fun family "picnic" on the living room floor, complete with construction paper butterflies and flowers. Let the children work together to do the planning, with you only peripherally involved to insure safety and maximum fun. 
###  11. Family Kindness Journal. 
Tie sheets of paper together with a ribbon, or just add sheets of paper to a binder. Label it **“Our Family Kindness Journal”** and let the kids decorate it. You might begin with a quote about kindness, such as the Dalai Lama’s: _“Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.”_ Then, notice acts of kindness between your children, and write them in the journal, with the date. 
_“Brody helped Katelyn with her fort when it kept falling down.”_
_“Natalya helped Yuri reach the light switch.”_
_“Jasmine suggested that we buy oranges for Denzel because he loves them.”_
As you talk about the incident, celebrate that kindness has a way of warming the hearts of both people—the giver and the receiver. Soon, your children will be noticing the small kindnesses between them and asking you to record them. Before you know it, they’ll be inspired to more acts of kindness toward each other. 
###  12. Help kids work out problems without making anyone wrong. 
Conflict is part of every human relationship, and children are still learning how to manage their strong emotions. So you can expect your children to fight with each other. Our job as parents is to resist taking sides, which increases sibling rivalry. Instead, teach kids healthy conflict resolution skills, like listening, expressing their own needs without attacking the other person, and looking for win-win solutions.

And of course the most important factor in helping your children get along is for you to forge a strong relationship with each child. When each child knows in his bones that no matter what his sibling gets, there is more than enough for him, sibling love has a chance to bloom. There is ALWAYS more love.
