Question
Hello. I'm 2 months pregnant and I'm spotting. Is that normal or do I have to see a doctor right away? This is my first pregnancy and I'm scared. 
Answer
Frances-  
Please call and see a doctor right away. Things may be completely fine, but your peace of mind is more important. It isn't good for you, or for your baby, for you to be in a panic about spotting.
