> _"We're going camping on vacation and I'd love to have some meaningful family discussions while we hike, but I don't even know where to begin to get the kids to open up and talk."_
* * *
Family vacations are a terrific opportunity to have meaningful discussions. But parents often tell me they don’t know where to begin to have a “real” conversation with their child.  
What if you could ask questions that helped you and your child to connect on a deeper level? What if you could engage your child with interesting topics that they enjoyed and even learned from, without any lecturing? 
You can! You just need to remember three simple things. 
  1. Ask good questions.
  2. Commit to listening and not lecturing.
  3. Enjoy the discussion and stay curious!
These questions will get you started. Rather than badgering your child with them, use one as the jumping off point for a two-way conversation. Start by asking your child the question, and listen to the answer, remembering to reflect back what she’s saying so she knows you understand. 
Don’t shy away from expressing your opinions; kids are often curious what parents think. Just be sure that you listen first, and that you listen more than you talk. 
If you notice that you're feeling a strong need to make a point, take a breath. That usually leads to lecturing, which will make your child tune you out. There's no threat here, and nothing to lose. It's just a conversation, where you practice listening and enjoying your child. Your child is likely to learn some terrific life lessons from discussing these questions, but that's a process of working out their views and understanding themselves better because they have the opportunity to express themselves. The most important take-away for your child will be feeling heard, seen and valued. 
Remember, if you can create enough safety in the conversation, your child may well share something vulnerable. That might scare you. So remind yourself that your goal in these conversations is to connect at a deep level. You don't need to have all the answers. You just have to be present with your child, so they are not all alone with whatever the big thing is that they are sharing with you. If at any point during a conversation with your child you feel anxious, reassure yourself: Stop, Drop Breathe. Then, connect nonverbally, warmly, with your eyes or physically, to provide safety. If you feel a need to respond verbally, you can simply say “I am really glad I know this. Thank you for telling me.” 
One final point: Put all phones away. Research shows that when a phone is in sight, conversations don't get as deep, and may not get started at all.
These Conversation Starter Questions can be adapted for kids of all ages, and work well both to launch family dinner table conversations and for one-on-one time.
