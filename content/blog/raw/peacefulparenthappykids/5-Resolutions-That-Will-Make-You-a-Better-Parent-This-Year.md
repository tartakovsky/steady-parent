Many people don't make New Years Resolutions, because they find themselves making the same resolutions every year. But that doesn't mean you're a failure. It means you're headed in the right direction, and you aren't perfect yet. (Shocking, I know!) 
The bad news is, you won't be perfect this year either. The good news is, you don't have to be! Kids don't need perfection from parents. What they need is parents who accept the child and themselves with all their imperfections, model compassion and respect, and apologize and reconnect when things go wrong -- as they inevitably do. Parents who love themselves as they are, but still want to grow. 
This is tough work, because it's about regulating our own emotions. That's why resolving to be more patient rarely works. By the time we're gritting our teeth to stay "patient" we're already sliding into the stress response of fight or flight. 
But if you want to become a more patient parent – and a happier person – it’s completely possible. Here are 5 simple resolutions to support you in creating a home with less drama and more love. Practicing these is the work of a lifetime, so you still won't be perfect in a year -- in fact, you might make these same resolutions next year! But I guarantee you'll be a more peaceful parent, with a happier, more cooperative child. 
###  1. Resolve to work on regulating your own emotions--by giving yourself more support. 
What if this year, your parenting resolution wasn’t about _trying harder_ — but about having the right support? ❤️ 
That's the only way that you can be the emotionally generous parent you want to be. Start by integrating daily sustainable self-nurturing into your life: Go to bed earlier so you're better rested, eat healthfully to maintain your energy, transform those inner negative comments into encouraging ones, give yourself compassion when you mess up, and slow down your pace so you're not so stressed. 
Most important of all, commit to managing your reactions. When you're in fight or flight, your child looks like the enemy and you can't teach well. Just say No to taking any action while you're angry. 
Does this sound hard? It is. Maybe the hardest thing we ever do. But that urgency to act is a signal that you're in "fight or flight." Calm your own upset before you engage with your child. 
Every time you restrain your own "tantrum" you're rewiring your brain. Each time you choose love, it makes the next choice easier. There's no time like the present to begin. And you'll be astonished at how your child changes, as YOU get better at self-regulating. 
###  2. Resolve to love the one you’re with. 
The one thing we know for certain about child development is that kids who feel loved and cherished thrive. That doesn’t mean kids who ARE loved – plenty of kids whose parents love them don’t thrive. The kids who thrive are the ones who FEEL loved and cherished for exactly who they are. 
Every child is unique, so it takes a different approach for each child to feel safe, seen, and valued. The hard work for us as parents is accepting who our child is, challenges and all – and cherishing him for being that person, even while guiding his behavior. The secret? See it from his perspective, empathize with him, and celebrate every step in the right direction. Maybe most important? Enjoy your child! 
###  3. Resolve to stay connected. 
Kids only cooperate and "follow" our leadership when they feel connected. But separation happens, so we have to repeatedly reconnect. 
Remember that quality time is about connection, not teaching, so it’s mostly unstructured. Hug your child first thing every morning and every time you say goodbye. When you’re reunited later in the day, put your phone away and spend fifteen minutes solely focused on your child. (What do you do in that 15 minutes? Listen, commiserate, hug, roughhouse, laugh, play, empathize, listen some more.) Not enough time? What could be more important?) 
Stop working and turn off your phone and computer before dinner so you can focus on your family. Eat dinner together without screens and do a lot of listening. Have a chat and a warm snuggle at bedtime every night with each child. Laugh as much as you can! 
###  4. Resolve to role model respect. 
Want to raise kids who are considerate and respectful, right through the teen years? Take a deep breath, and speak to them respectfully. After all, kids learn from what we model. If we can't manage our own emotions, we can't expect our kids to learn to manage theirs. Not always easy when you’re angry, so remember your mantras: 
  * _"It's not an emergency."_
  * _"I'm the role model."_
  * _"He's acting like a child because he IS a child."_
  * _"Don’t take it personally."_
  * _"This too shall pass!"_
###  5. Resolve to stay curious about the needs and feelings driving your child’s behavior. 
All "misbehavior" is a red flag that your child needs your help to handle big emotions or fill unmet needs. Once you address the feelings or needs, the behavior changes. If you can lead by loving example, redirect preemptively rather than punish (_“You can throw the ball outside”_), and set limits empathically (_“I see how mad and sad you are. You can tell your sister how you feel without attacking her,”_) you'll raise self-disciplined kids who WANT to follow your guidance. The most important time to stay connected with your child is when she's acting out. 
Sure, your child will make mistakes, and so will you. There are no perfect parents, no perfect children, and no perfect families. But there are families who live in the embrace of great love, where everyone thrives. The only way to create that kind of family is to make daily choices that take you in that direction. It's not magic, just the hard work of constant course correction to get back on track when life inevitably throws you off. 
So don't worry if you're making the same resolutions every year. That just means you're keeping yourself on track by choosing, over and over, to take positive steps in the right direction. Before you know it, you'll find yourself in a whole new landscape. Parenting, after all, is a journey -- not a destination. For today, just choose less drama and more love. You'll be amazed at how far that takes you. 
And if keeping these resolutions sounds like too big a lift, that just means you need more support. This is some of the hardest work anyone ever does. Figure out what you need to give yourself every day, to help you stay on track. Would it help you to have inspiring parenting audios to listen to every day, or a book to read? Would seeing a [parenting coach](https://www.peacefulparenthappykids.com/coaches-directory) or counselor help?

(If you've already taken it, remember that you can re-take it for free!)  
Giving yourself support is not selfish. It's the best gift you could give your family.  
Thank you for all the hard work you do, every day, in your home. I'm honored to accompany you on your parenting journey, and I look forward to supporting you in making 2026 the best year yet for you and your family. May the New Year shower blessings on you and your family.
