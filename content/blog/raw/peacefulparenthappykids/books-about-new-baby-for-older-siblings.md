Lots of fabulous books to prepare big siblings. Many of these will be available at the library, or gently used for low prices online. Or you can snuggle in at a bookstore and read them. But you may want to buy your favorites to read them over and over when times get tough. Many of the books here (especially lower on this list) share the theme of an ambivalent older sibling who comes to love the new arrival, which is a pretty good model to give older kids.
