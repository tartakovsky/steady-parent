## What to Do When Your Toddler Reaches for Something Unsafe
Nothing makes you notice all the tiny, hidden dangers in the world quite like becoming a parent.  
Where others see an adorable table lamp, you see a child-sized weapon of mass destruction. The innocent, and v. v. cute belt you bought? Somehow it’s become a lasso, and you may need to invest in eye protection for everyone. And the outlets in every room? You didn’t realize they were installed with a magnet sensed only by your toddler’s fingers, did you?
(Seriously, though: Did urgent care start issuing punch cards or something?)
Well, if you’ve taken our online course, Winning the Toddler Stage, you know toddlers’ brains are hard-wired for curiosity. They learn by exploring: touching stuff, climbing stuff, picking up stuff, and OMG LICKING and EATING stuff. It’s horrifying and sometimes dangerous, but it’s totes normal.
Our job as parents is to ﬁgure out how we can help our kids discover the world safely. Like, WITHOUT getting on a first-name basis with the ER triage team.
Since wrapping your sweet babe in bubble wrap is not an option (but points for creativity), we’re here to recommend a few practical ways to address unsafe things without losing your mind.  
### Create a “Yes Space”  
One of the best things you can do for your toddler and for your sanity is to create a Yes Space somewhere in your home.
This space is free of “Danger, Will Robinson,” and allows your child to play safely while you relax. In other words? It’s a gift from the gods for both you and your toddler.
Now, we know what you’re thinking. A Yes Space sounds amazeballs, but what do you do when you go to the grandparents’ house or to Target or to the park? Those places can be fraught with unsafe perils.
Keep reading. We got you.
### Staying Calm is the Key, Always  
When you see your child heading down the highway to the danger zone—reaching for a cord or outlet, putting something in their mouths they absolutely shouldn’t, and so on—you’re gonna want to shout, scream, or otherwise make the situation a Very Big Deal™.
Don’t do that.
We know you’re worried about their safety and you’re trying to stop the unsafe behavior as it unfolds before you in slow-motion. But you've gotta resist the urge to freak out, and instead be cool and calm.
Here’s why: Toddlers crave attention. Absolutely lap it up. But their brains aren’t developed enough to distinguish between the kind of attention they’re getting—negative or positive. So whatever you give attention to with your reactions, is what they’re going to continue to do.
If you absolutely freak out when they reach for the cord, they’re going to keep reaching for the cord. Their brain says, “Oooooo! Reaching for the cord means mommy gives me looooootttts of attention. If I keep reaching for it, I’ll keep getting attention. And I loooooove attention!”
As much as we don’t want them to reach for unsafe things, we reaaaaaaaally don’t want them to keep doing it over and over and over again to get our attention.
