Nothing is wrong with your child if they are having tantrums - in fact, tantrums are a normal part of child development. Tantrums are moments when a child’s feelings overpower their ability to manage those feelings. On the surface, we see a kid who is crying, whining, screaming, or flailing but under the surface, a tantrum means that a child is feeling overwhelmed, scared, and out-of-control.

Tantrums can look different from kid to kid. For some kids, tantrums bring out aggression, meaning hits, kicks, throwing items in a room. For other kids, tantrums bring out helplessness - which can look like falling on the floor and whining. For another group of kids, tantrums bring out defiance - meaning running away, laughing, engaging in destructive behavior.

There are many reasons why kids have so many temper tantrums. Tantrums are a sign that a child is overwhelmed by a distressing emotion - like frustration, disappointment, anger, or fear. It’s helpful to think about tantrums this way: kids are born with all of the feelings and none of the skills to manage those feelings. Tantrums are moments where there is a big mismatch - kids have a burst of a big feeling and don't - yet - have the emotion regulation (i.e., management) skills to handle it in a calm way. While tantrums are most common and intense in toddlers, they still happen with older children as well.

Here’s something important to know: tantrums are not a sign of disobedience - rather, tantrums are a sign of dysregulation, which means the inability to manage emotional responses. And this makes sense because young kids are still learning how to communicate, how to understand their emotions, and how to tolerate not getting what they want. So remind yourself that your child is not giving you a hard time (even though it may feel like that!) - they are having a hard time. In other words, during a tantrum, kids are overwhelmed and need parental help.

Here’s some good news: there are things we can do to help children feel calm
  and grounded in emotional moments, and these strategies can stop tantrums
  before they start. With Emotional Vaccination, parents can
  prepare a child for a big-feeling moment, which makes a child less likely to
  feel surprised and overwhelmed when it comes. Emotional vaccination can be
  used to prepare a kid for a parent’s upcoming work trip or a cousin coming by
  for a playdate. Helping our kids prepare in advance for emotional times not
  only reduces tantrums, it also builds trust and closeness in the parent-child
  relationship. Here are three other strategies you can use to prevent tantrums:


### Demonstrate calm reactions to stress

Children learn the most by watching us - and we can use this to our benefit by
  modeling healthy responses to stress in our life. You can struggle to put
  your shoe on and say aloud, “Ugh so frustrating! Ok let me take a deep breath,
  I can do this…” or you can have a hard time with a crossword puzzle and say
  aloud, “I can’t do this! This is so hard! Let me take a breath and take a
  break… and I can come back to it.”
  Modeling regulation in response to stress
  shows your child what it looks like to handle challenging situations calmly.


### Provide your child with a sense of independence by offering choices

Children tantrum when they’re feeling out of control - and so giving children
  a small dose of control is often a way to stop a tantrum in its tracks. Giving
  a child a choice - and remembering to only give options that you approve of! -
  is a great way to help a child feel independent and capable and help yourself
  have a smooth, meltdown-free moment with your kid. Here are some examples:
  “It’s time to get dressed. Do you want to wear this red shirt or this blue
  shirt?” and “Oh we aren’t buying this cereal today. Do you want me to take a
  picture of it or write it down in a note so I can remember it for another
  time?” As you can see, these moments feel much better to a kid than the
  unilateral communication of only being told “It’s time to get dressed” or “We
  aren’t buying this cereal.”


### Distract or redirect your child from the situation

Distraction and redirection are tools to use here and there as a way to avoid
  tantrums - the reason it’s important to not overutilize distraction and
  redirection is that we want to teach our kids how to manage feelings, not
  avoid feelings. Having said that, distraction and redirection can sometimes
  help a child shift focus and generate more positive emotion, which can be very
  helpful in a tricky situation. For example, a child who is having a tantrum
  about screen time ending might need a parent to create a compelling
  alternative for them by saying, “Oh! Look at this block tower I’m building
  now… want to help me? I want to make it SO tall.” In this way, your
  distraction and redirection is truly a form of connection, which always helps
  a kid feel calmer. Plus, shifting your child’s focus can be a helpful strategy
  when you’re not sure what led to your child’s meltdown and you need to act
  quickly to provide support.


### Identify your child’s tantrum triggers

While we can’t stop all tantrums, we can become experts in understanding our
  kid’s triggers for tantrums - and also understanding our own triggers. Think
  of yourself as a tantrum detective - you’re looking to learn about what
  moments are hardest for your kids (and for you!) and what situations trigger
  your child into a tantrum state. The more you understand about what
  triggers your child, the more you will be able to provide the support your
  child needs.

Common tantrum triggers are:

- Feeling frustrated: it’s hard to work at something and not
    find success, and this is a common reason kids have tantrums
- Wanting something and not getting it: when parents say no
    to a child’s request, many children’s unmet desires will overflow into a
    tantrum
- Being hungry or overtired: when your child hasn’t eaten in
    a while or is past their naptime or bedtime, get ready for a tantrum to
    happen
- Feeling embarrassed in front of other people: some kids are
    prone to tantrums when they feel shame around making a mistake in front of
    others

    your child needs - and the sturdy leader we know is inside you!

The first step to dealing with tantrums is accessing your Most Generous Interpretation (MGI) of what’s happening. You can do this by simply asking yourself, “What is my Most Generous Interpretation of my child’s tantrums?” You’ll notice that as you practice your MGI muscle, you’ll think less about your child giving you a hard time and more about your child having a hard time and needing your support. Now that you have an MGI-perspective, you are seeing your child as your teammate in need of help, not your enemy in need of punishment.

Here are some other things you can do during a tantrum:


### Tell your child you understand their feelings

Our feelings aren’t overwhelming as much as feeling alone with our feelings is overwhelming. When you tell your child that you understand their feelings, you are removing their aloneness - and this almost always helps kids calm down. While validating feelings (“You’re mad! I know!”) is a common strategy and can be helpful, it’s often more effective to Validate the Magnitude of a child’s feelings (“You’re as mad as this whole room, no, this whole house! I know!”). Showing your child that you understand how they feel is an essential part of being a sturdy leader for them.


### Be consistent about boundaries

Being a sturdy leader involves offering warm validation for feelings and maintaining firm boundaries at the same time. Boundaries are what show our child that we aren’t afraid of their feelings - because we are willing to hold a line and embrace their feelings, not avoid them. When it comes to setting boundaries and allowing feelings, remember that our kids’ feelings don’t dictate our boundaries and our boundaries don’t dictate their feelings.


### Stay close to your child until the tantrum ends

Tantrums can sometimes become dangerous - to a child and to other people around that child. It’s critical to stay physically close to your child while they are having a tantrum so you can keep everyone safe; after all, when a child is having a tantrum, they’re not in control of making good decisions, so staying close is important to reduce unintentional harm. While many parents have been taught that tantrums should be “ignored” or that staying present is giving a tantrum “positive reinforcement,” nothing could be further from the truth. Staying near a child is what your child needs to learn how to regulate emotions - while ignoring a tantrum only fuels more tantrums because a child feels alone, misunderstood, and “bad.”

There are many scripts you can use to be effective during a tantrum. If a child begins to throw toys during a tantrum, step in with this language: “I won’t let you throw toys” and step between your child and the toy bin so it can’t happen again. If your child begins to bang their head on the floor during a tantrum, step in with this language: “I won’t let you hurt yourself. I’m sitting behind you and stopping you from banging your head.” By staying with your child and preventing harm, you’re building connection with your child - and your child is learning that even in hard moments, you will be there to help them. And during the hardest moments of a tantrum, when it seems like your child can’t really process the words you’re saying, keep things simple like saying calmly and slowly, “I love you” and “I’m still here” - your child will feel supported instead of isolated during a challenging emotional time.

Tantrums are a common part of child development - and still, tantrums are exhausting, challenging, and often overwhelming to parents. Most parents don’t know how to appropriately manage tantrums because they didn’t have anyone in their own life who knew how to handle their overwhelming emotional moments. Plus, unlike in other jobs, parenting doesn’t come with training or a manual, so it’s no wonder so many parents feel overwhelmed. And at the same time, by learning a step-by-step game plan to manage and reduce tantrums, parents start to feel confident and hopeful - and more connected to their kid.
