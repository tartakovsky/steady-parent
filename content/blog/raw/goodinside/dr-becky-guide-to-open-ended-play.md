Playing with children doesn't come naturally to everyone. The Good Inside team partnered with Play-Doh and Walmart to create a free guide demonstrating how unstructured, imaginative play supports child development while strengthening parent-child relationships.

## What is open-ended play?

Open-ended play involves no instructions, goals, winners, or losers—instead emphasizing imagination, curiosity, and presence. Examples include dressing up, pretend play, making art, or shaping Play-Doh. Dr. Kennedy notes that "your relationship to play isn't a barometer for your relationship with your kid."

## Why play matters

Play helps children by:

- **Making sense of the world** through experimenting with ideas, trying new roles, and exploring feelings
- **Building lifelong skills** like frustration tolerance, confidence, and problem-solving
- **Feeling connected** to parents—seen, valued, and loved for being themselves

## 5 Steps to Open-Ended Play

### 1. Explore your experience with play

Reflect on how you played as a child and whether caregivers participated. Modern adult life emphasizes productivity, making present-focused play challenging but achievable.

### 2. Expand your definition

Play requires three elements: being present, engaged, and free to explore. It needn't be elaborate—silly voices, simple shapes, or kitchen dancing all count.

### 3. Schedule play

Even brief, focused playtime fills a child's emotional needs, reducing power struggles. Start with five to fifteen minutes using open-ended materials.

### 4. Put your phone away

"Play No Phone" (PNP) signals children they deserve full attention, preventing split focus that children sense intuitively.

### 5. Follow your child's lead

Resist directing or correcting. Instead, observe silently, narrate their actions descriptively, or mirror their creations.
