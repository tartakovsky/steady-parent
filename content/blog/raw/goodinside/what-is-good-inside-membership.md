- What access will I have to Dr. Becky?
Good Inside helps parents raise confident, resilient kids. Founded by Dr. Becky Kennedy - a clinical psychologist and mom of three named “the millennial parenting whisperer” by TIME - our approach shows families how to solve current challenges (and get ahead of future ones) to create meaningful, lasting change.

Today, millions of families around the world turn to Good Inside for clear, compassionate guidance. We’re more than a parenting class, book, or app. We’re an all-in-one platform for parents to break old patterns, build confidence, and deepen their connection to their kids - and themselves.

The Good Inside approach, developed by Dr. Becky Kennedy, is rooted in the idea that people are inherently good. By focusing on the child behind the behavior and the parent behind the parenting, we help families heal - and bring out the good inside of everyone.

Our approach teaches you how to be a sturdy leader who can effectively hold boundaries while staying connected to their kids. While we’ll help you improve behavior, we also do something bigger: We help you build a stronger, healthier relationship with your child. And while our approach is designed to tackle your biggest parenting challenges, it’s simple to follow: Our app delivers personalized, bite-sized strategies and tools that you can use right away.

- Personalized, daily support: Feeling triggered by your kid’s tantrums? Giving your tween their first phone? We’ve got you covered. You’ll receive daily support tailored to your kid’s age and needs - and it will always take 5 minutes or less.
- Instant answers to any parenting question: Sometimes, you need an answer like… right now. From managing grocery store meltdowns to talking to your kid about death, our chatbot Gigi is just like texting Dr. Becky!
- Exclusive access to virtual events: Join Dr. Becky, along with outside experts, as they dive deeper into popular parenting topics and common challenges - from Triggers to Couples Communication and more.
- On-the-go content: We know you’re busy. Our audio-only feature makes it easy to fit in workshops or videos while you’re commuting, waiting at the doctor’s office, or folding laundry - plus, you can always search or swipe through our library!
We get it: Parenting advice is everywhere. Here’s how we’re different:

- A proven approach built on clinical wisdom, informed by real life. Created by Dr. Becky Kennedy, a clinical psychologist and mom of three, our approach blends professional training with real family experiences. There’s no jargon and no judgment. Just tools you can actually put to use right away - in fact, 95% of parents say they see positive changes in the first three months of membership.
- Grounded in psychological research. Dr. Becky developed the Good Inside approach based on attachment theory, child development, internal family systems, and behavior change.
- Trusted by millions. Good Inside has sparked a global parenting revolution. We have members in more than 170 countries and Dr. Becky has millions of followers across social media. In addition, Dr. Becky’s book, Good Inside, is a #1 New York Times bestseller and her podcast regularly ranks as one of Apple’s top podcasts.
Good Inside is for parents, parents-to-be, grandparents, friends of parents, teachers, clinicians, and anyone interested in raising future generations of confident, resilient kids.

Our groundbreaking membership helps you learn to build self-compassion, emotional regulation, and confidence and, in turn, feel more equipped to wire your children with these same characteristics. You may be coming here for a set of strategies to “fix” your child’s behavior, but you’ll get so much more - including the support of an active community of parents committed to self-reflection and growth.

While most of our content is designed for parenting kids ages 0-18, many of our strategies are relevant for people of all ages! The most powerful part of the Good Inside approach is how it helps you show up as a sturdier person in every area of your life.

You can join Good Inside with a three-month membership or an annual membership. A membership costs $84 USD for 3 months ($28 USD/month) or $279 USD for the year ($23.25/month). Your credit card will be charged quarterly or annually based on the plan you choose.

Sometimes you don’t need a deeper dive. You just need to know what to do and exactly what to say. You’re covered here.
