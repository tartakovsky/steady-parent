The holidays can bring up a lot of mixed feelings for many families. 
You might have grown up experiencing the holidays as a magical time of year filled with memories and traditions you want to recreate for your children. 
Or, you might have grown up with not-so-great memories, and now you want to break cycles and create new traditions and experiences for your children. 
No matter what your holiday experience was like growing up, as you begin to create memories and traditions with your children, remember that what they need most from you during the holiday season (and the rest of the year) is not something you can wrap up and put under the tree. They need to know that you love and care for them. 
This blog will provide you with easy ways to show your child love this holiday season. Whether it’s a tiny moment like a wink while they are playing or taking them out for a special date just the two of you, we want you to feel prepared to shower your child with extra love and connection and create magical memories that they will look back on and cherish throughout their lives. 
## Tiny Moments
When our kids are babies, we shower them with hundreds of tiny kisses every day, and as they get older, it’s easy to forget that they need these tiny moments of connection, too. Instead of tiny kisses, it might look like whispering “I love you,” tiny love notes in their lunch, making their favourite food for dinner, a smile, a wink or simply a thumbs up from across the room. 
These tiny moments are a gift not only for your child but for yourself as well. For your child, the gift of tiny moments shows your child how much you love them. For you, it’s a gift of feeling connected with your child. 
## Tiny Moments You Can Give Your Child This Holiday Season
**Wrap Gifts Together**
Involve them in wrapping presents with you. You can chat while working together, and they may feel valued by being part of the preparation.
**Give Warm Hugs Throughout the Day**
Give lots of hugs, particularly during holiday moments like decorating, meal prep, or gift wrapping. Holding them close, even if just for a few moments, can be very reassuring.
**Wrap Them in a Cozy Blanket**
Offer to wrap them up like a “holiday present” in a cozy blanket or let them sit on your lap for a few moments of warmth and connection. This small act can make them feel safe and loved.
**Thank Them for Being Themselves**
Every now and then, during holiday events, let them know how much you enjoy having them around just as they are. A simple “I’m so glad you’re here with me” or “You make this season brighter” can go a long way.
**Bring Home Their Favorite Snack or Treat**
Surprise them with their favourite snack or treat from the store. It’s a small but thoughtful gesture that shows you were thinking of them.
**Work on a Puzzle or Craft Together**
Choose a puzzle or craft project that you can do side by side. This allows for conversation and focused time while you create something fun together.
**Help Them with a Holiday Project**
If they have something they want to make or do for the holidays—like creating homemade gifts or decorating their room—offer to assist them step-by-step. Your help will make them feel supported and cared for.
**Arrange a Bedtime Surprise with Holiday Decor**
While they’re away or busy, decorate their room with a few festive touches like twinkling lights, a small holiday wreath, or a cozy new blanket. This surprise setup can make bedtime feel special.
**Give Extra Help with Homework or Holiday Projects**
Offer extra assistance with school projects, homework, or holiday-related assignments. They’ll feel appreciated knowing you’re there to help them succeed.
**Create a Holiday Tradition Together**
Choose an activity you do every year just for the two of you. It could be as simple as making hot cocoa together, setting up the decorations, or watching a favourite holiday movie.
**Go Ice Skating or Sledding Together**
Physical activities like ice skating or sledding often involve holding hands or being close for support. This can be a great way to connect while enjoying a fun, active outing.
**Create a Holiday Countdown with Daily Affirmations**
Make an advent-style countdown where each day includes a note with a compliment or words of encouragement. They’ll look forward to reading something positive about themselves every day.
**Start a Holiday Journal Together**
Encourage them to keep a holiday journal where they write down their favourite memories or things they enjoyed. Include pages where you add your own notes of encouragement or love. Spend time together discussing what they write about - they appreciate heart-to-heart conversations with you!
**Make a “Coupon” for a Special Activity Together**
Create a simple coupon they can redeem for something they enjoy, like a “Hot Cocoa Night,” “One Extra Story at Bedtime,” or “30-Minute Game with You.”
**Give Thoughtful, Personalized Gifts**
Choose gifts that reflect their unique interests, hobbies, or favourite things. Whether it’s art supplies, books on topics they love, or a specific toy they’ve had their eye on, they’ll appreciate the thought behind the gift.
During this busy time of year, remember that these moments of connection are what your child will remember most about the holidays. Whether it’s wrapping gifts together or creating a special tradition for just the two of you, tiny moments are one of the best gifts you can give your child.
