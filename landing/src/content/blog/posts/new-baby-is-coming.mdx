## TLDR

- **Start talking about the baby early.** Toddler brains process change through repetition, and nine months of casual mentions beats one dramatic announcement.
- **Give concrete details, not vague reassurances.** Who will watch them during the birth, what the baby will sound like, how feeding works. All of it.
- **Expect them to not be excited.** Fear of replacement is the default reaction. That's normal, not a red flag.
- **Use "your baby" and "our baby" language.** Possessives create belonging. The baby stops being an intruder and becomes a family member your child has a stake in.
- **Build the sibling relationship before birth.** Talking to the belly, choosing names together, and picking out gifts all give your child a role before the baby even arrives.

## Why this conversation is harder than you think

You'd imagine telling your kid they're getting a sibling would be like telling them they're going to Disneyland. Surprise. It's more like telling them a stranger is moving into their bedroom permanently.

**Your child has had exclusive access to you since birth. The new baby, from their perspective, is someone who will take that away.** That's not dramatic. That's their accurate reading of the situation. They will share your lap, your bedtime routine, your morning pancakes, and your attention with someone they've never met. If your partner came home and announced a second spouse was moving in next month, you'd have questions too.

This explains why even well-adjusted kids say things like "take the baby back" or "I don't like the baby." They're not being cruel. They're being honest about a feeling most adults would have in an equivalent scenario. The goal isn't to talk them out of that feeling. It's to prepare them so thoroughly that the reality, when it hits, is [a familiar change rather than a terrifying one](/blog/transitions/adjusting-to-a-move/).

Here's what most parents get wrong: they wait too long, say too little, and expect excitement.

## When (and how) to break the news

You've been staring at the pregnancy test for weeks, quietly freaking out about logistics. Meanwhile your kid is blissfully unaware that their world is about to rearrange itself. So when do you tell them?

**For toddlers and preschoolers, start as soon as the pregnancy is confirmed and you're comfortable sharing.** Their brains benefit from extended exposure to new information. Nine months of "the baby is growing in my belly" repeated casually at breakfast, bathtime, and during walks is infinitely more effective than one Big Reveal at month seven. Repetition converts the unfamiliar into the boring, and boring is exactly what you want.

For older kids (school-age and up), you can wait a bit longer, especially if external circumstances make early disclosure complicated. But still tell them toward the beginning of a weekend or a stretch of time together, not at bedtime or right before they leave for school. They need hours to process, get angry, ask weird questions, and test whether you still love them. Dropping the news and then sending them off to math class is not processing time.

**The script is simpler than you think.** "We're going to have a new baby. Life is going to look different. You might feel lots of feelings about it, and all of those feelings are okay. Do you have any questions?"

Then stop talking. Wait. Let them lead.

## Give them the full briefing (yes, all of it)

Your toddler is not interested in vague reassurances. "Everything will be fine" is meaningless to a three-year-old. What they want is the operational manual.

**Tell them exactly what will happen, in as much detail as you can manage.** Toddler brains like being "in the know." When they understand what's coming, the unfamiliar becomes familiar, and anxiety drops. This is the same reason adults read reviews before buying a couch. Uncertainty is stressful for every species with a cortex.

Here's what to cover:

- **Who will take care of them while you're at the hospital.** Name the person. Introduce them in advance. Do a practice sleepover.
- **What the baby will look and sound like.** Babies cry. A lot. Their heads look weird. They can't play. If your child expects a playmate and gets a screaming potato, disappointment will breed resentment. One four-year-old, upon meeting his newborn sister, reportedly said she couldn't even play with him, and that was the whole point.
- **How feeding and sleep will work.** The baby will eat constantly. Sometimes from a bottle, sometimes from a breast. It will wake up at night. Walk them through it.
- **What the first meeting will look like.** Where will they see the baby? Will they get to hold them? What should they expect to feel?

**Act it out.** Grab a doll and rehearse. Change the diaper. Practice feeding. Let your kid show you what they've learned from the books you've been reading together. Play-based learning lands harder than lectures, especially for kids under five.

## Build the relationship before the baby exists

Here's where it gets interesting. You don't have to wait until the baby is born for your child to start caring about them. The sibling bond can begin in utero, and the effort you put in now pays dividends when the actual screaming infant arrives.

**Use possessive language that creates belonging.** Say "our baby" or "your sister" or even "your baby." This isn't about ownership. It's about relationship. You say "my kid" because it signals a bond. Your child deserves the same linguistic connection to their sibling.

**Involve them in everything.** Let them pick paint colors for the baby's room. Take them to a prenatal appointment to hear the heartbeat (and make sure the doctor listens to their heartbeat too). Ponder baby names together. If you can let them choose the middle name from a shortlist you already love, do it. A child who named the baby feels invested in meeting the baby.

**Talk to the baby in front of your child.** "Your big brother is so funny. He's going to teach you how to build towers." This isn't for the baby, who is currently the size of a mango and has no idea what towers are. It's for your kid, who overhears you casting them as the capable, important older sibling the baby is lucky to have.

**Wonder aloud together.** "What do you think the baby is doing right now? Maybe hiccupping. Maybe practicing kicks." This transforms the baby from an abstract concept into a person with an inner life, which is the foundation of empathy.

If your family is weighing whether it's even the right time to expand, our [second-child readiness quiz](/quiz/second-child-readiness/) helps you think through the decision honestly.

## Teach feelings vocabulary before you need it

You know that moment when your toddler is clearly furious but can only communicate it by throwing a shoe at the wall? That's a vocabulary problem.

**Pre-teach the words "jealous," "excited," "frustrated," and "scared" before the baby arrives.** Children cannot express feelings they don't have labels for. When your kid can say "I'm jealous" instead of hitting the baby, everyone's day improves dramatically. [Helping your child name their emotions](/blog/big-feelings/naming-feelings/) is one of the highest-leverage things you can do during pregnancy.

Here's how to introduce these words naturally:

- While reading a sibling book: "I think Daniel Tiger is feeling jealous right now. Have you ever felt jealous?"
- When talking about the coming change: "Some kids feel scared when a new baby comes. Scared is when your tummy feels tight and you worry something bad might happen."
- During play: "Your teddy looks frustrated that the tower keeps falling. Frustrated means you want something to work and it won't."

You're not having A Talk. You're building an emotional toolkit one casual conversation at a time. By the time the baby arrives, your child will have words for what's happening inside them. Words are slower than fists, which is the entire point.

## What NOT to say (the common traps)

Some well-intentioned phrases backfire spectacularly. Avoid these.

**"You're going to be such a great big brother/sister."** Sounds encouraging. Actually loads your child with performance pressure. They didn't apply for this job. Don't hand them a performance review before their first day. Instead, acknowledge both roles: "You're a big sibling now, AND you're still my baby. I love holding you too." The AND matters. It tells your child they don't have to abandon their own needs to make room for someone else's.

**"The baby is a gift."** To whom? Your child did not put in a request. Forced gratitude for an unchosen situation breeds resentment, not warmth.

**"You need to be gentle with the baby."** This one's fine in context but terrible as your primary message. If the only thing your child hears about the baby is a list of restrictions (don't touch, be careful, be quiet), the baby becomes the reason they can't do anything fun. Lead with connection, not rules.

**"Don't worry, nothing will change."** Things will change. Your child knows it. Lying about it destroys trust. Better: "Some things will be different, and some things will stay exactly the same. We'll still do pizza Fridays and park on Saturdays."

That last point is worth underlining. **Establish family traditions now that naturally continue after the baby.** Friday pizza, Saturday library, Sunday playground. When the baby arrives, they slide into existing routines rather than replacing them. Your child sees continuity instead of erasure.

## The fear underneath every reaction

Your child probably won't tell you this directly, but here's what they're really asking: *Will you still love me when the baby comes?*

Every testing behavior, every regression, every "I hate the baby" statement traces back to that question. And the answer cannot be just words. **The proof is in the actions you take after the baby arrives.** You can say "I love you just as much" a thousand times, but if you never have one-on-one time with your older child again, they'll believe what they see, not what they hear.

This is especially true for kids who are worried about being replaced, a [fear that maps closely to age-specific anxiety patterns](/blog/anxiety/childhood-fears-by-age/) researchers have documented. Toddlers fear abandonment concretely (you will literally leave). School-age kids fear it abstractly (you will love me less). Both are real, and both deserve a real response.

**Here's what that response looks like:**

- 15 minutes of one-on-one time daily. Just you and them. No baby, no phone. Read, color, play on the floor. This is non-negotiable.
- Physical affection on purpose. Don't wait for them to come to you. Scoop them up. Snuggle at bedtime. They need to feel it in their body, not just hear it.
- Verbal specifics, not generic praise. "I love the way you make me laugh at dinner" beats "You're great." Specific observations prove you're still paying attention.

## Getting ready for the actual arrival

You've done the preparation. The books have been read forty times. The doll has been diapered. The baby's room is painted in a color your child chose. Now the due date is approaching and you need to nail the logistics.

**Plan who will be with your child during the birth, and do a trial run.** If Grandma is on duty, schedule a sleepover beforehand. Your child meeting their temporary caregiver for the first time while you're in active labor is a recipe for panic on top of panic.

**Time big changes well before the birth.** Room transitions, weaning, potty training: get these done months in advance. If your child moves to a big-kid bed the week the baby arrives, they won't see a developmental milestone. They'll see eviction. Changes that happen months earlier become routine. Changes that coincide with the baby become the baby's fault.

**Pack the hospital bag together.** Let your child put their photo in the bag so it's one of the first things the baby "sees." This is a small ritual with outsized emotional impact. The baby arrives into a world that already includes your older child.

And when you come home, put the baby in a bassinet or carrier before your child walks in, not in your arms. Until now, your lap has been theirs. If the first image they see is someone else occupying that space, the baby registers as a direct competitor before introductions even happen. Neutral ground first. Snuggles second.

## FAQ

**What age should I tell my child about the new baby?**

There's no universal rule, but for toddlers, start early and repeat often. Their brains need repetition to process change. For school-age kids, wait until you're ready to answer questions honestly, then tell them at the start of a long stretch together so they have time to react.

**What if my child says they hate the baby?**

That's honesty, not cruelty. Validate it: "It sounds like you're feeling really upset about the baby right now." Don't correct the emotion or guilt-trip them. Children who can express negative feelings safely are less likely to act them out physically. The feeling passes faster when it has an exit.

**Should I let my older child hold the newborn right away?**

Yes, with support. Help them cradle the baby's head and sit securely. Physical closeness triggers protective instincts (there's actual research on infant-head pheromones). The more your older child holds the baby, the faster the bond develops.

**How do I handle regression (baby talk, bed-wetting, clinginess)?**

Meet it with warmth, not frustration. Regression is your child testing whether they can still get nurturing by acting younger. Counterintuitively, "babying" them (extra snuggles, carrying them, using a gentle voice) actually resolves the regression faster than pushing them to act their age.

**Will my kids actually get along eventually?**

The early weeks are rough for almost everyone. But once the baby starts smiling at your older child specifically, something shifts. You can't manufacture that moment, but you can build the foundation that makes your child receptive to it when it arrives. [What to expect emotionally once the baby actually comes home](/blog/siblings/new-baby-arrives/) covers the adjustment period in detail.
