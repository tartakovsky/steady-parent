But the wrong chore at the wrong age sets everyone up for frustration.\n\nAnswer based on what your child can do consistently right now, not what you've seen them do once.",

      "explanation": "Your child is showing the developmental readiness, independence, and household support that makes chores sustainable — not a battle. They can follow routines, manage tasks to completion, and your home is set up to let them contribute. This is the phase where chores become part of life, not a struggle.",
      "nextSteps": [
        "**Ages 2-3:** Put toys in bins, wipe spills with a cloth, carry non-breakable items to the table, put dirty clothes in hamper, help feed pets (with supervision)",
        "**Ages 4-5:** Set the table (napkins, utensils), water plants, match socks from laundry, put away groceries (pantry items), make their bed (simple version — pull up covers)",
        "**Ages 6-7:** Clear their dishes after meals, fold simple laundry (towels, washcloths), sweep small areas, pack their school lunch (with prep done), take out bathroom trash",
        "**Ages 8-10:** Load/unload dishwasher, vacuum rooms, prepare simple meals (sandwiches, cereal), do their own laundry (with supervision at first), walk the dog, wash the car",
        "Start with one chore and build consistency before adding more — the habit matters more than the quantity"
      ],
      "watchOutFor": "Even capable kids will resist sometimes. Chores aren't always fun, and that's the point — learning to contribute even when you're not in the mood is part of the skill. Expect pushback occasionally, but don't take it as a sign they're 'not ready.'",
      "encouragement": "You've set your child up to succeed. The research is clear: kids who have regular household responsibilities develop better executive function, stronger work ethic, and more empathy. You're not just getting help with dishes — you're building competence.",

      "subheadline": "Your child can handle some responsibilities — start small and build gradually.",
      "explanation": "Your child has some strong readiness signs and some areas still developing. This is the most common result — very few children are independently managing chores across the board. Look at the domain breakdown below to see where to focus your energy first.",
      "nextSteps": [
        "**Start with simple, one-step tasks:** Put dirty clothes in hamper, push in their chair, put shoes by the door, throw trash in the bin",
        "**Make tools accessible:** Step stool for sink, child-sized broom, bins at their level, dishes they can reach",
        "**Do it together first:** 'I'll spray, you wipe' or 'I'll pour, you stir' — collaborative work builds skills without overwhelming them",
        "**Focus on one consistent chore before adding more:** Pick something short with immediate visible results (wipe the table, feed the cat)",

      "watchOutFor": "Don't fall into the trap of redoing what they just did. Crooked forks and wrinkled towels are fine — perfection kills motivation. If you need it done right, do it yourself. If you want them to learn, let it be messy.",
      "encouragement": "Your child is closer to readiness than you might think. The skills that make chores stick — persistence, pride in contribution, tolerance for mistakes — grow through practice, not waiting. Start smaller than feels useful, and build from there.",

        "**Ages 2-3:** Hand you items while you load the dishwasher, help push laundry into the washer, carry their plate to the counter, 'help' wipe their high chair tray",

        "**All ages:** Do chores together as companionship, not productivity — let them 'help' even when it slows you down",
        "**Fix the environment first:** If tools aren't accessible or you don't have time to supervise, chores will feel like constant nagging. Start with setup changes before adding expectations.",

      ],
      "watchOutFor": "Resist the urge to push chores before readiness is there. Forced participation at this stage teaches 'chores are a punishment' instead of 'I'm a contributing member of this family.' Wait until they can succeed with support, not just comply under pressure.",
      "encouragement": "You're asking the right questions at the right time. The fact that you're thinking about readiness — rather than just assigning tasks and hoping for the best — means you're already setting your child up for long-term success. Give it time.",
      "comparativeContext": "Many parents find their child ready for simple, consistent chores after another 6-12 months of development. There's no rush — early positive experiences matter more than early productivity.",
