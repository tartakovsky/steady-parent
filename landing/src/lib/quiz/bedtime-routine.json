        "Accept that the sleep transition will require your full support for now. You can't teach independence until the other pieces are in place.",

      "encouragement": "Bedtime is a disaster right now, which means you have nowhere to go but up. The domain breakdown shows you exactly where to start. Pick one domain — probably environment or wind-down — and build it deliberately. Small wins compound.",
      "comparativeContext": "About one in four parents report that bedtime is a consistent struggle. In most cases, the issue is routine mismatch rather than a child who 'won't sleep' — the right structure just hasn't been built yet."
