This quiz helps you see where your routine is already strong and where small tweaks could make a big difference.\n\nAnswer based on what typically happens, not your best night or worst night.",

      "encouragement": "You're starting from scratch, and that's actually an advantage — you're not trying to tweak a broken system, you're building a new one. Sleep routines respond to consistency faster than almost any other parenting challenge. Two weeks of boring repetition creates a bedtime that works.",
