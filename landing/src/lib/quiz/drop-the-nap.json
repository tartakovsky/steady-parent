    "intro": "The nap transition is one of the trickier sleep milestones — too early and you have a meltdown machine, too late and bedtime becomes a three-hour standoff. Most children naturally drop the nap somewhere between 2.5 and 5 years old.\n\nAnswer based on what happens most days, not just the occasional great day or disaster day.",
