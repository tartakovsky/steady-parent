    "intro": "A first sleepover is a big milestone — and readiness isn't just about age. It's about how comfortable your child is separating from you, managing their own routines, and handling unexpected emotions in an unfamiliar place.\n\nAnswer based on what your child does most of the time, not their best or worst day.",

      "watchOutFor": "Well-meaning friends or family may push: 'Just try it, they'll be fine!' But you know your child. A child who's not ready will likely have a distressing experience that makes the next attempt even harder. Protecting them from that is not overprotective — it's responsive parenting.",
      "encouragement": "You're doing the right thing by pausing and assessing. Sleepovers are not a developmental requirement — they're a social milestone that works best when the child is genuinely ready. There's no harm in waiting, and significant benefit in getting the timing right.",
