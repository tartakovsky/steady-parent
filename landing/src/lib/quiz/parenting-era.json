      "tagline": "You're getting through each day — consistency can wait until everyone sleeps three hours straight.",
      "themeColor": "#d05597",
      "description": "You're in triage mode. The question isn't 'what's optimal' — it's 'what gets us to bedtime without casualties.' You know what good parenting looks like in theory. Right now theory lives in a drawer you'll open when you sleep more than four hours.",
      "strengths": [
        "You've mastered picking your battles — not philosophically, out of necessity",
        "You don't waste energy on performance parenting or keeping up appearances",
        "You know how to get a kid fed, dressed, and out the door with terrifying efficiency"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "The shortcuts that worked when you were drowning calcify into patterns you don't love. One tiny routine — same time, same steps, two weeks — gives you surprising breathing room.",
      "encouragement": "Survival mode isn't a moral failure. It's what happens when the demands outpace your capacity — which is most of early parenting. The goal right now isn't to optimize, it's to not burn out before they turn four. You're doing the hardest part.",
      "comparativeContext": "Most parents cycle through survival mode during major transitions — new baby, illness, job changes, or just particularly feral developmental phases."

      "name": "The Finding My Voice Era",
      "tagline": "You're trying approaches, discarding what doesn't fit, and figuring out what kind of parent you are.",
      "themeColor": "#e8c840",
      "description": "You're past just surviving but not on autopilot. You're testing the scripts and discovering which ones feel like you and which ones feel like community theater. You're building your parenting identity in real time.",
      "strengths": [
        "You're open to trying new approaches instead of white-knuckling what isn't working",
        "You're developing real opinions about what matters to you versus what's just noise",
        "You notice when something works and double down instead of moving to the next shiny thing"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Trying everything means committing to nothing long enough to see if it works. Pick one thing — just one — and run it for a full month before deciding if it's you. Consistency beats novelty every time.",
      "encouragement": "This is the era where you stop performing someone else's parenting philosophy and start building your own. It's supposed to feel uncertain — you're not following the map anymore, you're drawing it. The parents who skip this phase never figure out what actually works for them.",
      "comparativeContext": "Parents typically hit this phase after the fog of early survival lifts but before routines harden — often when kids are 2-5 years old."

      "themeColor": "#16a34a",
      "description": "You've built a system that keeps the wheels on most days. You know which battles to fight and which to let slide. You can predict meltdowns and head off half of them. You're not looking for the next framework because you know what works.",
      "strengths": [
        "You trust your read on your kid more than you trust parenting influencers",
        "Your routines run on muscle memory, which frees up bandwidth for actual parenting",
        "You course-correct small problems before they become big ones"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "The system that worked at age three can cage you at age six. When something stops working, you resist tweaking it. Stay dialed-in to your kid, not just your routines.",
      "encouragement": "This is the sweet spot most parents are chasing. You've earned the confidence that comes with reps — you've done this enough times to know what you're doing. The trick is staying flexible enough to evolve when your kid does, without dismantling what's working.",
      "comparativeContext": "Parents in this era often have school-age kids and a few years of parenting under their belt — enough experience to trust their instincts."

    "letting-go": {
      "id": "letting-go",
      "name": "The Letting Go Era",
      "tagline": "You're learning to step back, trust their competence, and resist swooping in unnecessarily.",
      "themeColor": "#3b82f6",
      "description": "You've built the foundation and taught the skills. Now the work is getting out of the way. Your kid is capable of more than you reflexively give them credit for. The hardest part is watching them struggle without intervening.",
      "strengths": [
        "You can tolerate watching them fail at something when you know they'll learn from it",
        "You've stopped doing things for them that they can do for themselves",
        "You give advice when asked and shut up when you're not — most of the time"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "The line between supportive and hovering shifts constantly. You're sometimes still parenting the kid they were instead of who they are now. Check in about what help they actually want.",
      "encouragement": "Letting go doesn't mean checking out. It means trusting that the work you already did will hold. The parents who can't do this raise kids who either rebel hard or never launch. You're giving them the gift of their own competence.",
      "comparativeContext": "This phase starts earlier than most parents expect — often around age 7-9 for daily skills, and intensifies through the teen years."
