      "themeColor": "#00b86b",
      "description": "You balance warmth with structure — explaining the reasons behind your rules, listening to your child's perspective, and adjusting when it makes sense. You're firm without being rigid and loving without being a pushover.",
      "strengths": [
        "You explain your reasoning instead of relying on 'because I said so'",
        "You adjust boundaries based on your child's development and the situation",

        "You model the self-regulation you're asking them to learn"

      "growthEdge": "You can overthink decisions and second-guess yourself. Sometimes the right call is the quick one — not every boundary needs a dissertation.",
      "encouragement": "Your kids are learning that rules and love aren't opposites. The fact that you question your approach means you're doing it with intention. That's exactly what they need.",

      "encouragement": "Structure is genuinely important — kids without it feel anxious, not free. Your instinct to protect and organize is real love. Adding a little flexibility alongside your consistency will make your approach even more powerful.",
      "comparativeContext": "About 1 in 4 parents lean toward structure-first approaches. Many report feeling like the 'strict' parent among their friends."

      "growthEdge": "Saying no is a form of love too. Kids need the discomfort of limits to develop self-regulation. Start small — pick one non-negotiable boundary and hold it consistently for a week.",
      "encouragement": "The closeness you've built with your child is real and valuable. Adding more structure won't damage that bond — it'll actually deepen it, because kids feel safer when they know someone's in charge.",
      "comparativeContext": "About 1 in 5 parents identify primarily with a permissive approach. It's especially common among parents who grew up with very strict parents themselves."
