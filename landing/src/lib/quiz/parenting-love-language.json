      "tagline": "You show love through presence — the phone goes down, the world gets quiet, and it's just you two.",
      "themeColor": "#3b82f6",
      "description": "For you, love is measured in uninterrupted minutes. You're the parent who turns off notifications during bedtime, who sits on the floor for the full tea party instead of half-listening from the couch. You don't need grand gestures — just eye contact and your full attention.",
      "strengths": [
        "Your kid knows when they have you, they really have you — no divided attention",
        "You create moments your child will remember, not because they're fancy but because you were fully there",
        "You model what it means to be present, a rare skill in a distracted world"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Quality time is gold, but it's also your comfort zone. Try expanding your toolkit — sometimes a quick hug or a sticky note on their lunch says 'I love you' when schedules are tight.",
      "encouragement": "Keep showing up the way you do. The world tells parents to do more, but you're doing something harder and better: being more. Your kid feels seen, and that's everything.",
      "comparativeContext": "Research shows that just 15 minutes of focused attention per day builds secure attachment as effectively as hours of distracted co-presence."

      "tagline": "You show love through words — you're the parent who narrates their wins out loud so they hear how amazing they are.",
      "themeColor": "#10b981",
      "description": "You're fluent in encouragement. When your kid builds a block tower, you don't just notice — you say exactly what you saw and why it mattered. You verbalize pride, effort, progress. Your kid doesn't have to guess if you're proud; they hear it in real time.",
      "strengths": [
        "Your child has a running soundtrack of affirmation — they internalize your words and carry them forward",
        "You're quick to repair after hard moments because you know how to name feelings and rebuild connection",
        "You teach your kid how to speak kindly to themselves by modeling kind self-talk out loud"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Words are powerful, but they're not the only way in. Some kids need a hand on their shoulder or shared silence. Watch for when your kid pulls away from praise.",
      "encouragement": "Your words are building your child's inner voice. That's not small. Keep naming what you see, especially the effort and character stuff that nobody else notices.",
      "comparativeContext": "Studies show that specific verbal affirmation correlates strongly with self-esteem in middle childhood and adolescence."

    "fixer": {
      "id": "fixer",
      "name": "The Fixer",
      "tagline": "You show love through action — you pack the lunch, find the lost shoe, and solve the problem before they ask.",
      "themeColor": "#f59e0b",
      "description": "You're the parent who anticipates needs. Hungry after practice? Snack is already in the car. Forgot their project supplies? You've got a backup plan. Love, for you, is doing the invisible work that makes their life smoother.",
      "strengths": [
        "You create a stable, predictable environment where your kid can relax because they trust you've got it handled",
        "You teach responsibility through modeling — they see what it looks like to show up and follow through",
        "Your kid feels cared for in concrete, tangible ways that are hard to miss"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Doing for them works until it doesn't. Sometimes the greatest act of service is stepping back. Try narrating your care out loud so they know it's love, not logistics.",
      "encouragement": "The world undervalues care work, but you know better. You're teaching your kid that love is a verb. Just make sure they see the verb, not just the results.",
      "comparativeContext": "Parents who perform high levels of instrumental support report strong relationships, but research also shows kids benefit when they see the care as intentional rather than automatic."

    "bear-hugger": {
      "id": "bear-hugger",
      "name": "The Bear Hugger",
      "tagline": "You show love through touch — a squeeze, a ruffle, a hand on their back. Your affection is physical and immediate.",
      "themeColor": "#ec4899",
      "description": "You're tactile by default. You reach for your kid when they're sad, excited, or just walking by. A hug is your punctuation mark, your comma, your exclamation point. Physical closeness is how you say 'I'm here' without saying anything at all.",
      "strengths": [
        "Your child gets a steady dose of oxytocin and nervous system regulation from your touch",
        "You offer comfort that doesn't require words — especially helpful when emotions are too big to name",
        "You create a baseline of safety and warmth that follows your kid into the world"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Not every kid wants to be touched all the time, and that can feel like rejection. Pay attention to their cues and translate your love into other forms when they need space.",
      "encouragement": "Physical affection is one of the most direct ways to communicate safety. You're wiring your kid's nervous system for connection. That's not nothing.",
      "comparativeContext": "Research consistently links appropriate parental physical affection with lower cortisol levels, better emotional regulation, and higher self-worth in children."
