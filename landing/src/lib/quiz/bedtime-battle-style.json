      "themeColor": "#6366f1",
      "description": "You approach bedtime like a diplomatic summit. Your child asks for one more story, and you counter with half a story and a bonus lullaby. You genuinely believe that if you can just find the right deal, everyone walks away satisfied. Your child has figured this out and is now a better negotiator than most lawyers.",
      "strengths": [
        "You model problem-solving and compromise in real time, even when exhausted",
        "Your child feels heard, which reduces the intensity of bedtime resistance over time",
        "You stay calm under pressure because you're focused on finding the deal, not winning the war"

      "encouragement": "Your instinct to connect and problem-solve is genuinely valuable. The trick is knowing when to negotiate and when to say, with love, that the negotiation window has closed. Your kid already knows you'll listen — now they need to know where the wall is.",

      "description": "You have a bedtime routine and it runs on a schedule that would make an airline jealous. Bath, teeth, one story, lights out. Deviations are not entertained. Your child knows exactly what to expect, which is both your greatest strength and the thing they test most aggressively.",

      ],
      "growthEdge": "Rigidity works until it doesn't. When your child genuinely needs connection or is processing a hard day, the schedule can become a wall between you instead of a container for them.",
      "encouragement": "Structure is one of the most underrated gifts a parent can give. Your child may push back now, but predictability is literally what their developing brain needs to feel safe enough to sleep. The key is building in small moments of warmth inside the structure, not instead of it.",

      "description": "You fold like a lawn chair the moment your child says they're scared, lonely, or not tired yet. You know the sleep experts would judge you. You also know that your kid's tiny hand reaching for yours in the dark is the whole reason you became a parent. Your bedtimes are long, warm, and completely without boundaries.",
      "strengths": [
        "Your child feels deeply loved and connected at the most vulnerable time of day",
        "You're attuned to genuine emotional needs that other styles might dismiss too quickly",
        "Your flexibility means your child never feels abandoned or shut out at bedtime"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Your child has learned that emotional appeals are the skeleton key to extending bedtime indefinitely. Distinguishing between genuine need and strategic deployment of cuteness would change everything.",
      "encouragement": "Your warmth is real and your child knows it. The goal isn't to become cold at bedtime — it's to be warm and done. You can be the parent who gives great hugs and also the parent who leaves the room. These aren't opposites.",
      "comparativeContext": "Research shows that bedtime connection reduces nighttime waking, so your instinct toward warmth has real sleep benefits when paired with clear endings."

      "themeColor": "#059669",
      "description": "You treat bedtime resistance as an engineering problem. When the direct approach fails, you build systems. Reward charts, sleep fairy visits, monster spray, glow-in-the-dark worry stones, elaborate point systems that would confuse an economist. Your child's bedtime routine has more moving parts than a Swiss watch, and honestly, most of them work — for about two weeks.",
      "strengths": [
        "You meet your child's imagination where it lives, which makes bedtime feel like an adventure instead of a punishment",
        "Your systems often genuinely work because they give your child agency and motivation",
        "You adapt quickly when one approach stops working, which means bedtime never becomes a permanent war"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "When every bedtime requires a new trick, your child learns it's a performance rather than a transition. Sometimes the simplest routine is the most sustainable one.",
      "encouragement": "Your creativity signals something important: you're willing to work hard to make bedtime work for everyone. That flexibility is rare and valuable. The next level is figuring out which of your many inventions to keep and which to retire, so bedtime gets simpler over time instead of more elaborate.",
      "comparativeContext": "Parents who use creative behavioral strategies report higher satisfaction with bedtime, though effectiveness tends to plateau after the novelty period unless paired with consistent boundaries."
