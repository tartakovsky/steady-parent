      "themeColor": "#3b82f6",
      "description": "When worry strikes, you open fourteen browser tabs. You're the parent who's read every developmental milestone chart, memorized safe sleep guidelines, and can cite statistics about playground injuries. Information is your security blanket — if you understand all the variables, you can control the outcome.",
      "strengths": [
        "You're exceptionally prepared for the predictable risks — your diaper bag has supplies for scenarios other parents haven't imagined",
        "You catch developmental delays early because you actually know what normal looks like at each age",
        "Your kids benefit from evidence-based choices — you don't fall for parenting trends without checking the research"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "The research never ends, and no amount of information eliminates uncertainty. Learning to sit with 'I don't know' without immediately Googling it would free up significant mental space.",
      "encouragement": "Your impulse to understand is valuable — it's led to genuinely better parenting decisions. The shift is recognizing when more research becomes avoidance rather than problem-solving. Trust that you've studied enough.",
      "comparativeContext": "Parents with this pattern often have backgrounds in academic or analytical fields where expertise equals safety."

      "themeColor": "#10b981",
      "description": "You're the parent mentally mapping exits at birthday parties, watching toddlers near stairs like a hawk, triple-checking car seat installations. Your nervous system is always on — scanning for the sharp corner, the wobbly table, the kid who plays too rough. Rest feels impossible because danger never takes a break.",
      "strengths": [
        "You've prevented genuine accidents because you spotted the hazard before it became a problem",
        "Your kids are safer in objectively dangerous situations — you don't miss the uncovered outlet or the unlocked pool gate",
        "You're the parent other parents want around in emergencies because you're already three steps ahead"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Not every moment requires threat assessment, and your body can't sustain this level of vigilance indefinitely. Learning which risks actually warrant attention would let you relax occasionally.",
      "encouragement": "Your protectiveness has kept your kids safe in real ways. The work is recalibrating your threat detector so it doesn't fire at shadows — trusting that most moments are actually fine.",
      "comparativeContext": "This pattern often intensifies after a previous parenting scare or personal trauma history."

      "themeColor": "#f59e0b",
      "description": "A fever becomes meningitis, a playground conflict becomes lifelong social isolation, a toddler's speech delay becomes academic failure. Your brain doesn't stop at the immediate worry — it builds entire disaster narratives, complete with worst-case outcomes and your imagined regret for not preventing them.",
      "strengths": [
        "You're excellent at contingency planning because you've already imagined seventeen ways things could go wrong",
        "You take precautionary health measures seriously — you don't dismiss symptoms that warrant actual attention",
        "Your ability to anticipate problems means you're rarely caught completely off-guard"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Almost none of your catastrophic predictions come true, yet you invest enormous energy in them. Learning to spot when worry becomes catastrophic fantasy would reduce unnecessary suffering.",
      "encouragement": "The ability to think ahead is useful — it's what makes you plan for real contingencies. The shift is noticing when you've crossed from planning into storytelling about disasters that haven't happened and likely won't.",
      "comparativeContext": "Research shows catastrophizing correlates strongly with generalized anxiety, not actual risk prediction accuracy."

      "themeColor": "#8b5cf6",
      "description": "On the surface, you're the chill parent. You don't hover at the playground, you don't visibly panic, you make jokes when other parents are freaking out. But internally, you're running the same disaster simulations — you've just learned to hide it. The gap between your inner turmoil and outer composure is exhausting.",
      "strengths": [
        "Your kids don't absorb your anxiety the way they would if you were visibly spiraling — they get a calmer model",
        "You're functional under stress because you've practiced appearing fine when you're not",
        "Other parents see you as a steady presence, which often becomes true through repetition"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Suppressing anxiety isn't the same as managing it, and the performance eventually takes a toll. Learning to acknowledge your worry to safe people would reduce the isolation of carrying it alone.",
      "encouragement": "Your composure serves your kids well — they benefit from not having to manage your visible anxiety. But you don't have to white-knuckle it in silence. Finding one or two people who get to see the real worry would ease the load.",
      "comparativeContext": "This pattern is common among parents who grew up with the message that visible anxiety was weakness or burden."
