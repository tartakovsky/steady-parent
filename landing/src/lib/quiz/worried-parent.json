      "themeColor": "#3b82f6",
      "description": "Uncertainty is your cue to learn. The pediatrician says something vague, you're on PubMed before you reach the parking lot. You know the normal range for fevers, the actual statistics on playground injuries, and which car seat got recalled last Tuesday. Knowledge is how you get your footing back.",
      "strengths": [
        "You catch real problems early because you actually know what to look for — not because you panic, because you studied",
        "Your kids benefit from evidence-based decisions instead of whatever the latest Instagram trend says",
        "You're the friend other parents text when they need an actual answer, not a platitude"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Research has diminishing returns, and your body can't tell productive learning from avoidance-by-Googling. Notice when the tabs stop helping and the scrolling is just compulsive.",
      "encouragement": "Your instinct to understand is genuinely useful — it's led to real, measurable better outcomes. The work is letting yourself close the laptop before you've read everything ever written on the subject.",

      "description": "You walk into a birthday party and your eyes do a full sweep before your kid even takes off their shoes. Pool gate locked? Check. Choking hazards on the table? Noted. Sketchy trampoline in the backyard? You're already calculating your exit strategy. Your nervous system runs a background security scan everywhere you go.",
      "strengths": [
        "You've prevented actual accidents — not hypothetical ones — because you spotted the hazard when everyone else was chatting",
        "Your kids are measurably safer in genuinely risky environments because you don't stop paying attention",
        "You're the parent everyone wants at the pool party, the playground, the field trip"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Your scanner doesn't have an off switch, and your body pays for that. Learning to triage — which environments actually require this level of attention — would let you rest occasionally.",
      "encouragement": "Your vigilance has real, concrete value. Kids are safer around you, full stop. The shift is recalibrating so your threat detector isn't firing at the same volume in the living room as it does at the lake.",
      "comparativeContext": "This pattern often intensifies after a genuine scare — a near-miss or an ER visit that proved the instinct right."

      "description": "A cough becomes pneumonia, a playground squabble becomes lifelong social isolation, a mediocre report card becomes dropping out. Your mind doesn't stop at the present concern — it builds a complete narrative arc with worst-case climax and your regret as the final scene. You're living in Act III before Act I has even finished.",
      "strengths": [
        "You're excellent at contingency planning because you've already imagined seventeen failure modes for every scenario",
        "You take warning signs seriously — when a symptom actually matters, you don't dismiss it because you've already gamed it out",
        "Your future-thinking means your kids are rarely caught unprepared for transitions or changes"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Almost none of your disaster movies come true, but you invest real emotional energy in each one. Noticing when you've crossed from useful planning into fictional suffering would save you genuine pain.",
      "encouragement": "The ability to think ahead is a legitimate asset — it's what makes you plan well and prepare your kids for things other parents don't anticipate. The shift is catching yourself mid-screenplay and asking: is this planning, or is this suffering in advance?",
      "comparativeContext": "Research links this pattern more strongly to general threat sensitivity than to actual risk prediction accuracy."

      "description": "Outside: easy smile, measured voice, the parent who makes jokes while waiting for test results. Inside: running the same catastrophic simulations as everyone else, just with the volume turned down to the outside world. You learned somewhere that visible worry is a burden, and you've gotten very good at carrying it alone.",
      "strengths": [
        "Your kids get a calm model when it counts — they don't absorb your internal weather because you don't make it theirs",
        "You're functional in genuine crises because you've practiced composure under pressure for years",
        "Other parents look to you as a stabilizing presence — and through repetition, it's become partly true"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Containing worry isn't the same as processing it, and the gap between what you show and what you feel is exhausting. Finding one or two people who get the unfiltered version would help.",
      "encouragement": "Your composure serves your kids well — they genuinely benefit from not having to manage your visible anxiety. But white-knuckling it in silence has a shelf life. You don't need to perform calm for everyone. Just find the people who can handle the real version.",
      "comparativeContext": "This pattern is common among parents who grew up in homes where visible emotion was treated as weakness or inconvenience."

      "themeColor": "#ef4444",
      "description": "When uncertainty hits, you don't sit with it — you fix it. Kid has a weird rash? You're already in the car heading to urgent care. Teacher flags a concern? You've got a tutor booked by dinner. Your hands need to be doing something, and waiting feels physically impossible. If there's a lever to pull, you're pulling it.",
      "strengths": [
        "Problems don't linger because you're already solving them — your kids get interventions fast, not after months of hand-wringing",
        "You model agency for your kids: when something is wrong, you do something about it rather than hoping it resolves",
        "You're the parent who actually follows through — the appointment gets made, the conversation happens, the form gets filed"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Not every worry needs immediate action, and sometimes the best move is waiting. Learning to distinguish between problems that need solving now and feelings that need a minute would save energy.",
      "encouragement": "Your bias toward action is genuinely useful — your kids' problems get addressed, not ignored. The growth is recognizing that sometimes the most productive thing you can do is sit still for five minutes and see if the worry passes on its own.",
      "comparativeContext": "This pattern is particularly common among parents with high-demand jobs where decisiveness is rewarded and delay feels risky."
