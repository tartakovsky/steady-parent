      "explanation": "Devices are available and always on, screens are the go-to for hard moments and downtime, much of the content runs unsupervised, and going without feels impossible. This isn't about anyone being addicted — it's about your whole family's system having gradually made screens central. The domain breakdown below shows you exactly where to start, and the research is clear: families who make targeted environmental changes see real shifts within two to three weeks.",

        "Expect one to two hard weeks when you start changing things — that's the adjustment period, not proof it's failing",
        "Look at your own screen habits too — the research is clear that family-wide changes stick better than rules that only apply to kids"

      "watchOutFor": "If reducing screen time causes extreme, prolonged meltdowns daily for more than two weeks, talk to your pediatrician. Sometimes intense screen dependence signals underlying regulation challenges that deserve professional attention.",
      "encouragement": "You're here reading this, which means you're questioning the pattern. That awareness is genuinely the hardest step. Research on families who successfully pulled back shows one consistent finding: they didn't do it all at once. They changed one thing, stuck with it, then changed one more.",
      "comparativeContext": "Research shows that even families with very high screen use can shift to balanced patterns within two to three months of consistent environmental changes. The first two weeks are the hardest — it gets markedly easier after that.",
      "shareableSummary": "Screens have quietly taken over more of our family's day than we realized — time to start pulling back, one small change at a time.",
