        "If Parenting Triggers is low: identify the one moment you most reliably reach for a screen and line up a single alternative",

      "watchOutFor": "The temptation is to overhaul everything at once. Don't. Pick one domain, make one adjustment, and live with it for two weeks. Trying to change four things simultaneously usually means nothing sticks.",
      "encouragement": "You're in the zone where small, targeted changes make the biggest difference. A month from now this can look completely different — not through a revolution, but through one or two adjustments in the right spot.",
      "comparativeContext": "Most families score in this range. Research shows that one or two targeted environmental changes — like a screen-free mealtime or moving a device — typically shift family screen patterns within two to three weeks.",

      "subheadline": "Screens are doing a lot of heavy lifting in your family right now.",
      "explanation": "Devices are everywhere and always on, screens are the go-to for hard moments and downtime, much of the viewing runs without guidance, and unplugging feels like it would cause a meltdown. This isn't about addiction or bad parenting — it's about your whole family's routines having gradually organized around screens. The domain breakdown below shows exactly where the weight is, and the research is clear: families who make targeted environmental changes see real shifts within two to three weeks.",
      "nextSteps": [
        "Start with the ENVIRONMENT, not rules: move one device, create one screen-free zone, or establish one unplugged meal",
        "Pick your easiest win from the domain breakdown — whichever area feels most changeable right now",
        "Expect one to two hard weeks when you first change things — that's the adjustment period, not proof it's failing",
        "Look at your own screen habits too — the research is clear that family-wide changes stick better than rules that only apply to kids"
      ],
      "watchOutFor": "If reducing screen time causes extreme, prolonged meltdowns daily for more than two weeks, talk to your pediatrician. Sometimes intense screen dependence signals underlying regulation challenges that deserve professional attention.",
      "encouragement": "You're here reading this, which means you're questioning the pattern. That awareness is genuinely the hardest step. Research on families who successfully pulled back shows one consistent finding: they didn't do it all at once. They changed one thing, stuck with it, then changed one more.",
      "comparativeContext": "Research shows that even families with very high screen use can shift to balanced patterns within two to three months of consistent environmental changes. The first two weeks are the hardest — it gets markedly easier after that.",
      "shareableSummary": "Screens have quietly taken over more of our family's day than we realized — time to start making changes, one small step at a time.",
      "retakeAdvice": "Retake in 6-8 weeks after making one or two environmental changes"
