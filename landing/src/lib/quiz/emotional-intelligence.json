It means they have the building blocks: they can name feelings, recover from upsets, notice when someone else is struggling, and work through conflicts without constant adult rescue.

      "explanation": "A low EQ score doesn't mean your child is destined to struggle socially or emotionally. It means they're early in the process of learning how to recognize, name, and manage feelings — both their own and others'. Some kids are slower to develop these skills due to temperament, sensory sensitivities, language delays, or just developmental timing.

      "watchOutFor": "When emotional skills are this early, the temptation is to punish the behavior — time-outs for hitting, consequences for meltdowns. But you can't punish a skill gap into existence. Consequences might be necessary for safety, but they won't teach regulation. Co-regulation, modeling, and practice will.",
      "encouragement": "Emotional intelligence develops over years, not months. The fact that your child is behind their peers right now doesn't predict where they'll be at 10, 15, or 25. Focus on one skill at a time, celebrate tiny progress, and don't compare them to siblings or classmates. Their timeline is their own.",
      "comparativeContext": "Research shows that children who receive consistent coaching in emotional awareness and regulation show significant skill growth within 6-12 months, even when starting from a low baseline. Early intervention matters, and these skills are highly responsive to practice."
