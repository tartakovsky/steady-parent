      "themeColor": "#3b82f6",
      "description": "You're the parent who sees past the surface chaos to what's actually happening. When your kid melts down over the wrong color cup, you know it's not about the cup. You spot hunger masquerading as whining, exhaustion dressed up as defiance, and overwhelm hiding behind aggression. Other parents see bad behavior; you see unmet needs.",
      "strengths": [
        "You decode behavior patterns other parents miss—connecting dots between sleep, hunger, and meltdowns",
        "You stay curious during tantrums instead of taking them personally",

      "encouragement": "Your ability to understand what's driving behavior is a genuine gift. The parents who struggle most are the ones who can't see past the surface. You already have the hard part down. Now just trust your reads and act on them faster.",

      "themeColor": "#10b981",
      "description": "You're the parent who doesn't lose it when the morning goes sideways. Spilled milk, forgotten backpack, toddler refusing pants—you absorb it without spiraling. And when you do snap (because everyone does), you recover quickly. You don't hold grudges or stew in guilt. You reset and move on.",
      "strengths": [
        "You regulate yourself in real-time during tantrums and defiance without needing a recovery day",
        "You apologize and repair without shame spirals or defensive justifications",
        "You model emotional recovery for your kids—they see you mess up and come back steady"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "You might reset so quickly that you skip reflection. Sometimes the pattern is worth examining, not just bouncing back from.",
      "encouragement": "Your emotional steadiness is the foundation everything else is built on. Parents who can't regulate themselves can't teach regulation. You're already doing the hardest part of parenting—staying sane when everything's on fire.",

      "description": "You're the parent kids confide in. Not just your own kids—other kids too. You create safety without trying. Kids tell you things they don't tell anyone else because you listen without judgment, without fixing, without making it about you. You make space for the hard feelings.",
      "strengths": [
        "You hold space for big emotions without trying to fix, distract, or dismiss them",
        "You ask questions that help kids articulate feelings they didn't know they had",
        "You build trust that lasts—kids remember feeling safe with you years later"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "You can absorb so much emotional labor that you forget to enforce limits. Connection doesn't require saying yes to everything.",
      "encouragement": "The attachment research is unambiguous: kids who feel deeply seen and heard develop better emotional regulation, stronger peer relationships, and more resilience. You're giving your kids the foundation that matters most.",
      "comparativeContext": "Secure attachment predicts better outcomes than IQ, household income, or parenting style."

      "description": "You're the parent who builds scaffolding that holds. Bedtime routines that stick, morning systems that prevent meltdowns, chore charts that actually get used. You see the pattern in the chaos and design around it. Other parents wing it; you engineer solutions.",
      "strengths": [
        "You design routines that prevent problems instead of just reacting to them",
        "You iterate on systems that don't work instead of blaming your kid for not following them",
        "You give your kids predictability, which is one of the most underrated gifts in parenting"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "You can over-structure to the point where there's no room for spontaneity or emotional flexibility. Sometimes the routine needs to break.",
      "encouragement": "The parents who struggle most are the ones living in constant reactivity, lurching from crisis to crisis. You've built systems that create breathing room. That's not rigidity—that's intelligence.",
      "comparativeContext": "Children with predictable routines show lower cortisol levels and better self-regulation across the board."
