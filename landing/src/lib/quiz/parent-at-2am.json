      "description": "You're constantly striking deals at 2 AM. Just one more song, one more sip of water, one more story and then sleep. You believe reason still works in the middle of the night, even when all evidence suggests otherwise. Your negotiations get increasingly creative as exhaustion deepens.",

      "description": "You operate entirely on muscle memory at 2 AM. You've done this so many times your body just takes over—diaper change, bottle, back rub, all while barely conscious. You have no memory of the night and sometimes wake up confused about whether it even happened.",
      "strengths": [
        "You don't get emotionally activated or frustrated at night",

        "You're pragmatic and prioritize what actually works over what 'should' work",
