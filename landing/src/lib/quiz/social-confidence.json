      "headline": "Just Starting Out",
      "subheadline": "Your child is building foundational social skills. They're watching more than participating, struggling with conflicts, or relying heavily on you in social settings.",
      "explanation": "A low score means your child doesn't yet have the tools to operate independently in social contexts. This could be developmental (they're young or late-blooming socially), temperamental (slow-to-warm-up is real), or a skills gap (they've had limited peer experience). Whatever the cause, the path forward is the same: start small, build one skill at a time, and don't force situations they're not ready for. Social confidence isn't built by throwing kids into the deep end — it's built through hundreds of small successful interactions.",
      "nextSteps": [
        "Start with one-on-one playdates in your home with one familiar peer — group settings are advanced mode",
        "Pick one communication script and practice it relentlessly: \"Can I have a turn?\" or \"I don't like that.\" One phrase, 100 reps.",
        "Narrate social situations as they happen: \"She asked to join, and they said yes. That's how you do it.\" Kids learn by watching and naming.",
        "If separation is the blocker, practice brief departures in safe settings — 5 minutes with a trusted caregiver, building up slowly",
        "If this pattern persists past age 5-6 or is worsening, consult a pediatrician or child psychologist about social communication screening"
      ],
      "watchOutFor": "Don't confuse introversion with low social confidence. Introverted kids can have strong social skills — they just use them selectively. If your child wants to engage but can't, that's a skills issue. If they don't want to engage and are content, that might just be temperament.",
      "encouragement": "Building social confidence from scratch is slow, repetitive work. You're not behind — you're starting from where your child actually is, which is the only place you can start. Pick one domain, one skill, one script. Make it smaller than feels meaningful. Then do it 50 times.",
      "comparativeContext": "Studies on social competence development show that children who struggle with peer interaction at age 3-4 often catch up by age 6-7 when given consistent, low-pressure practice opportunities and explicit skill coaching."
