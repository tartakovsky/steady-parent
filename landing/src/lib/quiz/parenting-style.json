      "tagline": "You're the steady beam — warm, firm, and always explaining why.",
      "themeColor": "#2563eb",
      "description": "You set clear boundaries and then actually explain the reasoning behind them, which means you spend a lot of time saying 'because here's the thing...' to a person who's four. You balance warmth with structure, and your kids know exactly where the lines are — even when they test every single one.",
      "strengths": [
        "Sets boundaries and explains the reasoning without writing a thesis",
        "Stays calm-ish when the meltdown hits peak volume",
        "Follows through on consequences even when it's deeply inconvenient",
        "Makes kids feel heard without caving to every demand"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Sometimes the explanation can wait. Not every teachable moment needs to be taught right now — especially at full volume in a parking lot.",
      "encouragement": "Your kids are building an internal compass because you bother to explain the 'why.' That's tedious work that pays off when they're fifteen and making decisions you can't supervise. The consistency matters more than getting it perfect every time.",
      "comparativeContext": "Research consistently links this warm-but-firm approach with strong self-regulation and social skills in kids across cultures."

      "tagline": "Structure through play — you make the rules feel like a group project.",
      "themeColor": "#06b6d4",
      "description": "You'd rather negotiate a creative solution than lay down the law, and you're weirdly good at turning conflict into collaboration. Your household runs on flexibility and humor, which looks chaotic from the outside but actually has more structure than people realize. You read the room before you pick your battles.",
      "strengths": [
        "Turns a brewing power struggle into a problem-solving session",
        "Adapts the plan when the plan is clearly not working",
        "Uses humor to defuse tension without dismissing feelings",
        "Gives kids real input on decisions that affect them"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Not everything is a negotiation. Some boundaries need to just be boundaries, even when your kid makes a surprisingly compelling counterargument.",
      "encouragement": "Your kids are learning flexibility, creative problem-solving, and how to advocate for themselves — skills most adults still struggle with. The collaborative approach takes more energy upfront, but you're building people who can think on their feet.",
      "comparativeContext": "Studies find that collaborative problem-solving builds stronger executive function skills than either strict control or no structure at all."

      "themeColor": "#f59e0b",
      "description": "You believe your kids are capable of more than they think, and you're willing to push through the complaining to prove it. You don't set high expectations out of cruelty — you set them because you've watched your kid rise to a challenge and light up. You're playing the long game, even when today's battle is over ten minutes of piano practice.",
      "strengths": [
        "Sees potential in your kid that they haven't spotted yet",
        "Teaches persistence by actually requiring it",
        "Provides clear structure and routines that reduce daily chaos",
        "Invests serious time and energy into your kid's development"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "The line between 'pushing through resistance' and 'pushing past the point of diminishing returns' is real. Your kid's frustration is sometimes data, not just noise.",
      "encouragement": "Your kids are learning that effort leads somewhere, which is genuinely one of the most important things a person can internalize. The grit you're building doesn't come from nowhere — it comes from a parent who showed up and held the bar steady.",
      "comparativeContext": "Research shows high expectations paired with emotional support consistently predict academic achievement and resilience."

      "tagline": "Warmth first, always — your home runs on connection and trust.",
      "themeColor": "#a855f7",
      "description": "Your default setting is warmth, and your kids know they can come to you with anything. You'd rather preserve the relationship than win the argument, and your home feels like a genuinely safe place to land. Rules exist, but they bend when the situation calls for it — because you trust your read on what your kid actually needs in the moment.",
      "strengths": [
        "Creates a home where kids feel safe enough to be honest",
        "Picks up on emotional shifts before they become full meltdowns",
        "Prioritizes connection over control in high-stress moments",
        "Builds the kind of trust that keeps communication open long-term"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Warmth is your superpower, but kids also need to bump into firm limits sometimes. The discomfort of a boundary isn't the same as a broken relationship.",
      "encouragement": "The emotional safety you create is the foundation everything else gets built on. Kids who feel securely attached take more risks, recover faster from setbacks, and actually listen better — because they're not spending energy on anxiety. That warmth is doing more structural work than it looks like.",
      "comparativeContext": "Attachment research consistently finds that emotional warmth is the single strongest predictor of a child's willingness to accept guidance."

      "tagline": "Nurturing, protective, and tuned into every emotional frequency.",
      "themeColor": "#64748b",
      "description": "You lead with empathy and your instinct is to protect. You're the parent who notices the subtle mood shift after school, who creates rituals that make your kid feel anchored, and who will absolutely position yourself between your child and anything that threatens their wellbeing. Emotions get processed in your house — not shoved under the rug.",
      "strengths": [
        "Notices the quiet emotional signals other people miss",
        "Creates stability through routines and family rituals",
        "Models emotional processing instead of just demanding it",
        "Fiercely advocates for your child when the situation calls for it"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Protecting your kid from hard things and helping them through hard things aren't the same move. Sometimes the most nurturing thing is stepping back and letting them struggle a little.",
      "encouragement": "Your kids have a deep emotional vocabulary because you taught them feelings aren't dangerous. That's not soft — that's strategic. Emotionally literate kids navigate friendships, setbacks, and their own inner world with tools most people don't develop until their thirties.",
      "comparativeContext": "Emotion coaching research finds that kids whose parents help them label and process feelings show stronger social skills and stress regulation."
