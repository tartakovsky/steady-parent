      "description": "You're the parent your kid runs to when they want to build a fort or turn dinner into a picnic. You say yes to messes and adventures that make other parents nervous. Your kid thinks you're unpredictable in the best way.",
      "strengths": [
        "Your kid feels like childhood is something to enjoy, not just survive",
        "You model flexibility and creativity when things don't go according to plan",
        "Your willingness to play at their level builds connection that lasts through the hard years"

      "encouragement": "Your child will remember you as the parent who made childhood feel alive. That playfulness is a gift, and research links it to secure attachment and creative problem-solving. The calibration is making sure fun doesn't become the only mode you have when your kid needs you to be steady instead.",

      "strengths": [
        "Your predictability gives your kid genuine security — they never have to guess what version of you they'll get",

        "Your steady presence means your kid can take risks in other areas because home base feels safe"

      "growthEdge": "Predictability is your superpower until it becomes rigidity. When your kid needs you to bend, check whether the routine is serving them or protecting you.",
      "encouragement": "Consistency is underrated and undersupported in parenting culture. Your child knows they can count on you, and that foundation matters more than the flashy moments. The next step is learning when to hold the line and when to hold your kid instead.",

      "description": "You're the parent who explains everything. Why we don't hit, why sleep matters, why fairness is complicated. Your kid asks a question and you give them the full breakdown. They've learned that you turn simple requests into seminars.",
      "strengths": [
        "Your kid develops critical thinking skills because you teach them the why behind everything",

      "growthEdge": "Sometimes your kid needs a hug more than a lesson. Over-explaining can feel like a lecture when they just want you to get it without making them work for it.",
      "encouragement": "Your instinct to teach is rooted in respect — you believe your kid can handle real information, and you're right. The trick is reading when they're ready to learn and when they just need you to be present without turning it into an educational opportunity.",

      "growthEdge": "When you joke your way out of every hard moment, your kid may wonder if you can handle the serious stuff. Sometimes they need you to sit in the feeling instead of deflecting.",
      "encouragement": "Humor is a genuinely effective coping mechanism, and teaching your kid to find levity is a life skill. The balance is knowing when to crack the joke and when to hold space for the hard feeling without trying to fix it with a punchline.",
      "comparativeContext": "Parents who use humor in discipline report lower stress and stronger relationships, though effectiveness depends on kids perceiving it as connective, not dismissive."
