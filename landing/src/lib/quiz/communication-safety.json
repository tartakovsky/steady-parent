      "explanation": "When kids don't share, it's because sharing hasn't felt safe enough often enough. Maybe they've been lectured, dismissed, or punished for honesty. Maybe your response is unpredictable — sometimes empathetic, sometimes harsh. Either way, they've learned to manage feelings alone. The instinct is to push harder for connection, but interrogation makes guarded kids shut down further. What changes this is predictable, non-judgmental availability over time.",
      "nextSteps": [
        "Stop asking probing questions — guarded kids read that as interrogation. Start with low-stakes curiosity about neutral topics (what they're watching, what's funny at school).",
        "When they do share something (even tiny), respond with pure reflection: 'That sounds frustrating' or 'You seem excited about that.' No advice, no questions, no fixing.",
        "Repair one past rupture explicitly — pick a recent conflict and say 'I was too harsh when X happened. I'm sorry.' Don't expect a big response. Plant the seed.",
        "Create a daily 5-minute window of completely undivided attention with no agenda — not teaching, not correcting, just being there."
      ],
      "watchOutFor": "Closed loops don't open overnight. The temptation is to try a week of listening and then give up when nothing changes. Trust rebuilds slowly. Small, consistent safety over months beats one big conversation.",
      "encouragement": "This pattern didn't form overnight and it won't reverse overnight. But it can change. Start with one interaction this week where you listen without fixing, judging, or redirecting. Just that.",
      "comparativeContext": "Research on trust repair in parent-child relationships shows that consistent non-judgmental responses over 4-6 weeks can shift disclosure patterns even in highly guarded children. It's slow, but it works."
