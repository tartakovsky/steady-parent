      "themeColor": "#16a34a",
      "description": "You've got a unified front so consistent the kids can't find daylight between you. When one parent starts a consequence, the other backs it up without a word. Handoffs are seamless because you've talked it through enough.",
      "strengths": [
        "Kids get the same message from both parents, which builds security and clear boundaries",
        "Handoffs are smooth because you actually communicate what happened during your shift",

      "encouragement": "The consistency you've built is rare and valuable — kids thrive on it. Just remember that being on the same team doesn't mean you can't call an audible mid-play. The strongest partnerships adapt together.",

      "themeColor": "#3b82f6",
      "description": "You've carved up parenting by expertise. One of you owns bedtime, the other handles meltdowns or screen time. It works because you trust each other's lanes and don't second-guess mid-routine. The kids know who to go to for what.",
      "strengths": [
        "Each parent gets to be the expert in their zone, which builds confidence and competence",
        "Less negotiation in the moment — you've pre-decided who handles what",
        "Kids benefit from different strengths without the whiplash of conflicting rules"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "When your specialist isn't around, the other parent might flounder or just skip that routine entirely. And kids sometimes play the game of 'I'll ask the one who says yes.'",
      "encouragement": "Specialization is efficient, and it lets you both play to your strengths. Just make sure the backup plan exists — trade notes occasionally so neither of you is the only one who can execute bedtime or handle a tantrum.",
      "comparativeContext": "Most co-parents naturally drift toward some specialization, but balanced backup coverage predicts better outcomes when one parent is unavailable."

      "themeColor": "#e8c840",
      "description": "You've got different approaches and you're not shy about defending them. Sometimes you hash it out before the kid sees it. Sometimes the kid watches you negotiate in real time. You both believe in your methods, and the friction shows.",
      "strengths": [
        "You're both engaged and care enough to fight for what you think is right",
        "Kids see that disagreement doesn't mean the end of a relationship — conflict is normal",
        "When you do reach consensus, it's genuine, not one person caving"
      ],
      "growthEdge": "Debating in front of the kids — even 'respectfully' — undermines both of you. They learn to wait you out or play you against each other, and nobody wins that game.",
      "encouragement": "Your passion for getting it right is not the problem. The problem is location and timing. Get better at the pause — 'your mom and I need to talk about this' buys you the room to work it out without an audience.",

      "description": "You've got your rules, your co-parent has theirs, and the kids code-switch between houses like they're crossing a border. You don't coordinate much. Handoffs are transactional. What happened at the other house stays there.",

        "Low conflict because you're not trying to agree on everything",

      ],
      "growthEdge": "Kids don't just adapt — they also get confused, anxious, and sometimes manipulative. The lack of coordination makes discipline harder and gives them a playbook for playing you against each other.",
      "encouragement": "Parallel parenting works when cooperation isn't possible, but if it is, even minimal alignment helps. You don't have to parent identically. You just need to share the basics — bedtime, screen time, consequences — so the kids aren't living in two different rule books.",
      "comparativeContext": "High parental coordination predicts better child outcomes even in separated households, but parallel parenting with low conflict outperforms high-conflict co-parenting."
