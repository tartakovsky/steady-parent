      "explanation": "High scores across domains mean your child already shows you what works — through their behavior, not their words. Kids with clear regulation preferences respond faster to the right tools because their nervous system is already wired for that input. Your job is to formalize what's already happening and make those tools accessible before the meltdown hits peak.",

      "subheadline": "Your child shows moderate preferences across regulation channels — not locked into one type, which actually gives you room to experiment.",
      "explanation": "Mid-range scores usually mean one of two things: your child uses a mix of strategies inconsistently, or they haven't had enough exposure to find their primary channel yet. Either way, the path forward is structured experimentation. Try specific tools from each domain and track what actually works versus what you wish would work.",

      ],
      "watchOutFor": "Don't confuse \"hasn't found it yet\" with \"nothing works.\" Kids in this range often need 10-15 exposures to a strategy before it becomes a usable tool. Most parents give up after 2-3 tries.",
      "encouragement": "A mixed profile is actually an advantage — your child has more pathways into calm than a kid who can only use one channel. The work is narrowing down, not building from nothing.",

      "explanation": "Low scores across all domains mean your child's self-regulation system is still under construction. This isn't a failure — it's a developmental stage. Kids under 5 are neurologically incapable of consistent self-regulation, and many older kids simply haven't been taught specific strategies. The biggest mistake here is assuming they should already know how to calm down.",
