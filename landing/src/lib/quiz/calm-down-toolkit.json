    "intro": "Self-regulation isn't something children are born with — it's a skill they build over years. Some kids calm down through movement, others through stillness. Some need connection first, others need space.\n\nThis quiz helps you see how developed your child's self-regulation toolkit is right now, and what strategies will actually work for them — not just what worked for someone else's kid.",
