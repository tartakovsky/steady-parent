        "Run a structured experiment: pick one channel per week and try three different strategies within it, noting any flicker of response",
        "Focus entirely on co-regulation first — your calm presence is the strategy while you figure out their specific channels",
        "Try strategies during calm moments, not crises — you can't discover what works when the nervous system is fully offline",
        "If no channel shows any response after 4-6 weeks of experimentation, talk to your pediatrician about an occupational therapy screening",
        "Read the domain descriptions below for specific strategies to test in each channel"

      "watchOutFor": "Low scores don't mean your child is broken or that you're failing. It usually means their regulation profile is specific enough to benefit from more targeted exploration — or professional guidance.",
      "encouragement": "The fact that nothing has clicked yet doesn't mean nothing will. It means you need a more systematic approach than 'try deep breathing.' The channel framework gives you that structure. Start with whichever domain scored highest, even if it's low.",
      "comparativeContext": "About one in five parents report that standard calming strategies don't work for their child. In most cases, the issue is fit rather than ability — the right channel just hasn't been identified yet."
