# NMP Landing Brainstorm

# General online buying questions to cover

## Awareness

- “Do I see the problem?’
- By the end they realize a problem, desire, or gap exists.

Steps

- Attract attention
- Show the problem (relatably)
- Show them possibility
- Ends with smth like “What if X?”

Do we use micro-narrative storytelling here?

## Consideration

- Do I believe there’s a solution?
- By the end they realize solutions exist and begin comparing options.

Steps

- Show the solution
- Educate very shortly
- Build trust (how if testimonials are the next stage?)

## Evaluation

- “Do I trust YOUR solution?”
- “Is this person the one I want to learn from/work with?”

do we separate “establish authority” and “establish trust”? Do they happen in different places on the landing?

## Recognition + Permission
