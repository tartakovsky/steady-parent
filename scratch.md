Well, hello, everybody! Welcome here to a very special thing. We have got a bunch of things to talk about today. Before, we get started with this very intense workshop, basically, where I'm gonna show you everything you need to know in order to grow an actual personal brand.
as an artist or creative from scratch, or, yeah, wherever you're at right now, basically. Now, if you're here, if you can hear me, first of all.
type a 1 in the chat box down below, and second of all, make sure to say TO EVERYONE, because I can still see everybody has two hosts and panelists, so I see a bunch of ones, but you need to switch this to field to everyone. So…
So far, nobody did it.
People say you can't change it.
You guys can't change it? Wait a minute.
Change it again. Now try to change it.
I just changed something.
There you go, now we've got… we have a bunch of ones.
Well, I mean, I didn't say 2, so that's the only choice you had. Anyway, so let's actually not even waste your time, let's get right into it. We have some very… some very intense
prepared for you. Something I can guarantee you've never heard before, and yeah, something that's gonna change everything, the way you approach content, and the way you actually grow as an artist or creative.
Right now, going forward, because things have changed, right? The whole content industry is in a crazy massive shift right now, and frankly, most advice, even
including some of my own, you know, from some time ago, just doesn't work anymore. And honestly, this whole thing is unfair, especially for artists and creatives, because social media was not really built for artists, if you think about it, right? It kind of was built because
because of marketers, and for people just marketing their stuff, right? People selling information, courses, and stuff like this, which is not a bad thing, obviously, but it's…
inherently harder, to be honest, as a creative, as an artist, to make things work on social media, because if you think about it, a fitness coach can basically just say, well, here are 5 exercises for… to get apps, right? And the algorithm knows exactly who it's for and what this whole thing is about, right? Clear problem, clear solution.
distribution is pretty much taken care of, because the algorithm's smart, right? For artists, kind of, and creatives, it's a completely different game, right? And actually, nobody talks about that.
And, honestly, it's a little bit of a shame, because some of my successful clients that I've been working with, over the past almost… actually a decade, which is insane, actually, some of the most successful ones are artists and creatives, right? And,
The thing that I want you to understand is that it's not that social media doesn't work for artists, because it wasn't built for artists, it's just that this generic sort of crappy advice
Doesn't work generally, but especially for artists and creatives.
it's even harder for those, right? Because they're… you probably know it yourself. There's so many individual elements that come together. But, yeah, so before we get started, first of all, drop a 1 here if it's the first time ever you, you've been to one of my, workshops.
Number one, that's a good little bunch of ones. Okay, drop a 2, I wanna know who's been here before.
2, we see a bunch of twos.
Cool.
Now, the ones previously were less geared towards artists and more geared towards business owners.
The ones who say 2,
Let me know, what are you? Would you consider yourself an artist? Bethany says the last webinar was a game changer for me. I love it! Awesome, so let's hope this one's gonna be even better.
Because we got something going on. Okay. So, cool. Also, where are you from? I'd just love to know.
Let me know, your…
You know what that means. We have even Austria, Martina from Austria, look at that!
I'm originally from there as well.
NYC, Turkey, Montana, Portugal, France, Italy.
VA.
Which VA? Virginia?
I was just there.
A few months ago. France, Portugal. Again, Portugal, Germany, lots of Austria, interesting. London also was just there. Filmmaker from Canada, awesome. Italy, India, Berlin, Canada, DC, also was just there, obviously, because, yeah. Anyway, Florida, Justin Hirschberg, you sound like…
You sound like you could be from Germany or Austria. I'll be in Florida!
In 3, 4 weeks, or something like that. So, anyway. With that being said, let's actually get right into this whole thing, because I don't want you to kind of…
you know, missed the boat, and I want you to succeed here. So, before we get into everything here today, I need you to ask something.
You know, and I kinda…
want you to be honest, don't… you don't need to post it in the chat, honestly, I just lost the chat somewhere there. But, you know, just be honest with yourself, right? Just in your head.
How many of you have posted something you were really genuinely proud of?
let's say a piece of art, a song, a video, or something, you really put a lot of creative energy into it, and then you watch it get 47 likes, right? From the same 47 people that you always get, including your mother, and 38 of your cousins.
Well, I'm just saying that because it kind of happened to me back in the days.
And then you basically go look at your Explore page, or, you know, the Reels feed, or whatever, and you see people with just 1% of your talent get 10% of your reach, probably even 50% of your reach, right? I'm sure this has happened quite a lot before.
You know, like I said, halves happen to me.
More than once. And here's the part that nobody really says out loud.
at some point, maybe you've started to even wonder whether the stuff that you create, whether it's the art or whatever it is, is actually, you know, really as good as you thought, right? Because if it were, wouldn't people be finding it? Wouldn't the algorithm just find them?
ways, because the algorithm, you probably always hear me talk about it, well, the algorithms are becoming smart.
Yeah, but if that sounds remotely familiar, that's exactly why you're here, and this is why I built this workshop specifically, for creatives here, because I feel like nobody's ever talked about creatives.
You know, and… You know, in the scope that…
that's needed, let's put it that way, right? Because here's what's up, this whole feeling that you might have just had has nothing to do with your art itself. It has everything to do with the fact that nobody ever taught artists anything how the game actually works on social media, right? And I mean actually works, not the guru advice of…
well, you need to post more, right? Or you need to…
you know, the hooks, obviously, and be consistent, and stuff like this. Yeah, generic advice, yeah, let's forget that. Today, I'll show you what actually matters, my friends. So,
Quick context, if you have no idea who I am, maybe…
you know, let's… let's hope you have no idea who I am, but basically, I've been in the whole Instagram and content game for more than a decade right now. I was just talking to Florian today, I was like, I'm getting old, it's crazy. Times are really going fast.
You know, and my clients have actually generated over 12 billion views combined over the past decade, 2 billion, actually, in the past 2 years, and I've worked with artists
who went from completely unknown to working alongside huge names. You probably all have heard one, just to name one, would be a female recording artist who rhymes with the word Shaddell.
If you know what I mean. You know, people getting record deals, brand deals, working with crazy brands, selling out collections, multiple artists and creatives actually getting booked to festivals, Tomorrowland.
You know, the creator mentorship, basically, my mentorship
Tomorrowland was… I feel like we've had, like, 5 or 6 people there. Coachella, as well, Burning Man, right? And we've had so many people building audiences in the hundreds of thousands, which is awesome, and just going through this whole list of people that have worked with us
You know, I get goosebumps, right? Because that's what I burn for. But here's the thing. For years, all of this, you know, me helping people.
that was one-on-one work, right? Every single time, you know, I've helped person… some… an artist, for example, obviously, you know, with the individual nature and stuff like this, was all one-on-one. And every time I created…
post a video, even right now, you know? People in the comments and DMs, they were like, well, cool, right? But do you have anything for us artists, right? Do you have anything for us creatives and not just businesses, right? And the honest answer was always.
Not really, apart from the 101. Until now. We'll get to that a little later. But,
You know, until now, actually being today. But, here's the thing, actually. With that being said.
I'll show you!
First of all, the system, the actual system on how social media works for artists, specifically, again, not the recycled advice from business coaches, not that there's anything wrong with that, you know, a big chunk of people I work with are actually business coaches, but the mechanics are totally different for you guys, right? And then at the end, I have a very, very special announcement.
For everyone who's here live, only if you're here live, so…
You know? Make sure to stay, right?
So, with that being said, here's the thing I need you to hear before.
you hear anything else from me today, and this might be kind of uncomfortable a little bit for you, for some of you, but it's actually the most important thing I can tell you.
As part of this.
Arts?
And whatever creative output that you have and content are not the same thing at all, right?
Art is your expression, it's sort of a sacred thing, and whatever that is, right? The range is big, obviously. It's your internal thing that you come up with, and it's the thing that you make because you have to make it, right? Because you're creative, I know what it's like. And nobody gets to tell you what… how to do it, and what that is, obviously, because otherwise it wouldn't be art.
Now, the content isn't…
kind of related to that, but it has not too much to do with the art itself, right? The content is just the translation, basically, a strategic way into how you take what you create and package it, so the platform and the people on it actually understand why they should care, and to then, you know, as a result of that, get interested in whatever
Art.
That you have, right? And here's what most creators actually do. They post their art, or whatever they have, and they expect the algorithms to do their things, distribution, right? They expect views and stuff like this.
Basically, they put the painting on the wall, like beautiful Mona Lisa here.
But, you know, they assume people are gonna find the gallery, but let's just say you put Mona Lisa in some weird cabin in the middle of the woods without even a window or a door, and you just leave it there, and you just be like, well, that's… it's a masterpiece. Debatable, but let's just say it's a masterpiece.
Somebody's gotta find it, right?
And that's basically what a lot of artists do, and creatives do. And,
You know, for example, a song, right, can be super awesome, incredible, but nobody's gonna care, because we, first of all, need to find a way to stand out.
Kind of without looking like a desperate artist, because that's the other thing I've seen a lot of people talk about, they're like, yeah, I know I need to promote myself, and I need to kind of create content, but I don't want to look like, you know, this desperate person, right? And,
That way.
basically is actually translating your art, your creations, into content that works, right? Being a successful content creator, a successful creative on social media, is actually 50% art, but 50% science, right?
Right? And if you just have one of these two down, you are not going to succeed, right? And I really want to be…
really real with you here, today.
this whole thing, this whole social media game is a lot harder for artists than it is for almost anyone else on the platform, right? The consultant, for example, can just say, well, here's how to get more… or I can just say, well, here's how to get more followers, for example, and that is my content, right? That literally is the content. But for you.
it's… there's tension right there, because you need to create content to then only get people to see whatever you create, whatever you do, right? And it's a very personal thing, if you think about it, and I understand why some people might be even afraid of putting art out there, in a way. And, obviously, if you're, like, right now, okay.
Dominic, you're gonna show me how the game works, so people find me, so people become fans and followers, long-term followers, right?
Cool, but, you know, one thing I want you to kind of preface this, I'm not gonna sit here and basically tell you to turn your stuff into clickbait, right? Or dancing around like a monkey, or following trends and stuff like this, right? That's not what it is. The goal here is to basically learn the rules.
as well enough to play the game without selling your soul, right? Because, you know, you know what it's like, right? So…
With that being said, let me tell you a little story about how I actually figured this whole thing out, right? Because it didn't come from nothing. It actually started way earlier than you might think, because I was, in some sense, I still am, somewhat of an artist myself, right? If you just look…
There's always some sort of guitar or piano around somewhere. I'm not gonna play, but I'm just gonna put this here, just because, you know, I also have the ick in me for lots of different stuff.
Right?
And,
You know, I had a band, and this is gonna lead us somewhere important, right? So listen, pay close attention. Let me just delete this right there. But when I was a teenager, right, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, I had a band, right? And I thought we were great.
We… honestly, I think we're pretty good. But nobody really cared. And by the way, I'm not gonna check the comments right now, we're gonna have a Q&A towards the end, so don't worry about it.
But nobody really cared, and I remember we got booked to one show, and I remember one night, not a single person showed up, and I was like, well, I have to…
three awesome songs that I wrote, right? Nobody showed up, what the hell is going on, right? And it was super awkward. It was still people there, obviously, the people working there, but that was kind of awkward, right?
M… Yeah, love ducks, obviously, obviously, not love sucks. I was not being edgy at all.
But yeah, so anyway, back in the days, obviously, there was the band era, and there's hundreds of bands like us, and, you know, just trying to get noticed, right? Social media itself was not really a thing, it was just starting out. My space just started to be a thing.
And we couldn't get any traction, as…
Most people do, right? Or did.
And one day, I actually asked myself the question that changed literally everything for me. This is the reason why I'm here right now. I was like, well, why do I even care about my favorite bands and artists? Because you can see Nirvana in the background, some other… I was like, well, some of them, I really feel like I have a connection.
Right?
me, for example, with bands, other people with, with, you know, visual art, or with, with paintings, or with, you know, DIY, whatever it is, right? So…
Back then, my favorite band was actually a band called Blink-182. Type in there in the chat if you know, if you've heard about them, if you've heard about them back in the days. But back in the days, their newest album just came out, which for me is still the newest album, but it came out in 2003.
But they actually, back then, they did something nobody else was doing yet, right? They actually posted these little mini-vlogs on, not even… YouTube was not a thing, on their website.
Before vlogs were even a word, right? Basically, behind-the-scenes clips every few days when they were recording this album. I think they even had a livestream on their website.
In the studio, right? And I've basically was there, just following the process every single day.
you know, seeing them work in the studio, arguments, I've seen, I've had some arguments, the jokes, right? And I remember watching these, and suddenly, I kind of really felt like I was part of this. They were so far away, somewhere in San Diego, and you know, but I was just…
I knew them. I felt like I knew them, right? I knew everybody was making fun of Travis.
the drummer, he's apparently now with the Kardashians or something like this, and I knew that Tom, right, the guitar player, was the weird one making all these dick jokes, which, obviously, when you're 14, that's the greatest content ever, right? So I was like, cool! And,
They actually had a stage with a giant fuck sign that was on fire. Now, 14-year-old me thought that was pretty edgy, right? And all the stuck-up people, they were like, well, did they really do that right now, right? They can't do this, this is, like, a horrible thing, let me just drink something really quickly.
And, actually, here's what happened to me back then without realizing this whole thing at the time.
I started caring about Blink-182,
Way, way more, and this is why they became my favorite band, because of that, because I cared about them first, right? The behind the scenes, the personality, the feeling like I was in on a joke.
That's what really made me become an actual fan, and I still am. I was just on a show, like, a year ago or something, right? And it's not just because the songs alone, because there's way other, like.
Probably better bands as well. But the song, if you… to kind of bring this back home to make you understand, the songs are the art.
But everything else around it, including this fuck sign that's still right here.
was, you know, the content, basically, the translation. And here's the other thing. It kind of filtered their audience perfectly, right? My friend's parents, who were lawyers, and they were, like, stuck up.
people, parents, right? They didn't want him to listen to Blink-182 anymore because of this, right? Which is exactly…
Perfect, this is what they wanted, right? Dissecting their audience, and this is basically what understanding your audience really does. That's actually the layer that I always talk about in my videos, where I'm like, you need to know who you actually create content for, right?
Because Blink didn't try to appeal to anyone, obviously. They knew exactly who their people were. They made content, right? Not just music.
But content that made those specific people
feel like they belonged, right? Like, they found… I finally found my… where my energy can go towards, right? So when I tell you now and later today that you need to understand your audience's fears, desires, frustrations, and stuff like this, this is exactly what I mean for artists, right? If you're an artist or a creative, right?
Blink knew their audience was 14-year-old rebels, obviously. He wanted to feel like they were part of something, and…
who hated teachers, or whatever it is, and parents didn't approve of them. And everything they did outside of their art reinforced that, right? Everything. The music was the art, everything else was how they made people care, right? Of course, pop-punk music is…
You know, debatable whether that is a high form of art or something like this, but, you know, a special kind of art form, let's put it that way. But the same principles apply, because that's, after all, human psychology, right? And this is actually what makes the whole artist-slash-creative part different.
Cause Blink didn't…
you know, tried to write songs for an algorithm. Obviously, there was no algorithms back then, but I get… I hope you get what I mean, right? They didn't stop making the music they actually wanted to make, just to try to appeal to someone. They kept being themselves, right? The jokes, the sign and stuff like this.
They just learn how to translate that all into something people connect with on a separate level, if you will, right?
That's the line, right? The small line, and that line is really everything. Somebody's asking, does it mean we should have more behind-the-scenes content? We'll talk about this in a second, don't worry about it.
And once I kind of thought, figured this out for myself, usually, actually, this untitled album of Blink-182 actually did the same thing with my own band.
I started making these little local, sort of, vlogs on Myspace, because I was just a very small-minded person, I'm actually not that smart, and I wanted to just be known locally in my small-ass cow hometown. So I started making these vlogs, and actually, I called them
Diaries, which was like a blog just written with some pictures. I didn't know what a blog was, didn't come through to me. And yeah, I was just basically being myself.
And, suddenly people started showing up to our shows, and suddenly I was on the big stage, right? And that was, by the way, this is also, this is me here, right in the center, with a… it's actually a Beatles t-shirt.
That got stolen to me that day.
Some chick stole it off of me, and it's gone. I've been trying to find this, because I can… I can't find this shirt, generally, to buy it again. But anyway. So, that was my sort of first taste of what content can actually do as an artist.
Right? To connect with people, and to do something that's kind of connected, but not really, and suddenly people like what you actually do.
So I was like, that is something interesting. Now, obviously, that was 17, 18 years ago, and you know, some things obviously have changed. My space is gone, which is the worst, saddest thing ever, still, for me. But the core principles haven't changed.
And over the past 9 years, I've basically dialed this whole thing, iterated it 100 times over, and turned it into a system. So let me actually show you what happens when people nowadays, from the actual times.
Apply basically the same system.
So, first of all.
This here is Consty, and he actually has, as you can see, over 800,000 followers right now.
Which is insane, if you think about it. And, obviously that didn't happen for no reason, right? He basically came to me a few years ago, without a profile, literally nothing. He just had a camera, and he knew, well, I want to showcase my art, my pictures, and because that's what I like. Very young guy, cool.
And,
He's like, well, I just want to take people on my journey, right? Taking a look at all these pictures and stuff like this. Now, generally speaking, artists, right, photographers and stuff like this, they're like, okay, my art, this is…
let's say a picture like this. A bloody…
What is that? A cheetah, or something like this? Or lions, or like a… giraffe.
Yeah, we're… I'm teaching you how these things are called.
But yeah, people, they're like, okay, this is what it is, I just need to show my beautiful…
lion picture, or cheetah picture, and… because it's so beautiful, people are gonna come and love it, but nobody is gonna be interested. Because nobody cares. Because nowadays, anything out there is a dime a dozen.
Because everyone can do everything they want, plus the whole AI thing comes along, where I can literally generate this.
And, so people are not even sure anymore whether it's real or not. Point being.
people just don't care. Nobody's interested in just the pure craft. Whether that's a photo, whether that's a…
Song or, you know, something. Anything.
Right?
And, this is actually a screenshot from back when he had 275 followers, whoop.
Nope, not there. 275 followers, and
From one of her coaching sessions, right?
If you look here, trying out a bunch of stuff, 76 views on a video,
also here, like, already trying out some stuff, but nobody really, really cared, right? And basically what we did…
To change that and figure out to, you know, help him grow to now over 800,000 followers.
It was the most important first principle for everyone right here.
Was doing market research and understanding what's even going on around in my niche, in adjacent niches.
what do people think of, and what do people… like, how do people consume content, right? What is the groove of my platform, right? And before you're right now, before you're like, right now, well, I'm just gonna run away, let me just exit out here, you know? I'll tense up, because market research sounds like you want me to be a marketer.
or something very dry. It is actually not. And it's actually one of the two key ingredients how
We've managed to blow up artists and creatives.
from all around the world, basically. So, let me show you how to do that in a very simple way, because one thing I want to make you clear
Most things are not that complex, right? People always kind of try to make it sound and feel complex.
No, actually not. We can break it down, it's a very simple few steps. So, because most people, creators, they basically just post and pray. They sometimes post randomly, let me know in the comments if you're one of those people.
basically just show whatever you create, your art, and hope just something sticks. And sometimes something might get a little bit more views, but, you know, trying to do the same thing over and over again sometimes, because something gets a little more views.
But you can't, right? And then you kind of paint yourself in this weird corner, and it's kind of strange, right? And a lot of…
the times artists and creatives actually hear the term market research, and they're like, but I'm not… I don't need to do that. That's for businesses, right? That's for other… that's for marketers, and I'm not.
But I don't want you to think of market research as this sort of technical term. I want you to think of it just as pattern recognition, right? Just basically take a look at what's going on, study and take a look at what gets attention, and then think about why.
That's essentially it, right? Not to copy it, that's really important, especially nowadays, especially as creatives, you don't want to copy somebody, but you want to understand, basically, the language the platform speaks, and your audience speaks. We're gonna get to that in a second.
Because…
You're not gonna research to just basically drown your voice in the sea of the same same. You're basically researching to figure out how to stand out and make your stuff get seen.
Just made this… Yeah.
So, Think of it… This way.
let's say you're a musician, and you never studied or thought about why certain songs go viral on Reels, and then equally good songs, or even
You know, worse songs, or a lot better songs, actually die
totally in silence, leaving your growth entirely to chance, right? And we don't want chance, because chance doesn't grow. And a lot of artists that come to me, musicians, whatever.
That's what they do.
Because a lot of it is chance and coincidence, and we can't predict chance, and we can't really work with that, right? So we need to figure out a way to make things, at least the one… the some things that we can influence, to, yeah, to work with that in a predictable way. And,
I can already hear you talk about that, probably, when I said it before, about, you know, understand what's going on in your niche, with your audience and stuff like this, and a lot of you, probably, right now, are gonna be like, well, niche, what does that even mean for me? Right? Does it mean…
My niche is people like art, or people like photography, or crocheting, or, you know, or anyone who appreciates creativity. That's a lot… what a lot of people think.
And a lot of gurus tell you that, actually, when they try to help artists and stuff like this. But we actually need to go a lot deeper than that.
Because the people who, you know, like music, or people who like illustration, right, that's basically saying, well, my audience is everybody who has two ears, right? It makes no sense at all, obviously. So what I need you to figure out is.
What?
About your creativity.
resonates with your specific audience, right? Is it breaking free from certain expectations? Is it a certain lifestyle that you have?
It literally can't be anything, we'll get to that in a second, but remember my Blink-182 example, right? Young, feisty teenagers, wannabe rebels.
You know, who need music to sort of release all this anger or tension inside, you know, our bodies as part of growing up, right? That's the level of detail, the level of understanding I want you to think of. And suddenly, just knowing, you know, that we basically have…
A sort of profile of a very specific Peer group.
person, actually. So we can target
use this information, targeted both with their hooks, with content, and with everything revolving around that, right? And suddenly, it's far from generic, right? It's basically a way in to open up the whole art to everyone else.
So… Think of it as this way.
Figure out what specifically about your art resonates with people, right? Do research, ask people who like it already, right? If nobody likes it, yeah, it doesn't matter, just…
try to figure it out yourself, and also think about why does it resonate, and also with whom. What are the things? And we're not talking about, oh, they live in…
In South America, in Buenos Aires, for example, and it's an 18-year-old boy. No, it depends, it totally… it's, like, more than that, deeper than that. Remember the example from before?
People that are angry, or people that, you know.
love to enjoy certain things. You get what I mean. Basically, psychographics being the key word.
And this is actually what we need for the next really important part, because only if we know what they're really into, right, sort of on the meta level, we can then go out and basically reverse engineer the algorithms.
And platforms to see how you can come in as an artist and create content that resonates with this type of audience.
Okay? So, let's go back to the example from earlier, Consty. Back in the days, you just had 275 followers, and I asked him, okay, so, who's your audience?
And who are your competitors?
And he actually said, well, It's people who like nature and photography.
Duh.
No shit, right?
probably… you understand what I'm trying to say right now, because that's… people who like nature and photography, that is not an audience, right? Because that is half the planet.
Essentially
And, I actually had him give me what he thought was his competitors, right? Big accounts in his niche, where he was like, okay, this is… this is what other people like.
And, you know, wildlife photography accounts and stuff like this. And, we saw basically a bunch of very high follower accounts that basically just showed the craft, just the art. And some of them had some followers, but even this one, 3.9 million followers, I remember some of the videos, I think we have it even there.
They had 3,000 views, 7,000 views. Some of them had some breakout stuff, if we look here at this, Bambi, or whatever that is.
So, yeah.
basically, they were just showing the craft. That's what I'm kind of… I wanna say.
But again, even if, like, honestly, those were 10 out of 10 pictures, but even back then, I wouldn't remember the name of the account 3 seconds after I saw it.
So, here's where it gets interesting, though, and here's where I want you to listen, because that's going to change the game.
We found some outliers, like this one.
1.8 million views.
and we kind of took a look at, and this is what I want you to do as well, take a look at adjacent content in your niche.
Other type of content that's in your tar… popular, or that resonates with your target audience. And don't just look at the videos that are sort of breaking up, but also take a look at the comments.
Basically, what are people saying, right? What's going on? And we could kind of spot the first gap right there.
Which basically, everybody wanted to know more about the process, right? The emotional side of things were very, very heavy. We saw this in some other pieces of content.
People are like, I want to understand how you got that shot, like, what happened? Were you lying 6 hours in the mud when you took a picture of that lion or something like that? Did the Bambi run away? Where's the mother? Right?
So, again, basically just an extension of the art, right? Sounds familiar from right before the Blink-182 example? You're gonna dream of Blink-182 tonight.
Again, the art was the photo, but the content was everything else around it. So, basically, I had to constantly create those process-oriented videos, the storytelling, showcasing the art in a slightly different way.
you know, just a small fun fact. I just recently built a you know, custom AI.
For our clients, where you can basically pull in a video, and…
it analyzes all the comments, and it figures out, well, what do people actually love about this, and what else do people want? Now, point being, obviously, you can and should do this by hand, but point being, suddenly he started creating bangers like this. Five animals your grandchildren will never believe once existed.
Slightly triggering, very emotional, right? Small part that we figured out, well, the emotional side of things get a little more views. How can we include emotional storytelling in the art?
And, yeah, obviously, this one blew up like crazy. He actually blew up to, I think, you know, 100,000 followers within, like, 3 weeks, but actually, the process of
you know, growing happened within 3-4 days, which was insane, because we figured it out, this… this formula, that obviously is way different for everyone, and there's a different form, there's 100 different formulas, but yeah.
Now, obviously, there's just a lot of people who, you know, like to look… at a lion, right? But…
what actually matters for people who get moved by wildlife photography, it's, you know, the people that actually care and actually go beyond just enjoying a picture, right?
you get what I'm trying to say here. And this is exactly what I want you to do after this workshop.
Today.
Basically, figure out what your niche really is in terms of your audience, right? It can take a while, and it should.
You know, what really gets it moving, and why? And then, I want you to take a look at
Instagram, and some of the content in your niche, or similar niches, and yeah, basically, look for three things. First of all, what formats can you find that people just repeat over and over again, right? It can be small things like that. Also, what themes basically keep repeating.
And then, basically, I want you to kind of ask yourself, what is the gap nobody else is doing?
or what are some people doing from an adjacent niche that nobody else in my niche is actually doing? And, you know, what's the angle that I can bring to the table right here, right? What are you really good at that nobody's good at? And, you know, for Consty, obviously, we figured it out just in the comments of…
Looking at his own niche.
And, we saw, well, nobody was really doing that, and he was into that. So, the behind-the-scenes emotional storytelling process. For you, it might be something totally different, right?
But the gap is always there. There's always some sort of gap, and finding it, just this one thing, basically, is what took Consty from literally zero, when he started to work with us, to now over 800,000 followers.
And being basically the person they copy now, and the creator they look up for.
Up to.
Now… Once we have that, it's time for step 2.
Because once you understand your niche, you need to actually understand what the algorithm actually rewards, and that's a little bit different for every audience. Because, the thing I see a lot, especially when creatives come to work with me.
Most artists have this completely wrong, because the algorithm is not scattering your content into the wind, basically hoping it finds the right people, that's what you might believe, that's what a lot of gurus say, but it's actually testing it.
It shows a reel to a very small group first, and then it measures 3 things.
First of all,
very fast attention, right? People… did people stop scrolling, obviously, in the first half second? We'll talk about this. Obviously, the hook.
We'll talk about this. I'll show you…
An example from you, actually, from some of you who's here, like, right now, live, to show you what you did right or wrong.
And this is where you're either overthinking it or not thinking about it at all. The second piece here is you need some sort of clear emotional signal, especially as a creative and as an artist. You need…
part of the formula, which I'm gonna talk about in a second, basically instant clarity plus a curiosity gap, because the viewer needs to immediately know what this is about, and then they want more, no more, and then the third thing, the algorithm actually takes a look at, obviously, engagement signals.
Rewatches, but also things like, does somebody pause? Does somebody share? When does somebody share or like?
And, here's actually…
something that I think nobody ever talks about, and it's… artists especially need to hear this right now, and creatives, obviously.
originality is not a ranking factor. Muziri, the head of Instagram, he's always like, well, you know, we prefer original content, but that has nothing to do with originality in terms of the formats and stuff like this, right? The algorithm rewards originality as part of
you being clear, right? Familiar, and basically, you know.
clear what and who this is for, in terms of the context. That's the most important thing. And,
That's… that actually doesn't mean that you have to sell out, right? Or copy other people. It's just packaging your unique value in a way that's instantly understood.
From your target audience, by your target audience.
Because the most original, awesome art will… in the world will die at 200 views if nobody can figure out what it is in the first half second. And that's…
Literally, The one thing 99% of you guys probably
do wrong. And I want to show you an example right here. Because,
It's all in the hooks, and if you can just take away one thing today, hooks. Doesn't matter what you do, if the hook is bad, nothing else will work, and…
If you go online, if you go to Instagram or YouTube, and there's other gurus who are like, well, use these hook swipe lists, and download this, and just recreate these hooks, and it's gonna work for you as well. Obviously, that's not how it works. That's 2025 thinking.
In 2026, hooks work when they hit something inside your viewer, right? A fear, desire, some sort of emotion, like we said.
And two things, like I kind of hinted before, need to happen in the first half second. First of all, the instant clarity part, and we'll break this down in a second. And if you've heard me talk about this already before.
hang in there, because there's a little bit of a twist for creative people right here. So, first of all, people, within the first half second need to know, okay, this is really
First of all, for me, and they need to know what this is about. So, relevancy and context.
And that it actually caters to whatever they're into. And then the second thing is, you need a curiosity gap. So basically, they understand enough here that they actually care and have a question in their minds.
They need to know something, right? And the important thing right here is that a hook, and really, listen right now, a hook
is not showcasing whatever art or creation you have. Because at this point, people do not care. Doesn't matter if you're the best person ever, even big artists and known artists, when they start to work, or put their work out on social media, and nobody knows them yet on the internet, basically.
they don't get views. I've had multiple major players come to me, and yeah, they were like, well, I'm on TV and everything's working well, but on social media, nothing really works, right? Because nobody cares. Because there's so much content out there, especially on the internet, and you just compete with everything else out there. With MrBeast, with…
Cat videos, chicken dance, which is what I love the most, but yeah.
So, you really need to approach every piece of content Like this going forward.
Basically, like people don't know or don't care. Doesn't matter if you're… The president.
Well, that's a weird example, but you get what I mean. Now, with that being said, first of all, is a certain Susan, or Suzanne here?
from, I believe, Australia.
Because to make you guys really understand this whole thing, I took some of you, because you all signed up here, hopefully you're here. Susan, let me know if you're here. If not, I'm very sad. But, yeah, we're gonna show you anyway.
But, basically, she's a fashion designer from Australia.
Now, let me just open this right here.
There you go. Made It. It's kind of a cool name, very…
Smart. But let's just take this reel here.
For example.
Oh, Susan! Or Susan, you're here, awesome, I love it. So, let's just show the video, and
basically, let's take a look. What's right and what's wrong? And then I'll show you a different example of basically the same thing, just done the right way, right? Because I want you to really understand what's going on, not just abstract concepts. So, first of all, let's listen and let's take a look. 7-second, very short reel.

Okay, so…
heyDominik
heyDominik
00:47:15
The thing is that she's a fashion designer, Cool stuff, by the way.
And, if we pull this whole thing through our formula that we just talked about, right? The instant clarity, the curiosity gap, we can actually see that some things are missing, right? Especially if we go here.
There is a text hook, but the text hook is very overloaded. There's so many things going on at the same time.
And, so people have no idea, what is this really going on? What is really going on there? Second of all, this already kind of looks just like an ad, like an actual advertisement, basically.
And…
With that being said, the only thing that's clear, brought to life with Made It, so that's the… that's the line that kind of comes out to me, so my brain is instantly like, okay, this together with this is an ad.
So I'm gonna swipe away because I don't care right now. You could be the best…
Ever. And, I wouldn't care, right? So, missing.
Now, the shot itself is actually pretty interesting. I like the way it's made, also…
some interesting stuff there, some small pattern interrupts. But, like I said, nobody's gonna care, because, yeah, people don't like ads, and people don't understand why they should actually care. And then…
Once people take a look at it,
And they're like, okay, let me read everything. Your favorite print, reborn, okay, also reads like an ad.
Here, as well.
100% ad, so people are gonna be gone. And this is why it has 4 likes. And it's really interesting what the,
what the stats look like. So, Susan, if you could just tell me, if you can, go inside your stats, and tell me the skip rate, if you have it, or the retention graph, you can also drop it in here, you don't have to, but the skip rate would be the most important thing to know.
Because my guess is most people just… they instantly swiped away.
Right?
Now, with that being said, I'm just gonna wait a second.
But,
The major point I want you to understand here is, this is not Susan's fault at all, right? Because this is what 99% of artists do that work… that come to work with me, that I've taken a look at.
Basically, if you make something beautiful, something awesome, which it is, And…
you know, you go, well, here it is, because obviously, that's how you were conditioned to be, that's how it used to be back in the days, but times have changed.
You know, and especially on the platform, people look at this and they're like, who cares? Because, well, I don't have a reason to even feel some sort of emotional attachment or interest.
for whatever that is, right? So, let me actually show you, now, a second thing, when a fashion designer actually does this and gets this whole thing right.
Because…
Let's compare this to one of the people I actually worked with, which is Anna. Anna, let me know if you're here.
Maybe. But it's basically the same…
type of person. A fashion designer, just in a little bit of a different niche, but it's actually the same fashion designer. And,
she's, yeah, doing a bunch of great things. And the funny thing is, she basically creates ads without them looking like ads, so it's even basically a similar video than what… as what Susan did, just spun in a slightly different way, so that people actually care.
Right? So, I'm actually gonna show you two examples, because the first one being, and one of the first ones that actually did well.
And it's very similar to this one, it's just an ad.
10 seconds long, and let's just first of all look at it.

What!
Love, one love, one love, one location.
heyDominik
heyDominik
00:51:28
So basically the same thing, just showcasing what she created. Her design, her work.
And, you know, the only thing she has is actually… A.
Text hook.
Sports bras can only be practical.
So it's like, okay, a specific peer group, they can instantly identify with that. Everybody who's into sports bras, right? So the instant clarity part is here, and then a curiosity gap, like, where's this leading? Plus, it kind of looks beautiful. And then it's slowly revealing
not revealing it right from the beginning, like, okay, what is this? Is this something maybe I need? And then, okay, interesting. And then, the second thing they do is, they go ahead.
And read everything there.
And suddenly people are like, okay.
That's for me. I'm interested, right?
And then she actually took it a notch further, and,
Because, basically, one of the frameworks we teach inside my programs is storytelling, right? Especially if you want to showcase a process, if you have craft, if you craft something, stuff like this. And storytelling, especially for artists.
if you didn't get that by now, it's honestly the most important skill that you can learn, and the most important framework you can apply to your content. So let's take a look at this one. 1.5 million views, 52,000 likes. That's quite a lot of likes. Just imagine people
hitting that like button, just insane. So, let's just look at this really quickly, right there.
Because you'll understand in a second. It's basically an ad as well, the same thing.

This 150-year-old athletic corset puts your modern sports bra to shame. I've had my share of disappointing sports bra, too, so I decided to create something better. Turned out you need 46 pattern pieces, built in Balconette bra cups, and this front-place metal zipper to only build out the structure. But the real magic came when we added this custom design
shaping fabric from Italy, which will adjust to your body shape over time. Pair that with all the curved stretch seams that guide these 46 fabric panels in just the right way, you get a fit that's far beyond anything your basic 3-piece sports bra ever could.
heyDominik
heyDominik
00:53:53
Right? So it's basically an ad as well, just doesn't feel like one, right? She… because she connects… she, first of all, tells a story, she connects the pain points, the sires, and basically needs of the target audience, and essentially, it's a pretty good ad for her fashion.
And the important thing is, if you look at this right now, Anna didn't sell her soul, right? She didn't make click-baity content, and she didn't do anything that compromises her art, basically, because that's what it is. She basically just learned the language of the platform and
She used the language to get it in front of the right people, right?
So, That's the only thing that mattered to get her work seen by literally the right people.
So, yeah.
The same concept, actually, we applied, to Karthik. If you're here, say hello.
M…
Yeah, Amelia says, totally not my style, but now I want one. Well, there you go. But yeah, the exact same concept we actually applied to Karthik, who basically is, you know, a DJ, if you will, a producer, who grew from 3,000 to 88,000 followers after, yeah, working with us.
If you look… oh, there you go, yeah?
That's the…
That's the growth curve, how it can be. You can see how the algorithm always tries to find people if you do it the right way. Awesome. The same thing applied to, Yvonne.
who is an artisanal furniture designer, basically, who grew from, I think he just had 200 followers or something like this, to now over 127,000 followers, and he sells out drops, and I'm sure you've seen this lamp somewhere, because it's, you know, making its round nowadays, a lot.
Orginet.
Who basically totally went viral showing her knitting work, and you know, she's now selling knitting patterns to her over, what does she have? 193,000 followers.
And she actually started working with us with 40,000. It was kind of stagnant, and you can totally see when things got propelled. This is when she started working with us and implementing all these systems that we talked about today.
You know, obviously, these were, so far, just some systems. The same principles apply to Austin and Colin, who… I don't even know what their niche really is. Let me know if you know them. But they went from, I believe it was around 15,000 to close to 100,000 now.
After joining the mentorship, and they get featured around the whole country, if you don't know them. They probably made a song about your city, or something like this. They're awesome, just check them out yourself. But, essentially the same thing.
And the same concept also applied for all of these clients, which is just a very small, actually random, you know, sample of people in the art space, basically, that we've helped in the last, you know, years, almost a decade.
And, for example, George, here in the top left corner, he's actually a New York City-based tattoo artist. And, you know, he just expanded and opened his second tattoo shop. You know, gets hundreds of thousands of views, and he's booked out, obviously. And also worked with, for Chicago Music Exchange.
You know, it's not… this one's not a vintage guitar, but I wish it were. But they basically, have been selling more vintage guitars than ever after joining the mentorship. It also worked for Jason Choi. If anybody knows him, let me know, this would be awesome, because he's a comedian.
And, he went from 7 to almost 20K now after joining, getting featured in, well, you know…
It's awesome. Look at this, somebody knows Jason. I love it. This makes my heart warm.
Cause he's really funny.
I have to say. And it also applied, for example, for Lucy, a UK-based videographer, going from, I believe it was around 2,000, stagnant, to now over 50,000 followers. And she's now working with the biggest brands in the whole world. She made an actual commercial shoot with Sony.
or the documentary for the Eurovision Song Contest and stuff like this, which is just insane, if you think about this.
And, it even applied for our client Eduardo from, Brazil, basically, who creates artistic pasta.
See? I didn't even know that was a thing. But he actually grew from 60,000 to almost half a million followers right now, let me see, 400-something. And he actually launched his own pasta line in supermarkets, and look at this. Look at the reach he's getting. So yeah.
Now, The point being here is…
The same will apply to you as well, because the principles are the same if you're a singer, songwriter, a DJ, music producer, a painter, illustrator, a digital artist.
or a painter, which is an offline artist, I guess. A photographer, videographer, a writer, a poet, a filmmaker, a graphic designer, or any performer, or basically any kind of artist or creative. Remember, there was somebody knitting, right? Which, you know, is literally…
something you wouldn't even think… I did not think of that before I actually worked with,
Somebody before Jeanette, so we've… we have multiple people.
So, yeah.
And Nika says, what if you're multidisciplinary? We're gonna have a Q&A in a second, actually. We're… I think we're gonna have a Q&A, literally.
In 10 seconds. But before we're gonna have the Q&A, let me just tell you something that we've been working on for a while, and something that I want you guys to really, really know, because,
I'm super proud to announce something that we've been working on for a while.
Basically, what I call the artist cohort. And it's a personal, a very hands-on, a very intimate.
group cohort, where you work with me personally, my team, over the course of 6 weeks. It's starting 1st March, and so far, you know, like I said, it's only been possible for artists. We only could take artists as part of the one-on-one mentorship, and with cohorts, we always was like, well.
we can't take you as an artist because most other people were, you know, in the business niche, and consultants, and coaches, and stuff like this. So, and as you hopefully now have seen, that some of these elements are different, and some of… we need to apply diff… a sort of a different… the same but different sort of rulebook right here.
And, with that being said, we've, built…
a thing that I'm actually super proud of, it's very intimate, it's very personal, so you get to work with me, really. We're gonna be there twice to three times a week, actually. No question will get unanswered. And, yeah, basically.
I'll walk you through the whole step, through the whole system.
over the course of 6 weeks, helping you build your artist brand, your creative brand to the next level, and yeah, you're gonna walk out of there with a real… first of all, with a content strategy that works, and second of all, with a clear roadmap, not just during this, but we're gonna actually hand you something based on you.
that you can just implement over the next months, and you'll never run out what to do, and you'll know what's going on, right? So, that is…
basically what's gonna happen. We're going to start pretty soon, first March, and we actually have a very special offer, slash a special for everyone who's here right now.
Now, the question is, is Florian right here? Because I believe he has something to say about this. And I'm gonna have to, take some… some water sip.
And then we're gonna go straight into the Q&A.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:02:01
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Dominic, for that presentation. People are absolutely loving it.
I know there's some familiar faces in here, so hello to everyone that already had a conversation with me in the recent days, and of course, some of our former clients that I saw in here as well. My name's Florian, I'm Dominic's Community Manager, and I'm super proud to, yeah, announce the…
the first artist cohort that we have coming up. Dominic, could you please, type the link in the chat so people can check out the actual, yeah, website, the info page for the artist cohort? There we go, it's right there.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:02:39
There's something we haven't announced to anyone, and
Once this will be announced, expect this thing to fill up, honestly.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:02:47
Yes, you're literally the first people hearing about this. I want to say a few words before we go right into the Q&A. And by the way, you can already use the Q&A function right here to
you know, ask you questions that I will filter through, and Dominic will answer them here in just a minute. But for the artist cohort, it's the very first time Dominic is ever doing something like this.
As he said, so far, with artists, we only were working in a one-to-one capacity, which is designed by nature, the one-to-one mentorship is, for creators who already have
specific revenue thresholds that they hit with their social media accounts, and it also reflects, of course, in the investment. Now, here, very first time, artist cohort.
It's a much lower investment, of course, and there are two bonuses that will apply for everyone who, yeah, books a conversation with me, actually, during the duration of
this workshop.
First one is, it's gonna be 400 USD off, and the second one is, we're going to have, and this is, again, first time we're doing this, 3 one-to-one consulting sessions.
With our head coach.
before the start of the artist cohort on March 1st. So, you're getting a full court experience with Dominic, there's 3 meetings a week.
There is a content platform with over 16 hours of material. Dominic has personally created 7, it's now 8, sorry, 8 custom AI tools that help with
the research, content scripting, the gap finder, we have that as well now. Lots of cool stuff. We're gonna have a Slack channel, where we're gonna be communicating, also directly with Dominic, for the course of these 6 weeks as well.
And, yeah, if you want to be part of that, or you want to at least learn more about it, please go to this website that we have in the chat.
Or send an email to my email address, florianatomic.com, or send me a WhatsApp. I already see 8 messages right there popping up, I will get back to you guys in a second.
On that number, and yeah, we can see if you're a fit, we can see if Dominic can help you, and then we can take it from there. You find all the information, including, of course, also the investment necessary on that website, so make sure to check that out.
And then, you can book a call with me, or have a conversation with me in any of these other ways, and we'll see if it's a good fit, and we can put you on the first ever, and maybe last, artist cohort that Dominic
will ever run.
So, yeah, having said all of that, Dominique, how do you feel? How's your voice? Can we get into the Q&A?
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:05:32
Perfect, I'm ready to answer whatever you throw at me, right? I'm not holding anything back, obviously, I never do.
Okay, perfect.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:05:42
Yeah. Perfect, perfect. So, yeah, I'll look through that here right now, Dominic, and I'll choose,
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:05:48
Sure. So feel free to write it in the Q&A function, it's some, we're hidden here on Zoom.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:05:54
Yes, people are already already…
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:05:56
This way for us to find the questions.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:05:58
people are already, already using that. Don't send me a WhatsApp with a question, right? You can send me the WhatsApp to inquire, to join the artist's core, potentially.
Mmm… Yeah, so…
Okay, yeah, this is a broader question. I know this comes up many, many, many times, in different ways. I know it's broad. Dominic, maybe you can answer it, you know, in a way that's also valuable for everyone else here, but the question is here from Lawrence. He says.
How can I find a gap as a music artist?
Is it about the feeling the listener gets, or what exactly is the value?
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:06:38
That's a very good question, man. It really, really depends. So, the cap can be literally anything. And honestly, as part of you being a musician.
I think there's even less rules about whatever gap there is. It can't be about the feeling of the listener, it can't be about…
a common enemy, or somebody you just don't like, and… or another band. Remember? Probably not, I don't know how old you guys are, but, I just look like I'm just…
I just turned 18, but I'm a lot older than that. And back in the days, the biggest band was… the biggest thing was, see, now you caught me off guard. It was Oasis versus Coldplay, right? Florian, was that so? Was it Oasis versus Coldplay? Yeah.
There was, like, this huge thing going on, like, what do you like? Oh, Oasis versus Radiohead, sorry, man, versus Radiohead.
Oh, Oasis vs. Bloor, are you right? You guys are better than me. Oh, Wim Clonkers, the DJlicious, man, my old friend.
So yeah, Oasis versus Blur. And this, they became so big because they were like, wow, you're an Oasis fan, and you're a Blur fan.
I was an Oasis fan at first, and then I figured out…
that there's some feud going on, and I switched sides, because I resonated more with Blur.
And gorillas. But, so yeah. So it can be literally that. It can be anything in between. It can literally be you.
Having a certain kind of guitar that looks a certain way.
Bonus points for anyone who can name this beautiful piece.
It can be literally anything. It can be the way you talk. It can be…
a certain style in the art, but it doesn't have to be. So, to find it.
We actually, you know, in the court, we actually have a huge thing about, first of all, we have tools to help you find that, but second of all.
You know, certain lists in terms of what can be a gap.
And, the thing is, It can take a while.
For you to find the gap, and… but you…
I have a lot of different gaps, right? So, yeah.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:08:54
Yes.
Thank you, Dominic. Yeah, there is an introspection process we have that, you know, helps you figure it out, but to be honest with you, it also really depends on you as an artist, right? It's not a… it's not a general blanket statement that, you know, helps everyone.
Okay, here, a question that came up a few times. So, Daryl is asking, starting from scratch, scratch, what's your view on a theme page where it's a personal brand? And Anne is asking, should I create a personal brand as in the two artists? I'm going to answer that, Dominic, because that's an easy one, I've listened to you a few times.
The answer is a very clear home run, yes.
It's even a yes, absolutely. As an artist, please, please start a personal brand. Don't ever consider doing anything else. If you've listened to the presentation Dominic has, right, your art, unfortunately, will not speak for itself.
the algorithm will not understand who it's for, and it's very, very, very hard to get consistent views. And I don't want to take that away, obviously that's part of the chord as well.
As an artist.
you're not really just posting your art just for, you know, for people to see it. There's always some underlying, you know, idea behind it, right? You want to build a career, you want to sell.
you know, prints or tickets, or whatever it is, and it's gonna be even that much harder unless you have a personal brand. So, yes, the answer to all of those, should they create a personal brand as a…
Dot, dot dot, artist, yes.
Yes, you should, and honestly, you have to. Dominic, do you agree?
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:10:36
Yes, obviously, I agree, and
Think of… even… we were talking about bands, but, even think of the biggest bands
Still, they were big because of some frontman who was the personal brand, right? Freddie Mercury.
For example, First thing that just comes to my mind. Obviously, Queen being a huge band, but… Cuz…
this guy had a bunch of gaps, I guess, that people were interested in. And coming from that, Sarah, I'm gonna answer a question I saw in the chat over there.
As a musician, how do we get people to even listen when many people browse with their audio off? That's a very good point. Now, here's the thing. First of all, yes, a lot of people browse with their audio off.
Usually, my clients, I tell them, well, you want to create content so good that they actually stop, save it for later when they can't turn on their audio to look at it. Now, the way to do it is.
The funny thing, even if you're a musician and your main form of communicating is music.
the actual way of… something just happened… the actual way of, catching people here are still the visuals. So,
the… There's so many bands right now, musicians, that, some of them we've helped recently, who basically…
have some sort of disrupting visual in their… in their hook. So, for example, there's just one
girl, she's… she's singing, right? It's not something special, honestly, it's just singing. Not bad, but not, like, particularly good.
But she basically, she figured out a way of hooking people in a visual sense. You see the guitar, and she's like, oh, let me just run somewhere, and then she's running in the middle of the street and starts to sing until a car comes.
That's enough to make her recognizable, that's her gap, and people start to listen. So people are like, oh, interesting. That's just very interesting as a pattern interrupt for me, so even if I don't have time to listen, I'm gonna save it for later, and then listen to it. And then, obviously, it depends whether she's good or not.
And whether you like her art or not, but that's something, like Florian said, that has nothing to do with actually getting people to stop and checking out your stuff.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:12:54
Cool. Thank you. Thank you, Dominic.
I… this is one question that I see here from Esther. It's a question that I like to answer. I get it a lot when I have these conversations with… with…
With people, the meetings, to see if Dominic can actually help. And that's the question from Esther. Is it possible to already see growth within the 6 weeks of the quarter? Look, Esther.
Here's a very important thing.
This is not about going viral once or twice. What Dominic does in all of his teachings, mentorships, courses, everything that he does, and especially
with artists, is he builds sustainable long-term growth, sorry, strategies and systems, okay? What it means is.
We're not looking at how many followers do you have on day 0, and how many followers do you have after week 6.
Instead, the goal of this whole 6 weeks, and the purpose of these 6 weeks is.
To have you understand how to design a proper growth strategy that you then use for weeks, months, and years to come.
And if you're in a situation where you're actually growing, and you know how to consistently keep producing that content.
without being a full-time creator, right? You're still an artist.
So you need systems to create that content. If you have that, if you get into that place, you will grow and you'll hit all these numbers consistently. If you paid attention here, in, maybe, Dominic, you can scroll back a little bit, showing… Dominic was showing a bunch of graphs of our former clients.
They're not just growing and then nothing happens, right? It's consistent growth over the years, and when we look back, yeah, this is here, for example, right?
Shanette, she's still growing to this day. So, you know, if you go back to this graph, Dominic, maybe you can go back to Shanette's graph here, the pink one we had here, yes. So, she joined… she worked, started working with Dominic here in October of, 23, and then, as you can see.
She's still growing to this day, so who cares how many followers she had?
6 weeks after October 23, right? It was 70-something, but who cares? She's still using that strategy, and she's still growing consistently. And that should be your goal, right? So, to answer your question, is it possible to see growth within the 6 weeks?
Yes, you can always go viral, it can always blow up, but to be honest, we don't care, and neither should you. We care about building long-term growth strategies, and you should as well.

Beautiful set. Beautifully said.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:15:42
Thank you very much, Dominic.
Okay, that's a… here is a, an interesting…
question from Bethany. I feel like this question comes up a lot, too. Maybe, Dominic, you can dial in, you know, a little bit more on this without getting too technical. I know you could have a whole presentation on this topic here, but the question is, how do you actually come up with pattern interrupts without being too gimmicky?
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:16:08
Huh.
So funny, we've literally just had a session in my mentorship
What's today? Sunday. So we had one on Thursday.
3-hour session talking about this.
If so…
Yeah, I have a lot to say about this, but generally speaking, just something needs to happen every second. Half a second to second. That's it. Can be anything from different visuals, edits, a slight zoom in, different words you use, or…
You know, like, again, just to go back to musician content.
There's, like, this one band who blew up because of these pattern interrupts. They were, like, playing something, and then…
like, the camera panted wildly to the other person, and that just was such a interrupt that, and obviously the music was good, that people kept there. So, yeah,
long story short, there's a gazillion ways to make pattern interrupts that are not gimmicky. So, here's the thing. I'm… I hate any gimmicky type of thing, in case you didn't notice yet. So, whatever I'm gonna teach you on my YouTube channel, on my Instagram, or in the cohort, for example.
There's… it's never gonna be gimmicky.
It's always gonna have a real organic feel to it, and there's always multiple ways of doing it, because the most important thing for me is also that, first of all, people don't…
use the same things over and over again, that it's just too much. But the most important thing is that you feel like you don't lose your integrity, which, especially as an artist.
I think it's harder and more important.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:17:52
Cool, yeah.
Very, very nice. Thanks a lot.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:17:55
Bethany, sorry, I just see… are you the same? You said, how do I identify the elements in my content that make my video do well? After the last webinar, I made a reel that got 277K views and rising. Got me 1,400 followers. Awesome! I love it!
So, as you can see, guys, things work that we talk about here. But, yeah, so the elements, generally speaking, are…
what we talked about today, think of the hook. Most likely, it's something in the hook that made people think, okay, this is super relevant, and this is super interesting for me.
And then the secondary part of this is obviously,
Hidden somewhere in your, in your insights.
Probably in the… in the retention graph.
Try to find if there's a dip somewhere, or, like, something that goes up.
So…
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:18:49
Cool. I see so many cool questions coming in, so, yeah, before we get into part two of the Q&A here.
Maybe, Dominique, you can go again a little bit on the info slide. We have…
Just, again, one more time, reminder, Dominique has an artist cohort coming up, starting March 1st.
In order for you to join or to apply first.
go to the link I'm posting right now in the chat, or send me an email to Florian at heyDominic.com, or send me a text here on my WhatsApp. I'm already chatting with some of you, right here. The rest of you will have the conversation
Right after we end, this stream. If you reach out.
during this stream, either by booking a call in my calendar on the link below, on the info page, or sending me an email, or sending me the first message in WhatsApp, you will have
$400 USD off on the artist's Court, and you will get 3 additional one-to-one consulting sessions with Dominic before we… with our team, of course, before we start the cohort, March 1st.
With Dominic. Three meetings a week, we have a content platform, go over 16 hours of material, a custom AI hub with 8 unique AI content creation tools that Dominic personally programmed.
We have a Slack channel for communication throughout the 6 weeks. Lots of other stuff.
Have the conversation, reach out to me, we'll see if it applies to you or not. And, yeah, we can take it from there.
Yeah, let's go into some more questions.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:20:32
There's so many cool questions.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:20:34
Got it.
Way, way too many.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:20:36
I want to apologize.
99 for me here in Dubai.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:20:40
100%, yeah, we will 100% not be able to answer all questions today, right? It's completely overwhelming.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:20:45
I were.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:20:46
Yeah, artists are definitely more, more active than the coaches, consultants that we, you know, so often work with as well, so thanks, thanks for that.
I want to answer this question that comes up here in a bunch of different versions as well.
So, yeah, the question is here, how can a brand make more income without being based on a personal brand? A brand that sells educational resources?
So, I'm sorry you're in the wrong call.
you can, still, obviously, text me. We work with, obviously, educational creators, very often as well. This call is for artists specifically. You can still text… send me an email or text me. We can,
Can walk you through how we usually also work with educational creators, but, today it's all about the artists.
And it's all about having people who have a real talent.
And help them, you know, be seen and show that to the world.
Cool,
Yeah, Dominic, this is a type of question that comes up often here, too. Jasmine asks, as an artist who's drawing realistic drawings with pencil.
Who needs weeks or even months for one content, for one piece of art.
I'm lacking ideas to post consistently, or even once a week.
what ideas should I realize to post in between?
My artwork's being finished.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:22:17
So, the good thing about short-form content is, it literally, virtually, has no memory. So…
you can… if you think you repeat yourself, you're not repeating yourself, especially not for art. You might think, okay, you might get one or two…
comments where people are like, oh, but this is the same thing I've seen over and over again.
No,
if you basically have one huge grand piece, and I know another person, I've worked with one, actually, that's very similar to you, I guess, years ago, when I first started out, was,
Like, she too, I think it took her 4-6 months to create a painting.
Or, like, a drawing, and look, like, real, right? So, the thing in this is, you just need to find angles, different angles, and you can't repeat them, just… not obviously
Copy them, but repeat the frameworks and the formats.
And, just create content, first of all, around the process of you creating it, around small little details about it, and then showing the big one, about any type of thing you can show, you can answer questions that people have, because people, especially with art like yours, there's gonna be a lot of questions, so you can go in there, so…
It's not like… and this is kind of what I want everyone here to forget, what… because what you guys might think is, okay, you have your art, so I create my painting, or whatever it is, and it's done.
I won't post it once, and I can't post it anymore. It's like the people on the Oscars who are like, I wore my t-shirt already, my black t-shirt, so I can't wear it anymore. By the way, that's what I do. I throw it away every day, because otherwise you guys would know. Hahaha, such a funny joke here at the end of the day. But,
You don't. So, you can't, and you need to milk everything as much as possible.
And obviously there's ways to do that without losing your integrity. That's the most important thing.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:24:16
Cool, yeah, there's one really interesting question, I think that needs…
you know, be answered from a few different angles. So, Dominic, I'll give my answer, and maybe you can add on top of that afterwards as well. It's a very interesting question by Aaron here. He says, how come I see artists sharing their work with no hook, no marketing, and it still blows up?
Is it just because the work itself transcends these things?
Or is the visual providing the hook? Aaron.
Very, very good question. I get asked this question.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:24:51
Very good question.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:24:53
Look, Social media, in general, you need to understand, is a place where
a lot of people post to a lot of users, okay? There's billions of users on social media these days. And…
Whatever you see.
no matter what corner of the algorithm you get to, is always just a small representation of what's actually going on, okay? There is a huge problem of
You know, survivorship bias on social media.
And…
You know, in our line of work, helping people to grow on social media, we see a lot of creators
Who post, in some cases, Hundreds of times per year, and never get any views.
Okay?
So, what I want to say is, just because something works, doesn't mean the same idea is good, or the same idea works for everyone, okay? And so, when we talk about, for example, about singers.
it can be that there's something, you know, that hooks people that they don't even know is there, right? But it works for this specific content piece for that reason.
And then people try to recreate that, and it doesn't work for them at all, because they don't understand why exactly that thing worked.
And oftentimes, I can tell you that from my conversations as Dominic's community manager with people who reach out to us.
Very, very often, people go viral once, get a lot of views, and then they never get any views again, and they have no idea why they got views on this one content piece in the first place.
Right? So, you only see the things that work, you don't see the things that don't work, because by nature of it, well, they get no views, which means no one sees it.
Right?
And just seeing things sometimes go viral by accident is often not a representation of
Yeah, of what actually works and what doesn't.
in the niche.
Dominique, what are your thoughts on that?
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:27:06
So, I agree, obviously, but there's another layer to that, because it depends who the artist is, and who the creator is, because…
the algorithms… are essentially just an extension of people. And if you remember, this whole… instant clarity.
Especially the instant clarity part of…
How to make a hook that gets people to stop.
Now, if… I told you before, you need to always assume a person does not know you.
Whenever you create content. So always assume it's the… whatever you create, it's for people seeing you for the first time ever.
So, you need to make sure to embed this instant clarity. And just posting the art.
doesn't do it. So think of, remember, Consty from before.
He takes these awesome, award-winning photos. He took them before already, but nobody knew him. So he could post a lion, or whatever.
And nobody could care.
Now, they know him, they have some backstory, they know how he's trying to also help conserve some animals, and he's on these trips, and people are like, yeah, I'm already waiting to see your next trip and where you're going, and then they're like, yeah, I've seen your stories, I've seen you go to Antarctica, which he actually did.
And they're like, I want to see the pictures there.
And then he posts this, and suddenly he has people actively waiting for this, and people seeing his face, slash, you know, his username.
And that… just them seeing that it's from him.
kind of, you know, takes off the instant clarity part. So the algorithm also is like, oh, there's so many people who like it, so I get the data. So…
I'm gonna show it to more people, right? And then the art speaks for itself.
But that can only happen if you have a critical mass to begin with, who are into whatever you do, who instantly know what you are about and what your content is.
Basically.
About, and also the context of it.
So, point being… To make things short.
I say this to all our business-focused clients a lot, but it's even more true for artists and creatives. Do not ever look at and copy
Big creators, and see what they do, and do anything remotely close to what they do.
Because that's gonna not even just not work, it might even backfire, because people might be like, well.
What's wrong with you, right?
So, yeah.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:29:43
Yeah, I… I don't want to get too technical here, but…
Dominic is 100% right, obviously. One of the things that I know that's in his process that he always shows to our clients, one of the first things is
You don't want to be just looking at the big creators in your niche, or that you resonate with.
A big part of figuring out what works on social media in general is finding people who are fast-growing right now.
if someone gets 100,000 views of a million followers, it doesn't mean much. If they have 10,000 followers, they get 100,000 views, it means a lot more. And
Yeah, I don't think we have time for a full demo of the AI Hub right now, but I know that, you know, Dominic, in the… in the…
The tracking tool, for example, that you personally programmed.
What happens there is you can enter accounts that you want to have analyzed, you want to have their content analyzed, and
it does not only show you how many views these specific content pieces got, it also ranks them by performance baseline score, right? And, without going into too many technical details here.
You want to basically also always look at what's the performance of this content piece related to… or in relation to the content that the account puts out, and yeah, it's now automatic in your AI Hub tool, right?
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:31:11
Yeah, basically scores per outliers. So, somebody's always in a certain range, baseline range, so this is normal for the account. So, obviously.
different factors come into play, so maybe the account size. But even for bigger ones, but I would not recommend you to look at bigger ones at all, honestly, especially as an artist, like I said. But even for whatever type of account.
Some of them are gonna have outliers, and we assigned them an outlier score.
So you can see, okay, within their baseline, this, this, and this reel, or carousel, did 3…
5, sometimes 30x.
Of their baseline score.
And then, you can go ahead and look at these posts individually and be like, okay, basically what we just talked about. What the
especially for you, what made people particularly interested in that thing? About some emotional aspects, about the hook, about the angle, about the topic, whatever it is, and that's what we're gonna figure out. And then.
We have tools, or the tools, basically, ways of… Using that intel.
And wrapping it around your niche, to really… Make it your own thing.
So, it's not like a copy of something, it's really your own thing. You wouldn't believe some of the content pieces that…
we've created like this, that are basically… it's basically Star Wars and,
What's the other movie that's basically the same?
anything, basically. Basically, Star Wars… 4 and Star Wars 7 are the same exact movie, as is Bambi.
I think.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:32:57
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cool. Julia, you ask, how do you find the fast-growing people in the niche, aside from using the tool you develop? Well, the problem is that's a process that takes, you know, an hour, hour and a half every week that Dominic used to show people manually. We're not going to go into that, because it's solved now with the new tools, right?
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:33:19
Yeah, but also, like, on… let me just… just as a, like, a one-sentence answer here, just go to your Instagram and look up…
your… your… some broad keywords, and then just save them. Save the best videos, two, three videos that you find into a folder, and then you're gonna magically see, slowly, the algorithm shows you some people.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:33:43
Yeah. And then you go from there.
But to actually see if they're growing or not, right? You need to look.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:33:48
They're growing.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:33:49
a time frame on a regular basis, and then you'll basically see that. So, obviously it's much easier with that tool, which backtracks everything.
Yeah, other than that, just manually.
Discover and, and track people.
Okay.
Cool, so many very interesting questions here, absolutely impossible to go throughout them. I would say, Dominic.
15, 15 minutes more? What do you think? You still have a voice following up? Let's do 15 more questions. None of them. Four hours.
We could even do that easily, we have so many questions today.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:34:24
Like I said, I literally just, a few days ago, we had a more than 3-hour session into mentorship. Sometimes it's going crazy in there.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:34:33
Yeah, I'm… Yeah, the slots are in my calendar, also filling up, so, make sure, just a reminder.
If you want to be part of the first ever artist course.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:34:43
And maybe only, honestly.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:34:46
potentially only one, that Dominique is running.
make sure to go to the artist cohort page, which I just posted in the chat. You see all the information there, including pricing, including, you know, the curriculum, many more things on there as well.
You can book a call with me, I'm Florian, Dominic's community manager, on that page as well. We can have a conversation, we can see if you're an artist, right? If that makes sense for you to work with us.
And, yeah, answer all your questions, of course. You can also send me an email, floorness atominic.com.
or send me a WhatsApp.
to that number. If you actually reach out within the next 15 minutes for the duration of this call, you will get 400 USD off on a cohort, and we have 3 one-to-one sessions
with Dominic's team before we start the court officially on March 1st, which I believe to be actually an even more valuable bonus than the $400 off.
So, yeah, if you want to see if that is for you, if you're an artist who wants to grow on social media like the many people Dominic just showed, that he has worked with before, reach out in any of these ways, and we can have a conversation to see if it makes sense for you at this moment in time.
Or it doesn't.
Cool.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:36:09
I see Esther says, so you get the one-on-one before it starts, right? It's also before paying, to see if it fits with where you want to go. Well, this is actually the call, like, if you go to this page right here.
You basically… Fill it out here.
you hop on a call with this guy, right there, with Florian, and obviously, that's gonna… that's not gonna cost you anything. You're gonna talk about your situation, we're gonna take… he's gonna take a look at you, and he… you're gonna be…
Exploring whether the cohort, this artist cohort specifically.
makes sense for you or not, so don't worry, you don't have to pay there, and we're also not gonna pressure you into anything. Yeah, but then after you were in.
Right? Only if you get in right now during the next 15 minutes. First of all, you get $400 off of the price, and we do have payment plans, by the way, because I saw some people ask, because I know how it's like as a starting artist.
And second of all, you're gonna get, then, 3 additional extra one-on-one sessions with my team of content specialists who've helped these people that I showed today.
grow like crazy. And, yeah, you're not gonna be able to get them
afterwards. So if you sign up afterwards for the Artist Cohort, again, it's gonna start on when?
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:37:38
March 1st.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:37:39
Yeah.
And I just saw, I didn't…
This is basically what I wanted to show you. This is where you put your name, last name, phone, and book a meeting right there. That's it. And that's not gonna cost you anything. Don't worry about it.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:37:53
And it has all the information, short video on Dominic explaining the cohort, and some Q&As before that as well, and I'll gladly have a one-hour conversation, which, you know, 30 minutes to 1 hour, with
each single one of you to see if it makes sense, look at your content, and yeah, take it from there. Esther, I know you already have booked the one-to-one session with me, I already see it in my calendar, so…
Obviously, I'm not on the coaching team, I'm a community manager, I just know a thing or two about social media from
having, you know, been very close to this guy for the past decade, so I overheard a few things here and there, but obviously, I'm not my coaching team. Dominic and his team are going to be able to help you even much, much better, with the actual strategy side of things.
I helped develop the product and the course, so I know a lot of things or everything about that's going on there, but in terms of the actual strategy of the chord, I'm not part of that. So, once you come on, we have a… once you decide you want to do it, which hopefully is after that conversation we have.
The way it works is, I send you the mentorship agreement, can be digitally signed, and then has a link to the transaction. As soon as that happens, you get an automated welcome email by this man right there, Hey Dominic, and you book your first
one-to-one consulting session with his team, and you get access to all the content immediately. And then from March 1st, we're meeting 3 times per week until April 10th. We have a content platform with 16 hours of material. We have a Slack channel just exclusive for
There are Discord members for the duration of 6 weeks.
You do get access to the 8 custom AI tools that Dominic personally programmed, and honestly, a few more things that I don't wanna, you know, blow up this rant even longer. So, yeah, reach out to any of these ways, and we'll get it going.
Cool.
Yeah, and
who said it right here, that they're a struggling artist, and they're, you know, they're struggling with, financing this? It's probably…
A much lower investment than any of you guys think, so go on the website.
It's all laid out there. You'll know how much it is, exactly. It's not one of these things you have to have 5 calls with me before we do a price drop and we manipulate you into anything. It's very transparent on there, and we do even have flexibility with payment plans as well. If you don't have, to be completely honest with you as well, right?
Because I understand, with an artist, you might be, or all of you guys might be a different part of your journey. If you don't have
you know, a few hundred dollars per month to spend, no problem, come to the free workshops, watch the free YouTube content, but probably not in a position to work with an elite consultant on your artist career yet, which is not a problem. You might win a few.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:40:52
Yeah, my content is always gonna be free, don't worry about it.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:40:57
Yep.
Absolutely.
Cool, so let's look into more of the questions here. Guys, please make sure to use the Q&A function here.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:41:09
Yeah, I see a lot of them in the chat, also very good ones, by the way.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:41:13
In the chat, it's not really super easy to follow along here.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:41:18
Unfortunately, yeah.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:41:19
Yes, exactly. Yeah, that's one that comes up very often, Dominic, maybe you can answer that one. Is a shadowban a real thing? And is there a way whether to check or not? I'm shadow banned?
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:41:32
well.
Well, I could talk for an hour.
Probably 3 about this.
In the core, we're gonna talk about this a lot at the beginning, but, generally speaking.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:41:42
Yes, a shadow ban can be real in certain…
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:41:47
In certain cases.
But I… it's getting less, it's getting a lot less, and 97% of people that come to me are like, well, I'm shadow banned, for sure.
well, we figure out a way out of this. And they're like, oh, okay, I wasn't shadow man, seems like. So that's the first thing. With certain strategies and posting in the right way.
Don't worry about it. You're gonna get your reach cleared up. There's a way to check, though, if you're actually hard shadow banned, it's the account status. So if you go to your Instagram and then your settings, you scroll somewhere, it's gonna say account status, or you search for it in this bar.
And, you want to have this be all green. It's okay if it's yellow in one thing, which is monetization, or something called,
substantial presence. It's usually, if you don't have a big audience yet, or if you're just starting out, it's just Instagram telling you, well, we can't monetize you, because in certain countries, you technically can get monetized.
But that's some crap thing anyway, so don't worry about this. But, unless there's…
Oh, it's okay in there for you, but don't worry about it.
Yep.
I could go for a way longer rant, But, another day.
Maybe in one of the videos. If you guys are interested.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:43:07
I mean, Dominic, I think I speak… I think I speak for everyone. There's, like, you know, right now there were, like, 150 people in here, for the most of the call.
There's now 36 questions in Q&A. There's probably 20, 25 in the chat, so, you know, every second person is asking a question here, so, I think I speak for everyone when I say we meet another artist workshop pretty soon. You guys are amazing. If you guys want one, I'll make one, so…
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:43:37
Drop all the questions. I'm gonna build it off of whatever you ask right now.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:43:43
Yeah, obviously we're gonna have the artist cohort on March 1st.
I'm just gonna do 5 more minutes of this free workshop. If you wanna work with Dominic personally.
three times a week, in our sessions, in our Slack channel, in… we have access to the AIHub to 16 hours of material on top of all of this.
Three one-to-one sessions with Dominic's team before March 1st. Make sure to go to our page that I posted in the chat right here. It's go.hedominic.com slash artistcoward. Send me an email, fernet at dominic.com, or send me a message in WhatsApp. I can see… we can see together if it makes sense for you.
It's gonna be $400 USD off if you apply for the conversation or send me a message within the next 5 minutes.
Yeah, let's look into some more questions, man, you guys…
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:44:40
There's one question I want to answer.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:44:42
Yes.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:44:43
Gizm says, should we post videos every day, or how often should we post? Is there any algorithm advantage to posting one video per day?
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:44:52
And the answer is…
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:44:54
Yes, but no.
I answered it, goodbye.
No, but, here's what's up.
So…
Generally speaking, posting more helps if you post the right way. Now, that's the short answer. Now, posting once a day, I would not recommend at all anymore, unless you can really pull it off for the long term, and unless it's really…
high-quality content, and high quality not looking good, but actually what your people want to see, right? There's some…
you know, painters who are, like, really just daily sharing the progress in a very simple manner, and people are totally up for that. They're like, I want to see what happens. But it depends, right? So, the problem is.
A lot of the times, people are like, okay, I'm gonna do a challenge, right? Don't do a challenge. Please don't do a challenge. That's, like, 90 days or 60 days, if you don't know what you do, because chances are, you wreck…
Things for a little longer, cause…
You basically just post bad content, and all you do is train the algorithm.
For… basically, that you create bad content. We don't want that. Now, the algorithm also…
loves predictability and consistency way more than actually super high-performing videos. So if you… if you manage to pull off 3 posts a week.
Over the course of 3 months.
and that's all you can do, perfect. Right? Perfect. Later down the line, and that's something that nobody talks about, ever, and I have clear data on that, and clear proof, my own account being one of them.
Once you have a certain standing within the algorithm, once you know how to play the emotions of your audience, once you know how to actually get them hooked, and once you understand the certain content pillars, that just, no matter what, will get you reach.
And you have some sort of audience.
you don't have to be consistent at all anymore. Now, I never say this usually on my YouTube channel, because people are like, then I don't need to post it at all, because at the beginning, and especially if you had longer periods of time off, obviously you need to be way more consistent. But, yeah, I'm just showing you the whole range here about what's up.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:47:10
Perfect, cool. I get a lot of texts to my WhatsApp, and by the way, guys, I'll be with you on here right after we go offline in a couple minutes, and answer every single one of you, okay? So don't worry about that, but I see a lot of people asking what the investment is for the artist cohort.
It's all transparent on the website, but, you know, Dominic just gave you guys 2 hours of free value, so if you want to know how much it is.
Please, we would like to ask you to at least press that link, and go on the page where we've prepared all of the information. So, it's all on there, no problem.
we do have flexible payment plans for that as well. What I can say is…
Usually, when we work with coaches, consultants, experts, we charge them a couple thousand USD more, actually, for the core we run for those people. So this one is the lowest
Investment point that we've ever had on a mentorship cohort, and it's the first one for artists specifically.
And if you apply to call or you send me an email or a WhatsApp within the next
We have 2 minutes before we end this call, you will additionally have $400 USD off as well, so if you ever wanted to take your IG seriously as an artist, as a creative of any kind.
And you've ever…
you know, wondered if Dominic will ever do something like this. Well, that's a very, very good opportunity. We don't know if it will come around again or not.
And even if it will, it will, what I can say for sure, 100% not be, at this price point. That's for sure. Check out the website, you'll see what the price point is. It's all very transparent on there, don't worry about it.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:48:50
By the way, the reason why we're saying we're not sure if we're ever gonna do one again is because I'm, frankly, just booked out with the one-on-one and with the,
With, you know, the other chords for consultants, coaches, stuff like this.
So… That's just how it is.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:49:09
Yeah, obviously, we have one-to-one mentorship, which is, you know, the daily business, working with
big, established creators, also artists in there as well, so we can also obviously have a conversation about that as well, when he booked a call with me.
And then we have, obviously, the cohort for coaches, consultants, experts, which Dominic has said it many times today, is a lot more straightforward.
But still not…
as super easy as people might think. In 2026, social media isn't easy for anyone, really, at the end of the day.
Hmm, but…
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:49:45
fortunately.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:49:46
Yeah, but especially hard for us.
Where?
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:49:49
We're aware of that, but…
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:49:51
This is the most accessible cohort we've ever done, and we probably will ever do so. If you think about working with Dominic as an artist, reach out to me, we'll have the conversation. It's no pressure, nothing like that on the… on…
The call, or any conversation with me.
Just really, yeah, seeing if we can help.
And, yeah, then you can make a decision with full information afterwards.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:50:19
What's the last question.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:50:20
Yeah, let's do the… let's do the last question. There's so many cool questions here.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:50:25
There's so many cool ones. I see one, actually, from the chat, because I see it…
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:50:28
Jordan, go ahead, you choose the last one.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:50:31
So, Smile says… Or however I pronounce your name.
Should boosting a post be the next step after creating your brand strategy? I mean, after you chose your positioning and target audience?
Here's what's up, man. Don't boost your posts. That's not part of the strategy. The strategy is actually organic, that's the most important thing. Organic. Forget the boosting, right? Forget ads. It can work, but it's gonna be really expensive. And, actually.
We have some clients in the 101 who are basically artists as well.
what's it called? Like, digital art, and they have courses.
And they have packs, not just courses, but, like, packs to sell, like, template packs.
You know?
Just makes me think, I lost my Apple Pencil.
Yeah. Anyway, they're relying beforehand mostly on pay, like, ads. Not necessarily boosts, but actually ads they put on Instagram.
metop.
Now…
The other day, I just saw, you know, now, focusing on content creation, organic side of things, still boosting their stuff, or still using the ad strategy, obviously, because that made them some revenue, but now, they got, like.
They're already getting… Twice the amount of people Buying their courses and, packs.
than before, with paid ads. Now, just with organic.
And that just shows you how… how crazy this whole thing is, and the, you know, the potential of organic. So, if you start, don't even think of boosting or anything like that.
you know.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:52:17
Yeah.
It's… it's 100% true. And, just to clarify that, all of the results Dominic has shown today are 100%
with organic traffic, and all we do is help people develop organic growth strategies. Yes, if you run ads, you're actually competing with people who sell products, most of the time digital, and for every dollar they put in, they get $1.20, $1.50 back.
And if you're not getting anything back, please don't try to compete with other people or something yet. So, just to get more followers, more views, more fans…
Not a very good idea.
I'm just with you.
Cool. Perfect. Dominic, thank you so much. I think I speak on behalf of everyone.
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:53:03
when I say it's been truly amazing, I've got a lot of thank you messages in my WhatsApp here in the chat and everywhere else.
Florian Holler
Florian Holler
01:53:11
So, thank you very much for doing this, the first artist cohort.
Again, very last chance for the next 30 seconds. If you want to be part of that artist cohort working with Dominic personally over the course of 6 weeks.
on your brand, on your content, go to the page that I'm posting in the chat.
Right now, or if you want to fast-track your application, send me an email, florinataydominique.com, or a message to my WhatsApp. I will get back to all of you guys' messages here that I already have.
Stacked up in my WhatsApp and my email address right after this.
And, yeah, thank you so much for… for showing up, for participating. Dominic, do you have any last words to say to your community before we sign off?
heyDominik
heyDominik
01:53:59
Yeah, so, first of all, thanks everyone for being here. A lot of you guys showed up, which is amazing, and a lot of… one thing that really surprised me, I have to say, is you guys had very good questions, so keep the questions going. Send your questions to hi at HeyDominic.com if you have more
You know, or comment it below my videos.
You know, so I can create content and also prepare another artist cohort, not cohort, I mean, workshop, you know, maybe in a few weeks. And, with that being said, everyone, I've taken a look at some of your content already, you know, because I was picking this one person.
For… for the hook stuff, greetings to Australia. It's probably already 6 or 7 AM in the morning. Crazy.
And, yeah, you guys have some cool stuff going on, so the potential is there, and I really love what I see. With that being said.
Thanks a lot, everyone. I'm gonna go to bed, because it's 11 PM, and I'll see you soon. Keep your content coming, and
Thanks a lot, everyone, for joining.
Bye-bye.
